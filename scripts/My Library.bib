  abstract = {Despite of the generalized expansion of wild ungulates in Europe, roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) is experiencing contrasted population trends; it is expanding in some regions while declining in others likely due to the expansion of other deer species. In both extremes, reliable methods to estimate population abundance are required. We evaluated different methods of estimating deer abundance in Mediterranean woodlands based on pellet group counts. Distance Sampling applied to pellet counts and a new easier and cost-effective method based on strip-variable transect counts (FST) were assessed comparing their estimates (pellet group density) with the abundance indices obtained from traditionally used reference methods (faecal standing crop) in 61 localities (n = 183 surveys). The average roe deer density estimated from faecal standing crop was 5.56 +/- 0.75 (range 0.01-20.74) deer per 100 ha. Distance Sampling and FST estimates correlated with reference methods. As a first conclusion it may be noted that all indirect methods used here can be used to estimate roe deer abundance. The selection of a given method based on pellet counts to estimate roe deer population abundance should take into account the specific objectives of the research, resources available, and the timescale in which the information is required. Among them, Distance Sampling may be used when human resources and skills are enough but FST is a rapid and efficient alternative to estimate pellet group density when they are not.

  abstract = {Sampling strategies commonly used for coarse woody debris (CWD) inventories, including line intersect sampling (LIS), typically require large sample sizes to estimate aggregate volume with reasonable precision. Line intersect distance sampling (LIDS) is a recently developed strategy based on a probability proportional-to-volume design and a linear sampling unit. In principle, the design augments the precision of volume estimators by increasing the intensity with which bulkier particles are sampled, while the transect-based protocol facilitates the search for qualifying particles. This study reports on the relative performances of LIDS and LIS in seven stands in Montana, USA. Particles selected by LIDS were consistently less numerous but larger in cross section than those selected at the same locations by LIS. In timed field trials, LIDS required more time than LIS, but CWD volume estimates from LIDS were generally more precise, more than offsetting the time differential. Conversely, aggregate length and abundance of CWD were generally estimated more efficiently with LIS. Results suggest that LIDS permits more efficient use of survey resources than LIS where CWD inventories focus on parameters relating to volume, biomass, or carbon. However, the constant volume factor design of LIDS is not advantageous where CWD frequency is of central interest.},

We have developed a multiple-species modelling framework that uses similarities in capture/detection processes among species to model multiple species data more parsimoniously. We present examples of this approach applied to distance, time of detection and multiple observer sampling for avian point count data. Models that included species as a covariate and individual species effects were generally selected as the best models for distance sampling, but group models without species effects performed best for the time of detection and multiple observer methods. Population estimates were more precise for no-species-effect models than for species-effect models, demonstrating the benefits of exploiting species' similarities when modelling multiple species data. Partial species-effect models and additive models were also useful because they modelled similarities among species while allowing for species differences. Synthesis and applications. We recommend the adoption of multiple-species modelling because of its potential for improved population estimates. This framework will be particularly beneficial for modelling count data from rare species because information on the detection process can be 'borrowed' from more common species. The multiple-species modelling framework presented here is applicable to a wide range of sampling techniques and taxa.},

  abstract = {Finding an adequate measure of hunting sustainability for tropical forests has proved difficult. Many researchers have used urban bushmeat market surveys as indicators of hunting volumes and composition, but no analysis has been done of the reliability of market data in reflecting village offtake. We used data from urban markets and the villages that supply these markets to examine changes in the volume and composition of traded bushmeat between the village and the market (trade filters) in Equatorial Guinea. We collected data with market surveys and hunter offtake diaries. The trade filters varied depending on village remoteness and the monopoly power of traders. In a village with limited market access, species that maximized trader profits were most likely to be traded. In a village with greater market access, species for which hunters gained the greatest income per carcass were more likely to be traded. The probability of particular species being sold to market also depended on the capture method and season. Larger, more vulnerable species were more likely to be supplied from less-accessible catchments, whereas there was no effect of forest cover or human population density on probability of being sold. This suggests that the composition of bushmeat offtake in an area may be driven more by urban demand than the geographic characteristics of that area. In one market, traders may have reached the limit of their geographical exploitation range, and hunting pressure within that range may be increasing. Our results demonstrate that it is possible to model the trade filters that bias market data, which opens the way to developing more robust market-based sustainability indices for the bushmeat trade.},

  abstract = {Pellet group count methods are key tools for wildlife conservation and management. Therefore, it is essential to clarify the performance and suitability of the different pellet group count methods at distinct realities. This issue has been discussed by other researchers but with inconsistent conclusions, leaving open the necessity of additional studies. Aiming to fill this need, we used a combination of field data and simulation models to evaluate the density estimates, precision and potential accuracy of the results obtained through each pellet group count method, and also the sampling effort and efficiency associated with them. The methods evaluated were standing crop plot counts (FSCP), clearance plot counts (FAR), standing crop strip transect counts (ST) and standing crop line transect counts (LT). Deer density estimates by the four methods were statistically similar at all effort levels simulated. The analyses of CV trends reveal a better precision supplied by FSCP than by FAR for the same effort, while ST and LT yielded comparable values in analogous situations. The time required to make a survey is a key factor in the choice of a field technique. LT with distance sampling was the most efficient method to count pellet groups, while FAR seems to be the less proficient method. Attending to the limitations usually inherent to field surveys, like time, technicians and budget, LT appeared more efficient than the other methods, providing great precision and accuracy in less time. Nevertheless, at high densities and pronounced habitat heterogeneity, FAR became more efficient than FSC, do not requiring the decay rates, allowing accurate estimates in a few months when applied with the proper effort and environmental conditions. This study highlights the importance of carrying out pilot studies and simulation models to evaluate the sampling design prior to its implementation in the field.

  abstract = {Tree height is an important variable in forest inventory programs but is typically time-consuming and costly to measure in the field using conventional techniques. Airborne light detection and ranging (lidar) provides individual tree height measurements that are highly correlated with field-derived measurements, but the imprecision of conventional field techniques does not allow for definitive assessments regarding the absolute accuracy of lidar tree height measurements and the relative influence of beam divergence setting (i.e., laser footprint size), species type, and digital terrain model (DTM) error on the accuracy of height measurements. In this study, we developed a methodology for acquiring accurate individual tree height measurements ({$<$}2 cm error) using a total station survey and used these measurements to establish the expected accuracy of lidar- and field-derived tree height measurements for two of the most ecologically and commercially significant species in western North America, Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) and ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa). Tree height measurements obtained from narrow-beam (0.33 m), high-density (6 points/m2) lidar were more accurate (mean error ± SD = –0.73 ± 0.43 m) than those obtained from wide-beam (0.8 m) lidar (–1.12 ± 0.56 m). Lidar-derived height measurements were more accurate for ponderosa pine (–0.43 ± 0.13 m) than for Douglas-fir (–1.05 ± 0.41 m) at the narrow beam setting. Although tree heights acquired using conventional field techniques (–0.27 ± 0.27 m) were more accurate than those obtained using lidar (–0.73 ± 0.43 m for narrow beam setting), this difference will likely be offset by the wider coverage and cost efficiencies afforded by lidar-based forest survey.},

  abstract = {Protected area management must be resourced adequately to achieve its conservation objectives. The variability in management costs across candidate sites for protection therefore should inform conservation planning. For example, when considering whether to accept a donation of a property, a conservation organisation must determine whether an adequate endowment is available to fund future management activities. We examine variation in management costs across 78 small protected areas in the UK that are managed by a conservation NGO, the Yorkshire Wildlife Trust. Management costs exceed acquisition costs when funded on an endowment basis and are not correlated with acquisition costs or with proxy measures for conservation costs commonly relied upon in conservation planning studies. A combination of geographic, ecological and socioeconomic characteristics of sites explains 50\% of the variation in management costs. Site area is the most important determinant of management costs, which demonstrate economies of scale; implementing conservation management on an additional hectare adjacent to a larger protected area would incur a lower cost than doing the same adjacent to a smaller site. In evidencing this effect of site area, we avoid problems of spurious correlation that confound previous studies. Protected areas that encompass a greater richness of priority habitats for conservation also require more expensive management. Conservation organisations may have little option but to create small protected areas to conserve biodiversity in highly fragmented landscapes, but the decision to do so should take account of the greater cost burden that small protected areas incur.

With a single-scan setup, there will be a nondetection of trees in a plot and the representation of the individual trees will be incomplete. We explore how stand-level volume estimates, based on the single-scan mode, perform compared with standard inventory estimates. We base our study on 166 plots in 12 mature stands dominated by Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) and Norway spruce (Picea abies L. Karst) in southern Norway. First, we compare individual-tree volume estimates from TLS with estimates from volume functions and measurements from harvesters. We show that individual-tree volumes can be estimated with high precision and accuracy with TLS in single-scan mode. Secondly, we test three approaches for correction of nondetection relying on model-based estimates of the detection probability obtained by point transect sampling estimators. We show that all three approaches adjust for nondetection and yield stand-level volume estimates that are similar to those obtained by fixed-area sampling. In conclusion, our results indicate that stand-level volume estimates, based on single-scan mode TLS data, perform well compared with standard inventory estimates.},

  abstract = {Fire is a natural disturbance process that shapes ecosystems worldwide and influences the distribution of many species of plants and animals. In fire-prone regions, planning for both fire management and biodiversity conservation requires a sound understanding of fire history and spatial patterns. However, in many fire-prone areas, accurate fire records and systematic fire maps are lacking. We used Landsat imagery to map the fire history of the Murray Mallee region of southeastern Australia from 1972 to 2007. Our study in this semi-arid, fire-prone ecosystem encompassed an area of 104,000 km2. An area equivalent to 40\% of the tree-mallee vegetation (vegetation characterised by small, multi-stemmed eucalypts) was burnt during the 35-year period, but less than 3\% of tree-mallee experienced more than one fire in this time. Large fires ({$>$}10,000 ha) accounted for 89\% of the area burnt, and were the main influence on the distribution of fire age-classes in conservation reserves. Different vegetation types burned disproportionately, illustrating the value of combining region-wide vegetation mapping with fire history mapping. Although the perception is that large fires occur on an approximately decadal cycle following years of above-average rainfall, our analyses revealed that above-average rainfall is not the only influence on large fires. The distribution of fire age-classes differed between reserves and across states, highlighting the need to manage fire-prone landscapes at ecologically meaningful regional-scales that cross jurisdictional boundaries. Systematic and consistent mapping of fires in fire-prone regions is an essential foundation for improved fire management and more effective landscape planning for conservation.},

  abstract = {Poaching of tigers and their key prey threatens the survival of tigers across their range. This study investigated the methods, intensity, and driving factors of tiger and prey poaching in the Sundarbans Reserved Forest of Bangladesh, to help better design and direct future management interventions. The study identified a range of snaring methods used to catch prey and an approach to killing tigers by poisoning prey carcasses with a Carbofuran pesticide. We recorded six poisoned baits set to kill tigers and 1427 snare loops in 56 snare sets to kill tiger prey. With an average of 23 snare loops/snare set, this is equivalent to an estimated 6268 snare loops across the Sundarbans or 147 snare loops/100 km(2). Poachers selected sites that tended to be away from guard posts, and close to river banks, but were not influenced by protected area status or distance to the forest boundary. The current poaching pressure is likely to have contributed to a recent decline in relative tiger abundance. We recommend using better regulation of Carbofuran use across tiger range countries, and using remote camera traps set up around snares and poisoned baits to help authorities identify poachers for arrest. This study demonstrates a simple approach to investigating the methods, intensity and distribution of poaching, that could be replicated across all tiger landscapes to better direct mitigating actions and monitor changes in threat levels over time.

  abstract = {Ongoing marine monitoring programs are seldom designed to detect changes in the environment between different years, mainly due to the high number of samples required for a sufficient statistical precision. We here show that pooling over time (time integration) of seasonal measurements provides an efficient method of reducing variability, thereby improving the precision and power in detecting inter-annual differences. Such data from weekly environmental sensor profiles at 21 stations in the northern Bothnian Sea was used in a cost-precision spatio-temporal allocation model. Time-integrated averages for six different variables over 6 months from a rather heterogeneous area showed low variability between stations (coefficient of variation, CV, range of 0.6-12.4\%) compared to variability between stations in a single day (CV range 2.4-88.6\%), or variability over time for a single station (CV range 0.4-110.7\%). Reduced sampling frequency from weekly to approximately monthly sampling did not change the results markedly, whereas lower frequency differed more from results with weekly sampling. With monthly sampling, high precision and power of estimates could therefore be achieved with a low number of stations. With input of cost factors like ship time, labor, and analyses, the model can predict the cost for a given required precision in the time-integrated average of each variable by optimizing sampling allocation. A following power analysis can provide information on minimum sample size to detect differences between years with a required power. Alternatively, the model can predict the precision of annual means for the included variables when the program has a pre-defined budget. Use of time-integrated results from sampling stations with different areal coverage and environmental heterogeneity can thus be an efficient strategy to detect environmental differences between single years, as well as a long-term temporal trend. Use of the presented allocation model will then help to minimize the cost and effort of a monitoring program.},

However, determining the survey effort required to reliably detect population change can be challenging for rare, cryptic and elusive species. We used a tropical bromeliad-dwelling frog as a model system to explore a cost-effective sampling design that optimizes the chances of detecting a population decline. Relatively few sampling visits were needed to estimate occupancy and detectability with good precision, and to detect a 30\% change in occupancy with 80\% power. Detectability was influenced by observer expertise, which therefore also had an effect on the sampling design -less experienced observers require more sampling visits to detect the species. Even when the sampling design provides precise parameter estimates, only moderate to large changes in occupancy will be detected with reliable power. Detecting a population change of 15\% or less requires a large number of sites to be surveyed, which might be unachievable for range-restricted species occurring at relatively few sites. Unless there is high initial occupancy, rare and cryptic species will be particularly challenging when it comes to detecting small population changes. This may be a particular issue for long-term monitoring of amphibians which often display low detectability and wide natural fluctuations.},

We evaluated line transect sampling methodology, using track and cross-county transects, and assessed its conformity to underlying assumptions for use in estimating density of chiru in the ca 2,300 km2 Aru Basin, Tibet. Although violations of some assumptions were apparent, they were generally not substantial, and simple adjustments of sampling design can reduce their effects in future surveys. Sampling effort was not sufficient to demonstrate clear seasonal differences in chiru density between summer and autumn. However, cross-country transects on the west side of the study area did show a statistically significant higher autumn than summer density, and encounter rates (the number of detections per km) were significantly higher for both transect types in autumn. We tested for an expected negative bias associated with track transects, and although a clear difference in estimated density was not found, a significantly higher encounter rate was present for cross-country than for track transects. With increased sampling effort and a more effective design in future surveys, line transect sampling will be a useful methodology for assessment of chiru pop­ ulations.},

  abstract = {Reliable methods to estimate species richness are very important to managers and conservationists because they provide key data to make the right decisions in conservation programmes. In the case of carnivore mammals, traditional methods, such as direct count censuses, are not useful since these animals are usually scarce, elusive and nocturnal. Difficulties in carnivore sampling are compounded when monitoring programmes are developed at large spatial scales, where high economic costs and field efforts are necessary to achieve reliable richness or abundance estimates. These problems have highlighted the need to find more effective carnivore survey methods, especially in regions with high rates of landscape change, such as the Mediterranean basin. The present study, performed in a typical Mediterranean area, was the first in Europe to test simultaneously the relative efficiencies of four broad-applied sampling methods to detect carnivore species at large spatial scales. Sign surveys based on scat detection, scent stations, camera-trapping and live-trapping were investigated. We compared efficiencies using biological parameters and by considering both the logistic and economic costs of each method. Overall, scent stations and sign surveys were the most efficient methods both in economic and logistic terms. In addition, the use of scent stations may be necessary to detect species rarely detected by scats. Detailed and extensive training programmes for conducting sign surveys and scent stations may overcome perceived problems thus enhancing the widespread use of both methods. Our results are applicable not only to other Mediterranean areas, but also to other habitats and regions of the world. More research into the suitability of these and other methods in relation to different landscapes, seasons and species is required.},

Such an investment requires a quantitative monitoring approach that allows for the effectiveness of the expenditure to be determined. By combining criminological deterrence theory and spatially explicit field-ranger patrol monitoring, we develop a framework to measure the presence of field-rangers in the landscape. We test this framework empirically by comparing the presence of field-rangers in the landscape against the presence around 40 rhino poaching incidents. We empirically demonstrate that the analysed field ranger human resources and their deployment in a well-staffed protected area in Africa did not deter rhino poachers.},

  abstract = {The recovery of forests following stand-replacing disturbance is of widespread interest; however, there is both a lack of definitional clarity for the term ‘‘recovery” and a dearth of empirical data on the rates of forest recovery associated with different disturbance types. We conducted a quantitative review of literature to determine recovery times following wildfire and timber harvest and to evaluate variation in recovery rates across Canada’s diverse forest ecosystems. Recovery was assessed according to the rate of change associated with certain forest structural attributes that have traditionally been used as indicators of forest growth and productivity. The recovery of forest canopy cover, tree height, and stand basal area varied at rates that depended on disturbance type, forest biome, and ecozone. We found that, on average, it took 5–10 years, depending on factors such as location and species, for most forest ecosystems of Canada to attain a benchmark canopy cover of 10\% after wildfire or harvest. Similarly, regenerating stands in Canada’s boreal forests were capable of attaining average heights of 5 m within five to ten years after wildfire or harvest. Stands in the Boreal Plains ecozone post-harvest reached stand basal area, benchmarked at 10 m2 haÀ1, faster than those in the Boreal Shield, attributable to differences in tree species composition and the rich mineral deposits of the Boreal Plains. Overall, recovery of canopy cover, tree height, and stand basal area was similar or more rapid following wildfire than harvest. Our review provides temporal benchmarks for gauging recovery times after disturbance. Building upon these temporal benchmarks, and conditioned by disturbance type, site conditions, and location, we present opportunities for using dense time series of remotely sensed data to inform on regional and national trends in forest recovery following disturbance.},

Data Sources Search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, Current Contents, and full-text journal content databases to identify truncated RCTs up to January 2007; search of MEDLINE, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects to identify systematic reviews from which individual RCTs were extracted up to January 2008. Study Selection Selected studies were RCTs reported as having stopped early for benefit and matching nontruncated RCTs from systematic reviews. Independent reviewers with medical content expertise, working blinded to trial results, judged the eligibility of the nontruncated RCTs based on their similarity to the truncated RCTs. Data Extraction Reviewers with methodological expertise conducted data extraction independently. Results The analysis included 91 truncated RCTs asking 63 different questions and 424 matching nontruncated RCTs. The pooled ratio of relative risks in truncated RCTs vs matching nontruncated RCTs was 0.71 (95\% confidence interval, 0.65-0.77). This difference was independent of the presence of a statistical stopping rule and the methodological quality of the studies as assessed by allocation concealment and blinding. Large differences in treatment effect size between truncated and nontruncated RCTs (ratio of relative risks Ͻ0.75) occurred with truncated RCTs having fewer than 500 events. In 39 of the 63 questions (62\%), the pooled effects of the nontruncated RCTs failed to demonstrate significant benefit. Conclusions Truncated RCTs were associated with greater effect sizes than RCTs not stopped early. This difference was independent of the presence of statistical stopping rules and was greatest in smaller studies.},

In the case of the eastern stock of Atlantic bluefin tuna (ABFT), recent changes in management policies have strongly affected the reliability of fishery-dependent indicators due to drastic changes in fishing season/area, fisheries selectivity and strategy. However, fishery-independent indices of abundance are rare for large pelagic fish, and obtaining them is often costly and labor intensive. Here, we show that scientific aerial surveys are an appropriate tool for monitoring juvenile bluefin tuna abundance in the Mediterranean. We present an abundance index based on 62 aerial surveys conducted since 2000, using 2 statistical approaches to deal with the sampling strategy: line and strip transects. Both approaches showed a significant increase in juvenile ABFT abundance in recent years, resulting from the recovery plan established in 2007. Nonetheless, the estimates from the line transect method appear to be more robust and stable. This study provides essential information for fisheries management. Expanding the spatial coverage to other nursery grounds would further increase the reliability and representativeness of this index.},

Using an information theoretic argument we derive a measure PD for the effective number of parameters in a model as the difference between the posterior mean of the deviance and the deviance at the posterior means of the parameters of interest. In general PD approximately corresponds to the trace of the product of Fisher's information and the posterior covariance, which in normal models is the trace of the 'hat' matrix projecting observations onto fitted values. Its properties in exponential families are explored. The posterior mean deviance is suggested as a Bayesian measure of fit or adequacy, and the contributions of individual observations to the fit and complexity can give rise to a diagnostic plot of deviance residuals against leverages. Adding PD to the posterior mean deviance gives a deviance information criterion for comparing models, which is related to other information criteria and has an approximate decision theoretic justification. The procedure is illustrated in some examples, and comparisons are drawn with alternative Bayesian and classical proposals. Throughout it is emphasized that the quantities required are trivial to compute in a Markov chain Monte Carlo analysis.},

Daylight visual surveys achieved 41 detections, estimating density at 14.3 hares km−2 (95\%CI 6.3–32.5) resulting in the lowest estimate and widest confidence interval. Night-time thermal imaging achieved 206 detections, estimating density at 12.1 hares km−2 (95\%CI 7.6–19.4).

Between the methods, detections were spatially correlated, although the estimates of density varied. Our results suggest that daylight visual surveys tended to underestimate density, failing to reflect nocturnal activity. Thermal imaging captured nocturnal activity, providing a higher detection rate, but required fine weather. Camera traps captured nocturnal activity, and operated 24/7 throughout harsh weather, but needed careful consideration of empirical assumptions. We discuss the merits and limitations of each method with respect to the estimation of population density in the field.},

Daylight visual surveys achieved 41 detections, estimating density at 14.3 hares km−2 (95\%CI 6.3–32.5) resulting in the lowest estimate and widest confidence interval. Night-time thermal imaging achieved 206 detections, estimating density at 12.1 hares km−2 (95\%CI 7.6–19.4). Thermal imaging captured more observations at furthest distances, and detected larger group sizes. Camera traps achieved 3705 night-time detections, estimating density at 22.6 hares km−2 (95\%CI 17.1–29.9). Between the methods, detections were spatially correlated, although the estimates of density varied. Our results suggest that daylight visual surveys tended to underestimate density, failing to reflect nocturnal activity. Thermal imaging captured nocturnal activity, providing a higher detection rate, but required fine weather. Camera traps captured nocturnal activity, and operated 24/7 throughout harsh weather, but needed careful consideration of empirical assumptions. We discuss the merits and limitations of each method with respect to the estimation of population density in the field.},

However, uncontrolled roe deer numbers can result in negative impacts on forest regeneration and agricultural crops, disease transmission and occurrences of deer-vehicle collisions. Information on the abundance and distribution is needed for effective management. We combined distance sampling (DS) of roe deer dung pellet groups with multiple variables to develop a density surface model (DSM) in the federal state of Bavaria in south-eastern Germany. We used the estimates of pellet group density as a proxy for roe deer relative abundance. We extrapolated our best DSM, conducted a quantitative evaluation and contrasted relative abundance along climate and land-use gradients. Relative abundance of roe deer was influenced by a combination of habitat type, climate and wildlife management variables, which differed between seasons and which reflected changes in food and shelter availability. At the landscape scale, the highest abundance was observed in agriculture-dominated areas and the lowest in urban areas. Higher abundance was also observed in areas with intermediate temperatures compared to the warmest areas. Our results provide information on possible future changes in the distribution of relative abundance due to changes in climate and land-use.},

  abstract = {Free-ranging domestic cats are a detriment to wildlife and humans by preying on native species and transmitting disease. As a result, removing free-ranging cats from the landscape has become a conservation and public health priority. Estimating cat population size with an unbiased sampling design, however, especially in human-dominated areas, is logistically challenging and rarely done. The lack of robust cat population sampling limits our understanding of where cats pose risks, which is important for evaluating management strategies, such as trap-remove or trap-neuter-return. We hypothesized that cat abundance and activity both depend on human land use and demographics. Using a network of sites participating in a community science program, we conducted transect and camera trap surveys to test predictions of cat population abundance and activity across a gradient of residential land use intensity. Both sampling methods determined that cat abundance was greatest in areas with intermediate human population density and lower educational attainment. Transect data also provided evidence that cat abundance was greatest at intermediate levels of impervious surface cover (e.g., road and buildings), while data from camera traps also showed that cat abundance was positively associated with household income. Using counts of cats observed on cameras, we found that the timing of cat activity varied depending on the degree of urban intensity. Cats were more strictly nocturnal in medium and high intensity residential land-use areas, possibly because a greater proportion of these cats are unowned or because they avoid human activity. These results suggest that transect surveys conducted during the day may undercount cats in urban environments where unowned free-ranging cats predominate. Taken together, our results highlight the importance of incorporating human demographics, land use patterns, and urban context in estimating the abundance of free-ranging cats to better inform management decisions and improve conservation outcomes.},

Despite this rise and the potential of hair samples for ecology and conservation studies, the relative performance of hair collection devices has been rarely tested. Here, we compare the effectiveness of five types of hair traps for brown bears Ursus arctos in the Carpathian Mountains (SE Poland) and test the effects of trap type, season, number of days elapsed since trap installation and trap features on the trapping success in order to provide recommendations for optimal sampling in future studies. The trap types were corral, path-trap, “smola” (beechwood tar) tree-trap, turpentine tree-trap and natural rub. In 2010, we collected 858 hair samples during 2330 inspections of 175 hair traps and found that the most effective traps were smola tree-traps (mean percentage of successful inspections +/- SD: 30.2\% +/- 26.0) and natural rubs (50.8\% +/- 16.7). Based on this finding, over the following 2 years we focused on 24 smola tree-traps and eight natural rubs. During this long-term survey (2010-2012, 969 inspections, 1322 samples collected) the trapping success increased with time and smola tree-traps achieved similar effectiveness to natural rubs (45.5\% +/- 29.7 and 45.9 +/- 23.4, respectively). We show that when baiting smola tree-traps ten weeks prior to research or monitoring, sampling effectiveness can reach up to 30\%. Taking into account the logistical and methodological constraints associated with detecting and using natural rubs for a proper survey design, we recommend using smola tree-traps baited in advance for hair sampling in wildlife studies.}

While much attention has been paid to evaluating the effects of design aspects (size, location, etc.) in achieving reserve objectives, less emphasis has been placed on the role of stakeholder compliance. Therefore, the first aim of this study was to evaluate the state of compliance literature and examine the methods used to measure compliance in reserves. The state of compliance literature is limited, although publications with compliance information have increased sixfold in the last decade. However, most studies containing compliance information (63\%) fail to provide quantitative estimates. Furthermore, most (95\%) quantitative estimates of compliance were reported using a single method, which is problematic because each method has biases and limited applicability. Methods used to indicate compliance include (i) direct observation; (ii) indirect observation; (iii) law enforcement records; (iv) direct questioning; (v) expert opinion; and (vi) modelling. Our second aim was to empirically demonstrate the critical role of compliance in reserve outcomes by comparing a mixed-effects model on compliance data synthesized from 63 marine reserves to that of a null model. The model of best fit demonstrated a negative relationship between non-compliance and target species biomass response ratios. Thus, without incorporating any aspects of reserve design, compliance data predicted reserve response ratios of fish biomass. Accordingly, researchers should explore ways to better understand and measure non-compliance. Therefore, future research should triangulate multiple sources of quantitative compliance data collected using standardized techniques and conduct baseline surveys before reserve implementation.},

  abstract = {1. Sound conservation and management advice usually requires spatial data on animal and plant abundances. The expense of programmes to determine species distributions and estimates of population sizes often limits sample size. To maximise effectiveness at minimal costs, optimisations of such monitoring efforts are critical. A monitoring programme can have multiple objectives with demands on the optimal sampling design that are often in conflict. Here, we develop an optimal sampling design for monitoring programmes with conflicting objectives, building on an existing intertidal benthic monitoring programme in the Dutch Wadden Sea and simulation models bounded in their parameter spaces by these data. 2. We distinguish three possible objectives: (1) estimation of temporal changes and spatial differences in abundance and (2) mapping, that is, prediction of abundances at unsampled locations. Mapping abundances requires model-based analyses using autocorrelation models. Such analyses are as good as the model fits the data; therefore, the final objective was (3) accurately estimating model autocorrelation parameters. To compare sampling designs, we used the following criteria: (1) minimum detectable difference in mean between two time periods or two areas, (2) mean prediction error and (3) estimation bias of autocorrelation parameters. 3. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we compared five sampling designs with respect to these criteria (i.e. simple random, grid, two types of transects, and grid with random replacements) at four levels of naturally occurring spatial autocorrelation. 4. The ideal sampling design for objectives (1) and (2) was grid sampling and for objective (3) random sampling. The sampling design that catered best for all three objectives combined was grid sampling with a number of random samples placed on gridlines. 5. Grid sampling with a number of random samples is considered an accurate and powerful tool with the highest effectiveness. This sampling design is widely applicable and allows for accurate estimates of population sizes, monitoring of population trends, comparisons of populations/trends between years or areas, modelling autocorrelation, mapping species distributions and a mechanistic understanding of species distribution processes.},

  abstract = {Abstract: There has been a dramatic increase in the number of conservation organizations worldwide. It is now common for multiple organizations to operate in the same landscape in pursuit of different conservation goals. New objectives, such as maintenance of ecosystem services, will attract additional funding and new organizations to conservation. Systematic conservation planning helps in the design of spatially explicit management actions that optimally conserve multiple landscape features (e.g., species, ecosystems, or ecosystem services). But the methods used in its application implicitly assume that a single actor implements the optimal plan. We investigated how organizational behavior and conservation outcomes are affected by the presence of autonomous implementing organizations with different objectives. We used simulation models and game theory to explore how alternative behaviors (e.g., organizations acting independently or explicitly cooperating) affected an organization's ability to protect their feature of interest, and investigated how the distribution of features in the landscape influenced organizations’ attitudes toward cooperation. Features with highly correlated spatial distributions, although typically considered an opportunity for mutually beneficial conservation planning, can lead to organizational interactions that result in lower levels of protection. These detrimental outcomes can be avoided by organizations that cooperate when acquiring land. Nevertheless, for cooperative purchases to benefit both organizations’ objectives, each must forgo the protection of land parcels that they would consider to be of high conservation value. Transaction costs incurred during cooperation and the sources of conservation funding could facilitate or hinder cooperative behavior.},

  abstract = {Forests provide an array of services ranging from forest products to greenhouse gas absorption. The reliability and appropriateness of management decisions concerning ecosystem services and resources are directly correlated with the accuracy and extent of the available information on forests and related dynamics. Historically, forest resource management activities informed by decision support systems, have largely relied on field measurements, often with sparse geographical, temporal, and ecological coverage. In contrast, remotely-sensed data can provide dense temporal coverage over large areas. Landsat data in particular have spatial and temporal characteristics well-suited to capturing forest changes on the landscape. Since 2008 free and open access to analysis-ready data representing more than 40 years of data in the Landsat archive has created new opportunities for forest monitoring. There is however, a need to link forest information generated from remotely-sensed data to the data input needs of decision support systems. Here, we develop such a linkage between field and remotely-sensed observations to characterize one of the main drivers of forest change: growth. The goal of this research is to produce above-ground biomass (AGB) change estimates that integrate the information of re-measured field plots and that of the Landsat time series. Over a large test area (\$3.3 Mha) in Saskatchewan, Canada, we demonstrate how information from a dense Landsat time series (1984–2012) can be used with a network of field plots to estimate change in AGB over the broad geographical, temporal, and ecological range of these forests. Our approach expands forest growth estimation both spatially and temporally, and results in information layers that are directly ingestible in decision support models. Our results show that trends match between the field plots and the remote-sensing-field-combined estimate, but that the more encompassing spatial estimates give more varied and lower average estimates of AGB change for our study region. We hypothesize that integrating both remotely-sensed information and repeated field measurements covers a wider range of ecological conditions, forest productivity, and forest developmental stages present on the landscape and through time than the field plots alone. The next step in our research is to integrate our findings into the forest resource management decision support tools, with the aim of increasingly spatializing what are usually spatially-referenced models. Our findings highlight emergent synergies between complementary data sources that foster the generation of new information products for forest resources management decision support.},

  abstract = {Homer S. Swingle was a pioneer in pond management and professor of fisheries at Auburn University. Results from his scientific research on the principles of fish interactions in lakes and ponds, and methods to improve fish production are used worldwide, and he is credited with improving lives of countless people by increasing the amount of food available to those in developing countries and providing recreational opportunities to a multitude of anglers. His advice was sought by US presidents, prime ministers, the United Nations and countries across the globe (Byrd 1973). His biological work was groundbreaking, yet there is little evidence that Homer Swingle used sampling procedures when conducting his work. His major works contain no reports of sampling error with his estimates (Swingle 1950, 1952) and his contemporaries have pointed out that he actively avoided subsampling in favor of census. His methods for enumerating a population were simple. At the conclusion of his pond experiments, he would census every fish involved, either by draining or treating the pond with piscicide (fish poison). Being a student on Swingle’s piscicide crew meant counting every dead fish as it floated to the water’s surface in the hot Alabama sun over a 3-day period. Those involved in the third-day pickup were the unluckiest, and often the least senior members of the crew—a smelly task indeed! While a complete census of all experimental or survey subjects provides the most complete information, few of us have the luxury of counting every subject in a population to estimate population characteristics. It simply costs too much, takes too much time, or is infeasible in some other way. Therefore we have to sample a portion of the population to estimate diversity or population parameters such as abundance. For example, a marine biologist estimating the number of clams in the Gulf of California cannot hope to count every one—he will expand an estimate calculated from a sample of plots. A plant biologist measuring the biomass of grasses in a field will not weigh every grass blade in the field—she will estimate the biomass through a sample of plots containing grass. A wildlife biologist will not count all mice in a national park to determine relative density of different species. Density will be determined by a subset of captures from different areas. To ensure the most useful information, a biologist must be familiar with basic sampling issues. Here we discuss some issues that all biologists should know when sampling diversity, abundance, or other parameters. Consideration of these issues allows the biologist to sample in a manner that, while not a perfect reflection of the population, will provide the best representation of the true population as possible.},

  abstract = {Management of an invasive plant species can be viewed as two separate and successive processes. The first, survey, aims to find infested areas and remove individuals. The second, monitoring, consists of repeated visits to these areas in order to prevent possible re-emergence. As detection probability may vary over time, the timing and number of monitoring visits can dramatically impact monitoring efficacy. We explore the optimal timing and number of monitoring visits, by focusing on one infested site. Our decision-analysis framework defines an optimal monitoring schedule which accounts for a time-dependent probability of detection, based on the presence/ absence of a flower. We use this framework to investigate the optimal monitoring schedule for Hieracium aurantiacum, an invasive species in the Australian Alps and many other countries. We also perform a sensitivity analysis to draw more general conclusions. For H. aurantiacum eight monitoring visits (compared to 12 visits in the current program) are sufficient to obtain a 99\% monitoring efficacy. When four or fewer visits to a site are allowed, it is optimal to visit during the high season, when the weed is likely to initiate flowering. Any extra visits should be scheduled in the early season, before the plants flower. The sensitivity analysis shows that increasing the detection probability early in the season has a greater impact than increasing it late in the season. An effective treatment method increases the value of site visits late in the season, when the detection probability is higher. Our decision-analysis framework can assist invasive species managers to reduce or reallocate management resources by determining the minimum number of monitoring visits required to satisfy an acceptable risk of re-emergence.},

These can have substantial impact on the bias and precision of distance sampling estimators. In this paper we develop methods that accommodate both systematic and stochastic measurement errors. We use the methods to estimate detection probability in two surveys with substantial measurement error. The first is a shipboard line transect survey in the North Sea in which information on measurement error comes from photographically measured distances to a subset of detections. The second is an aerial cue-counting survey off Iceland in which information on measurement error comes from pairs of independently estimated distances to a subset of detections. Different methods are required for measurement error estimation in the two cases. We investigate by simulation the properties of the new estimators and compare them to conventional estimators. They are found to perform better than conventional estimators in the presence of measurement error, more so in the case of cue-counting and point transect estimators than line transect estimators. An appendix on the asymptotic distributions of conditional and full likelihood estimators is available online.},

  abstract = {Autonomous sensors and automated analysis have great potential to reduce cost and increase efficacy of wildlife monitoring. By increasing sampling effort, autonomous sensors are powerful at detecting rare and elusive species such as the marbled murrelet (Brachyramphus marmoratus). New approaches must be tested for comparability to existing methodologies, so we compared the results of inland audio-visual and of automated acoustic monitoring for marbled murrelets, conducted during the 2010 breeding season, at 7 sites in the Santa Cruz Mountains, California, USA. We found automated acoustic surveys and analysis had fewer detections per morning compared with audio-visual surveyors, but the rate of automated acoustic detections per morning was positively and strongly correlated with the rate of audio-visual detections per mornings (r = 0.96, P {$<$} 0.01). Furthermore, acoustic monitoring sampled 10 times more mornings per site ({$<$}(x)over bar{$>$} = 48) than were monitored by human surveyors ((x) over bar = 4.4) at a comparable cost. We used resampling to estimate the power to detect murrelet presence with acoustic sensors at {$>$}80\% within 8 continuous days of recordings, even at low-activity sites. Our results suggest that autonomous sensor and automated analysis approaches could greatly increase the scale and efficacy of murrelet monitoring, allowing for more cost-effective surveying of large and remote areas of potential habitat, as well as, improved ability to measure changes in inland activity. Further study of passive acoustic recordings would be valuable to examine for acoustic signs of breeding phenology, and site occupancy, if acoustic surveys are to replace the utility of audio-visual surveys.

  abstract = {Red wood ants are ecologically important members of woodland communities, and some species are of conservation concern. They occur commonly only in certain habitats in Britain, but there is limited knowledge of their numbers and distribution. This study provided baseline information at a key locality (Abernethy Forest, 37 km(2)) in the central Highlands of Scotland and trialed a new method of surveying red wood ant density and stand type associations: a distance sampling line transect survey of nests. This method is efficient because it allows an observer to quickly survey a large area. either side of transect lines, without having to assume that all nests are detected. Instead, data collected on the distance of nests from the line are used to estimate probability of detection and the effective transect width, using the free software "Distance". Surveys took place in August and September 2003 along a total of 71.2 km of parallel, equally-spaced transects. One hundred and forty-four red wood ant nests were located, comprising 89 F. aquilonia (Yarrow, 1955) and 55 F. lugubris (Zetterstedt, 1838) nests. Estimated densities were 1.13 nests per hectare (95\% CI 0.74-1.73) for F. aquilonia and 0.83 nests per hectare (95\% CI 0.32-2.17) for F. lugubris. These translated to total estimated nest numbers of 4,200 (95\% CI 2,700-6,400) and 3,100 (95\% CI 1,200-8,100), respectively, for the whole forest. Indices of stand selection indicated that F. aquilonia had some positive association with old-growth and F. lugubris with younger stands (stem exclusion stage). No nests were found in areas that had been clear-felled, and ploughed and planted in the 1970s-1990s. The pattern of stand type association and hence distribution of F. aquilonia and F. lugubris may be due to the differing ability to disperse (F. lugubris is the faster disperser) and compete (F. aquilonia is competitively superior). We recommend using line transect sampling for extensive surveys of ants that construct nest mounds to estimate abundance and stand type association.},

  abstract = {[Aim: I detail several problems and solutions related to estimating pre-settlement forest density from land surveyors' bearing tree data. The data have a high value, so clarification of existing problems is needed in the development of a better theoretical framework in which to treat them. I focus on absolute density because it is the foundation for several other variables, e.g. basal area, timber volume and carbon content. Location: The issues raised are relevant to the vast area encompassed by rectangular land surveys, including the General Land Office survey area of the United States (roughly, Ohio and Florida to the Pacific coast and Alaska), as well as significant areas in the eastern United States, and possibly elsewhere. Methods: A literature review details the history and nature of density estimation from bearing tree data, and spatial simulations quantify the effects of certain identified problems on density estimates. The review focuses on methodological issues appearing in the ecological and biometrical literature. Results: Problems encountered in the literature and addressed here include: (1) aggregated tree spatial patterns and their effect on density using traditional estimators; (2) the mis-designation of bearing tree labels in relation to definitions given in the estimators; (3) biases due to small sample size; and (4) surveyor-induced biases. Simulations of aggregated tree populations having a 44-fold density variation show that estimates ranging from 5 to 127 per cent of actual can result, depending on the estimator used, the scale at which it is calculated, and the error in tree distance rank assignments. The traditionally used estimator is accurate only when trees are spatially random throughout, and sample size is not small. More robust estimators exist that can accommodate a wider range of variation in spatial pattern, sampling design and sample size. One of these is discussed in detail. Main conclusions: Data users should pay much closer attention to critical aspects of bearing tree data and analytical methods, provide basic but necessary descriptive data, and more accurately represent the inherent range of possible errors of estimate. They can narrow this range of uncertainty by using the methods and considerations discussed here and in other recent work.]},

We develop estimators that allow correlated quadrat abundance estimates, even for quadrats in different sampling strata. Correlated quadrat abundance estimates based on mark-recapture or distance sampling methods occur when data are pooled across quadrats to estimate, for example, capture probability parameters or sighting functions. When only minimal information is available from each quadrat, pooling of data across quadrats may be necessary to efficiently estimate capture probabilities or sighting functions. We further include information from a quadrat-based auxiliary variable to more precisely estimate total population size via a ratio estimator. We also provide variance estimators for the difference between or the ratio of 2 abundance estimates, taken at different times. We present an example based on estimating the number of Mexican spotted owls (Strix occidentalis lucida) in the Upper Gila Mountains Recovery Unit, Arizona and, New Mexico, USA. Owl abundance for each quadrat was estimated with a Huggins 4-pass mark-resight population estimator, but with initial capture and resighting probabilities modeled in common across all sample quadrats. Pooling mark-resight data across quadrats was necessary because few owls were marked on individual quadrats to estimate quadrat-specific capture probabilities. Model-based estimates of owl abundance for each quadrat necessitated variance estimation procedures that take into account correlated quadrat estimates. An auxiliary variable relating to topographic roughness of sampled quadrats provided a useful covariate for a ratio estimator.},

However, this is often challenging for cetaceans as surveys typically cover only a portion of a population’s range and conventional stock assessment methods cannot then distinguish whether apparent changes in abundance reflect real changes in population size or shifts in distribution. We developed and tested methods for estimating population size and trend and detecting changes in population trend in the context of shifting habitat by integrating additional data into distance-sampling analysis. Previous research has shown that incorporating habitat information can improve population size estimates for highly mobile species with dynamic spatial distributions. Here, using simulated datasets representative of a large whale population, we demonstrate that incorporating individual mark-recapture data can increase the accuracy and precision of trend estimation and the power to distinguish whether apparent changes in abundance reflect changes in population trend or distribution shifts. We recommend that similar simulation studies are conducted for specific cetacean populations to assess the potential for detecting changes in population dynamics given available data. This approach is especially important wherever population change may be confounded with long-term change in distribution patterns associated with regime shifts or climate change.},

Unfortunately, there exist few general guidelines to help practitioners design monitoring programs that reach this balance. Here, we analyse a 33-year monitoring program from Ghana, West Africa, to provide both specific and general suggestions for monitoring in developing countries. Since the late 1960s the Ghana Wildlife Division has monitored more than 40 wildlife species with monthly surveys at sites throughout Ghana's nature reserves. These data present unparalleled opportunities to illuminate the scale and pattern of changes in animal abundance over time and the forces that drive these changes. We used sub-sampling of the Ghana monitoring data for four species in two savanna reserves to identify the minimum level of monitoring necessary to reliably detect changes in wildlife populations over 5-year intervals. We used a similar approach to estimate the minimum sampling needed to infer changes in abundance of hunters in reserves. Our results highlight the relative importance of comprehensive spatial and temporal sampling and suggest a requirement of no less than one monitoring site per every 285 km(2) in large reserves and 65 km(2) in smaller reserves. We discuss briefly the cost of effective monitoring and the relevance of our results to other regions of Africa and the world.},

To inform future conservation measures for this poorly known species, we used ecological niche factor analysis, habitat suitability modelling and distance sampling to determine landscape-scale habitat requirements and estimate the population size. Using GIS software, we integrated digital layers of ecogeographic variables with; (1) presence-only observations to derive and validate a habitat suitability model using ecological niche factor analysis, and (2) distance sampling to determine population distribution and densities across vegetation types. We detected populations in only five of seven reserves which they had occupied in 2000. We estimate the global population size to be 16,821 individuals (range 8431–39, 104), 68\% greater than the previously estimated 10,000 individuals, with a single large reserve containing the majority (∼92\%) of the global population. The Mallee Emu-wren is a habitat specialist, primarily occurring in mallee-Triodia vegetation that has not been burnt for at least 15 years. The highest densities were in vegetation associations containing at least a 15\% cover of Triodia, however, time since the habitat was last burnt was the overriding factor in determining densities. Large-scale wildfires are a pervasive threat to the global status of the Mallee Emu-wren, and the risk to remaining populations is exacerbated by the adverse impact of prolonged drought and the potential for altered fire regimes caused by global warming. Evaluation of the global population status, and the continued wildfire threat warranted recent reclassification of the Mallee Emu-wren from Vulnerable to Endangered according to IUCN Red List categories and criteria.},

Both regulators and other major stakeholders are directly incorporated into the approach to enhance decision-making processes. We call this approach trade-off analysis. The approach uses a framework based on multi-criteria analysis (MCA) but involves stakeholders at all stages. This holistic approach is appropriate for multiple use, complex systems such as marine protected areas (MPAs), where many different users are apparently in conflict and where linkages and feedbacks between different aspects of the ecosystem and economy exist. The paper applies trade-off analysis to the case of Buccoo Reef Marine Park (BRMP) in Tobago. Stakeholder analysis is undertaken, and social, economic and ecological criteria identified. The impacts of four different development scenarios are evaluated for these criteria. Stakeholders are asked to weight different criteria and then the outcomes of different stakeholder weightings in the MCA are used to explore different management options. For BRMP, the MCA suggests consensus around development options characterised as limited tourism development for the area surrounding the park in association with the implementation of complementary environmental management. The approach has been used to enhance stakeholder involvement in decision-making and develop consensus-based approaches to management of the MPA. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. Ail rights reserved.},

  abstract = {The point-centered-quarter (PCQ) method has been applied in community analysis since the publication of the method nearly 50 years ago. This and other distance methods offer increased sampling efficiency over fixed-area plots (FA-P), but have long been known to produce biased density estimates when plant distribution deviates from random spatial patterns. Spatial indices have been developed to quantify the direction of this bias when plant distributions are aggregated or evenly distributed. Its continued use, especially in community analysis, requires additional scrutiny in measurements of community structure. We measured 14 forest stands of varying age, elevation and disturbance regime using FA-P and PCQ methods. Density estimates were biased, with the point-centered quarter method lower than fixed-area plot estimates when stems were aggregated and higher when stems were evenly spaced. In general the PCQ method underestimated species richness. The efficiency of the PCQ method makes it popular for ordination studies, although comparison of community structure varied from 18\% to 90\% similarity between the measurements of species basal area in the same stands using the two different methods. The bias observed in calculations of stem density, species abundance and community similarity indicate that use of the PCQ method should be approached with caution when used in community level analysis.},

It addresses new methodologies, new technologies and recent developments in statistical theory and is the follow up companion to Introduction to Distance Sampling (OUP, 2001). In this text, a general theoretical basis is established for methods of estimating animal abundance from sightings surveys, and a wide range of approaches to analysis of sightings data is explored. These approaches include: modelling animal detectability as a function of covariates, where the effects of habitat, observer, weather, etc. on detectability can be assessed; estimating animal density as a function of location, allowing for example animal density to be related to habitat and other locational covariates; estimating change over time in populations, a necessary aspect of any monitoring programme; estimation when detection of animals on the line or at the point is uncertain, as often occurs for marine populations, or when the survey region has dense cover; survey design and automated design algorithms, allowing rapid generation of sound survey designs using geographic information systems; adaptive distance sampling methods, which concentrate survey effort in areas of high animal density; passive distance sampling methods, which extend the application of distance sampling to species that cannot be readily detected in sightings surveys, but can be trapped; and testing of methods by simulation, so that performance of the approach in varying circumstances can be assessed. Authored by a leading team this text is aimed at professionals in government and environment agencies, statisticians, biologists, wildlife managers, conservation biologists and ecologists, as well as graduate students, studying the density and abundance of biological populations.},

For example, large-scale offshore wind farms are proposed for UK waters, and surveys are currently being conducted to quantify numbers and distribution ahead of construction. 2. Technological advances mean that strip transect surveys may now be conducted, using digital methods. We address survey design and data analysis issues for such digital surveys, contrasting them with visual aerial line transect surveys. 3. We also explore the relative performances of the methods for estimating the size of a large aggregation of common scoters in Carmarthen Bay, Wales. We found that abundance estimates from two digital methods were closely comparable, while estimates from visual aerial surveys were appreciably lower. 4. Synthesis and applications. Efficient survey methods to quantify abundance and distribution of seabirds are needed, to assess change arising from climate change, or developments such as the construction of large-scale offshore wind farms. The traditional survey methods are visual surveys conducted along transects from ships or aircraft. Digital video and stills surveys can be conducted from aircraft flying sufficiently high to avoid disturbance, while still being able to detect and identify seabirds. Given the rapid technological developments, we expect digital surveys largely to replace visual surveys for seabirds in offshore regions.},

This is the fourth book dedicated to distance sampling. In the decade since the last book published, there have been a number of new developments. The intervening years have also shown which advances are of most use. This self-contained book covers topics from the previous publications, while also including recent developments in method, software and application.Distance sampling refers to a suite of methods, including line and point transect sampling, in which animal density or abundance is estimated from a sample of distances to detected individuals. The book illustrates these methods through case studies; data sets and computer code are supplied to readers through the book’s accompanying website. Some of the case studies use the software Distance, while others use R code. The book is in three parts. The first part addresses basic methods, the design of surveys, distance sampling experiments, field methods and data issues. The second part develops a range of modelling approaches for distance sampling data. The third part describes variations in the basic method; discusses special issues that arise when sampling different taxa (songbirds, seabirds, cetaceans, primates, ungulates, butterflies, and plants); considers advances to deal with failures of the key assumptions; and provides a check-list for those conducting surveys.},

  abstract = {This book introduces the suite of techniques known as 'distance sampling', so-called because the common theme is the sampling of distances of objects from a line or point. The objects are usually animals or groups of animals ('clusters'), and the primary aim is to estimate their density or abundance in a survey area. In line transect sampling, the sampled distances are the shortest or perpendicular distance from a detected object to the line. It is the most widely used method for assessing the abundance of a wide range of terrestrial and marine animals. In point transect sampling, distances of detected objects from the sampled points are recorded. This book provides a comprehensive introduction to both techniques, and also describes several related techniques.'Introduction to Distance Sampling' updates the 1993 book 'Distance Sampling', which was the first, and until now, only book devoted to the topic. The book is aimed at quantitative biologists and wildlife managers, and statisticians involved in wildlife monitoring programmes. Of particular significance in this update is the chapter on study design and field methods, which has been extensively rewritten and extended. New technologies such as laser range finders, theodolites and the Geographical Positioning System (GPS) are discussed, and advice is given on a wide range of survey methods. Analysis methods have also been generalized, through the use of various types of multiplier. Many exercises have been introduced, to make the book more useful to graduate students in wildlife and conservation management.},

Researchers commonly use animal-to-observer distances (AODs) in analysis, in preference to perpendicular distances from the line, which is in marked contrast with standard practice for other applications of line transect sampling. We formalize the mathematical shortcomings of approaches based on AODs, and show that they are likely to give strongly biased estimates of density. We review papers that claim good performance for the method, and explore this performance through simulations. These confirm strong bias in estimates of density using AODs. We conclude that AOD methods are conceptually flawed, and that they cannot in general provide valid estimates of density.},

We address some of the technical issues underlying composite indices, including survey design, weighting of the constituent indices, identification of change-points and estimation of spatially varying time trends. We suggest some criteria that biodiversity measures for use in monitoring surveys should satisfy, and we discuss the problems of implementing rigorous methods.

Monitoring programs provide the information to assess the state of conservation resources, the severity of threats and the success of management responses. Here we compare the management priorities, monitoring priorities and actual monitoring practices of protected area management agencies in Australia, using four sets of data at continental scale and five at a more restricted regional scale. We track changes over a period of several years and focus at successively finer levels of detail. At both continental and regional scales, most management plans emphasise fire, invasive species and visitor management; and most monitoring programmes refer to visitor numbers and impacts as well as species and ecosystems. There is only a weak match, however, between reported management priorities and actual monitoring programmes; and the effectiveness of management responses is rarely monitored. The level of detail in visitor monitor programmes varies considerably: most parks count visitors, but few know what those visitors do. Threats from fire and invasive species receive more attention that those from recreation. At regional scale, the proportion of parks with defined monitoring programmes and priorities increased significantly from 2003/2004 to 2006/2007. Whilst only a proportion of protected areas monitor endangered species populations, for those that do this is the parameter reported in most detail, with many parks reporting single records of single individuals. Some parks also maintain anecdotal records of rare species outside routine monitoring programs.},

Baseline data collected during 1989-1995 are compared with data from a synthesis of recently published papers and reports and new field work carried out across the region during 2010-2014. We show that biodiversity endemism values are largely unchanged, although two new species (amphibian and mammal) have been named and two extremely rare tree species have been relocated. However, forest habitat continues to be lost and degraded, largely as a result of agricultural expansion, charcoal production to supply cities with cooking fuel, logging for timber and cutting of wood for firewood and building poles. Habitat loss is linked to an increase in the number of species threatened over time. The government-managed forest reserve network has expanded slightly but has low effectiveness. Three forest reserves have been upgraded to National Parks and Nature Reserves, which have stricter protection and more effective enforcement. There has also been rapid development of village-owned forest reserves, with more than 14o now existing; although usually small, they are an important addition to the areas being managed for sustainable resource use, and also provide tangible benefits to local people. Human-use pressures remain intense in many areas, and combined with emerging pressures from mining, gas and oil exploration, many endemic species remain threatened with extinction.},

  abstract = {Aim As populations decline they become harder to detect simply because there are fewer animals to observe. In such cases, survey effort that was once reliable may become inadequate and the species incorrectly labelled locally extinct, causing management efforts to cease. For declining populations, then, we need to determine the survey effort necessary to detect the species, assuming only a single individual is present at a site. Detectability, however, often varies wildly with seasonal, behavioural and environmental variables. Thus, we need statistical analyses and survey design which can deal with highly variable detection rates and allow us to detect even very small populations. This is especially true in Australia, where many mammal species are experiencing serious decline. Here, we examine a threatened Australian rodent, the New Holland Mouse (Pseudomys novaehollandiae): we determine minimum survey requirements for reliable detection and show that historical survey effort is inadequate to assert local extinction. Location Victoria, Australia. Methods Using a 48-year live-trapping dataset, we estimated P. novaehollandiae abundance and detectability using N-mixture modelling in a Bayesian framework, testing the effects of seasonal fluctuations and environmental variables to determine ideal conditions for occupancy surveys. We used these findings to assess the adequacy of historical resurvey efforts in confirming local extinctions. Results We found that detectability followed seasonal fluctuations distinct from changes in abundance, was strongly reduced by brighter moon phases, and slightly increased over the course of a survey and when raining. When abundance was low, standard historical survey efforts were inadequate to assert the species' absence with appropriate statistical confidence, indicating that further surveys would be required to test purported local extinctions. Main conclusions Our results highlight the potential for considerable intra-species heterogeneity in detectability caused by shifting local abundances and survey conditions, as well as the importance of accounting for detectability when monitoring threatened and declining species.},

Poorer countries have the largest relative shortfalls. Such extensive and rapid expansion of formal PAs is unlikely to be achievable.

  abstract = {Many farmland bird populations are declining, and their negative trends are often associated with changes in land-use or farming practices, including the use of agrochemicals. The red-legged partridge (RLP) is a Mediterranean farmland game species of high socio-economic importance whose populations are thought to have declined sharply since the mid-20th century associated with farmland changes. However, no large-scale studies have tested whether abundance or trends of RLP are related to farmland composition or management. We used hierarchical distance sampling models to estimate RLP abundance in 2010 in central Spain (Castilla-La Mancha), a main European population stronghold of this species. We studied associations between RLP density and land-uses (including variation in management: irrigated crops or organic farming). We also assessed regional abundance variation over seven years (2010-2017) and its relationship with changes in land-use. Our results show that RLP abundance increased with the availability of natural vegetation and traditional rain-fed vineyards, but decreased with increasing proportions of tree crops and irrigated vineyards; the latter association was less pronounced in areas sensitive to nitrate contamination in water, where the amount of fertilizers applied in farmland and use of certain farming practices is more strictly regulated. These results support the idea that increases in intensive vineyards are detrimental to the RLP. We also report a strong population decline of RLP in the region, with a 51\% abundance reduction in seven years. This decline was steeper in areas where more natural vegetation had been lost and where ecological tree crops had increased. Overall, our results indicate that changes in land-use (type of crop, or the destruction of natural vegetation in farmland) and farming practices (e.g. use of irrigation in certain crops, use of nitrates) have important impacts on this farmland bird, affecting both spatial distribution and population dynamics.

  abstract = {Understanding the age structure of vegetation is important for effective land management, especially in fire-prone landscapes where the effects of fire can persist for decades and centuries. In many parts of the world, such information is limited due to an inability to map disturbance histories before the availability of satellite images (\textasciitilde 1972). Here, we describe a method for creating a spatial model of the age structure of canopy species that established pre-1972. We built predictive neural network models based on remotely sensed data and ecological field survey data. These models determined the relationship between sites of known fire age and remotely sensed data. The predictive model was applied across a 104,000 km2 study region in semi-arid Australia to create a spatial model of vegetation age structure, which is primarily the result of stand-replacing fires which occurred before 1972. An assessment of the predictive capacity of the model using independent validation data showed a significant correlation (rs = 0.64) between predicted and known age at test sites. Application of the model provides valuable insights into the distribution of vegetation ageclasses and fire history in the study region. This is a relatively straightforward method which uses widely available data sources that can be applied in other regions to predict age-class distribution beyond the limits imposed by satellite imagery.},

Sampling methods were designed to resemble those used in similar surveys of 1-km2 sites in tropical rainforests in Cameroon and Sabah. A total of 27 species were recorded for the site. Slugs and a semi-slug were found only in the 2002 survey. Individual plots were very similar in species richness and composition; the richest plot contained about 85\% of the fauna recorded for the whole site. Overall densities were very high. This local homogeneity contrasts with marked heterogeneity over Crete as a whole. These results are contrasted with those from tropical forests, where individual plots vary considerably in richness and composition, where densities are lower and where the total site faunas are larger. Although there are problems associated with differing amounts of sampling error between studies, this contrast is striking and some possible causes are discussed. Further work in tropical forest on limestone may elucidate this.},

  abstract = {Applied ecologists continually advocate further research, under the assumption that obtaining more information will lead to better decisions. Value of information (VoI) analysis can be used to quantify how additional information may improve management outcomes: despite its potential, this method is still underused in environmental decision-making. We provide a primer on how to calculate the VoI and assess whether reducing uncertainty will change a decision. Our aim is to facilitate the application of VoI by managers who are not familiar with decision-analytic principles and notation, by increasing the technical accessibility of the tool. Calculating the VoI requires explicit formulation of management objectives and actions. Uncertainty must be clearly structured and its effects on management outcomes evaluated. We present two measures of the VoI. The expected value of perfect information is a calculation of the expected improvement in management outcomes that would result from access to perfect knowledge. The expected value of sample information calculates the improvement in outcomes expected by collecting a given sample of new data. We guide readers through the calculation of VoI using two case studies: (i) testing for disease when managing a frog species and (ii) learning about demographic rates for the reintroduction of an endangered turtle. We illustrate the use of Bayesian updating to incorporate new information. The VoI depends on our current knowledge, the quality of the information collected and the expected outcomes of the available management actions. Collecting information can require significant investments of resources; VoI analysis assists managers in deciding whether these investments are justified.},

However, information extraction by per pixel multispectral classification techniques proves to be very complex owing to the internal variability increase in land-cover units and to the weakness of spectral resolution. Image segmentation before classification was proposed as an alternative approach, but a large variety of segmentation algorithms were developed during the last 20 years, and a comparison of their implementation on very high spatial resolution images is necessary. In this study, four algorithms from the two main groups of segmentation algorithms (boundarybased and region-based) were evaluated and compared. In order to compare the algorithms, an evaluation of each algorithm was carried out with empirical discrepancy evaluation methods. This evaluation is carried out with a visual segmentation of Ikonos panchromatic images. The results show that the choice of parameters is very important and has a great influence on the segmentation results. The selected boundary-based algorithms are sensitive to the noise or texture. Better results are obtained with regionbased algorithms, but a problem with the transition zones between the contrasted objects can be present.},

To try to reduce the time, effort, and financial costs of monitoring large mammals, I examine a 20-year dataset of herbivore records taken from vehicle transects carried out in Katavi National Park, western Tanzania. I find that: (i) population trends obtained from ground transects are similar to those obtained from aerial surveys conducted over a wider area; (ii) the frequency of vehicle surveys driven per year or (iii) across years can be reduced without losing substantial information; (iv) it is inadvisable to stint on numbers of transects driven; and (v) trends in populations of single species do not represent those of others. These findings are encouraging because they indicate that managers can obtain relatively accurate information about herbivore population trends through infrequent and therefore more cost-effective monitoring.},

  abstract = {Knowledge about how hunting pressure is determined, and the relative efficacy of different mechanisms to regulate harvest, can help to improve the managers' decision-making process. We developed a general framework about the decision-making process that regulates redlegged partridge (Alectoris rufa) hunting pressure in central Spain based on information from a focus group and individual interviews with game managers. We also used available information to compare the efficiency of different tools thus improving some decision steps. We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of different population monitoring methods as a way to reduce uncertainty on partridge availability to hunters. Additionally, we investigated the relationship between annual harvest and various regulatory mechanisms of partridge hunting pressure used in the study area to identify the most potentially useful one to limit annual take-off. Game managers usually set hunting pressure after a qualitative assessment on population abundance prior to the hunting season, but this decision was frequently modified during the course of the hunting season according to variations in catch or perceived abundance at that time. Our results showed that kilometric abundance indices (counting partridges from cars along line transects) was a simple cost-efficient and reliable estimate of partridge density (estimated by Distance sampling). A variety of regulatory mechanisms were used by managers. The variables that most affected annual harvest (in addition to partridge abundance) were the number of driven-shooting days, and hunter density in walked-up hunting days, suggesting that their adjustment will be the most efficient regulatory mechanisms. We conclude that adequate monitoring on population abundance should be a critical step for managers' decision-making, and that a better understanding of the relative value of regulatory mechanisms, combining social and ecological approaches, would help improving our understanding of any human-mediated system, thus leading to better management recommendations.},

  abstract = {Understanding species distribution is central to ecology, evolution and wildlife conservation. However, detecting species presence in the field may be challenging, especially for scarce, elusive and wide-ranging animals such as mammalian carnivores. Here we undertook a large-scale methodological study to assess scat sampling effort required to detect five mesocarnivore species in a Spanish Mediterranean area. Our goals were to: (1) evaluate the optimal effort (i.e. transect length) needed to detect scats of each species; and (2) examine if this sampling effort depends on environmental factors. First, we constructed "curves of first detection" for each carnivore species and evaluated the most cost-effective sampling effort. Second, we used Generalized Linear Mixed Models (GLMMs) to relate the transect length to first detection of each species in each positive transect to a comprehensive set of environmental variables. Our results suggested that sampling effort in this study, namely the transect length needed to detect a given species, can be substantially shortened for two species (red fox and stone marten) with a relatively low reduction in the information on their presence. The most efficient scenario corresponded to a transect length of 1.5 km, where red foxes and stone martens would be detected in 72.95 and 65.43\% of the positive transects, respectively. However, different sampling approaches would be advisable for the remaining species. We also found that the sampling effort was weakly affected by environmental constraints. Our study may contribute to the design of more efficient scat-based carnivore sampling methodologies elsewhere. In particular, we propose that our results can be successfully extrapolated to other areas of the Iberian Peninsula with close abundances of the species considered and similar environmental characteristics.

The reference population abundance in each habitat was calculated through an intensive capture, colour-banding, and resighting effort. Line transects consistently produced unbiased estimates of density for both sites at two time periods (morning and afternoon), and proved to be the most efficient of the distance sampling methods tested. Point-transect methods proved to be biased in this instance, consistently producing overestimates of density for this species, and were unreliable as indices of the small differences in density between habitats. Transect counts conducted from established walking tracks underestimated both density and the variance of estimated density. We conclude that in situations requiring estimates of absolute density for North Island saddleback, a series of randomly positioned line transects will accurately represent the density of individuals. Furthermore, this study highlights the need to pilot distance survey techniques on the species of interest to detect possible violation of the assumptions underlying these methods. We question the widespread use of point-transect counts for censusing avian species without such preliminary investigation, and recommend further comparisons of distance sampling methods in New Zealand with reference populations where opportunity provides.},

In our view, intensifying enforcement effort is crucial, but will ultimately prove an inadequate long-term strategy with which to conserve high-value species. This is because: regulatory approaches are being overwhelmed by the drivers of poaching and trade, financial incentives for poaching are increasing due to rising prices and growing relative poverty between areas of supply and centers of demand, and aggressive enforcement of trade controls, in particular bans, can increase profits and lead to the involvement of organized criminals with the capacity to operate even under increased enforcement effort. With prices for high-value wildlife rising, we argue that interventions need to go beyond regulation and that new and bold strategies are needed urgently. In the immediate future, we should incentivize and build capacity within local communities to conserve wildlife. In the medium term, we should drive prices down by reexamining sustainable off-take mechanisms such as regulated trade, ranching and wildlife farming, using economic levers such as taxation to fund conservation efforts, and in the long-term reduce demand through social marketing programs.},

  abstract = {The development and use of automated species detection technologies, such as acoustic recorders, for monitoring wildlife are rapidly expanding. Automated classification algorithms provide cost- and time-effective means to process information-rich data, but often at the cost of additional detection errors. Appropriate methods are necessary to analyse such data while dealing with the different types of detection errors. We developed a hierarchical modelling framework for estimating species occupancy from automated species detection data. We explore design and optimization of data post-processing procedures to account for detection errors and generate accurate estimates. Our proposed method accounts for both imperfect detection and false-positive errors and utilizes information about both occurrence and abundance of detections to improve estimation. Using simulations, we show that our method provides much more accurate estimates than models ignoring the abundance of detections. The same findings are reached when we apply the methods to two real datasets on North American frogs surveyed with acoustic recorders. When false positives occur, estimator accuracy can be improved when a subset of detections produced by the classification algorithm is post-validated by a human observer. We use simulations to investigate the relationship between accuracy and effort spent on post-validation, and found that very accurate occupancy estimates can be obtained with as little as 1\% of data being validated. Automated monitoring of wildlife provides opportunity and challenges. Our methods for analysing automated species detection data help to meet key challenges unique to these data and will prove useful for many wildlife monitoring programmes.},

The likely impacts of climate change on the frequency and intensity of wildfire highlights the importance of understanding how fire-induced heterogeneity may affect different components of the biota. Here, we examine the influence of wildfire, as an agent of landscape heterogeneity, on the distribution of arboreal mammals in fire-prone forests in south-eastern Australia. First, we used a stratified design to examine the role of topography, and the relative influence of fire severity and fire history, on the occurrence of arboreal mammals 2-3 years after wildfire. Second, we investigated the influence of landscape context on the occurrence of arboreal mammals at severely burnt sites. Forested gullies supported a higher abundance of arboreal mammals than slopes. Fire severity was the strongest influence, with abundance lower at severely burnt than unburnt sites. The occurrence of mammals at severely burned sites was influenced by landscape context: abundance increased with increasing amount of unburnt and understorey-only burnt forest within a 1 km radius. These results support the hypothesis that unburnt forest and moist gullies can serve as refuges for fauna in the post-fire environment and assist recolonization of severely burned forest. They highlight the importance of spatial heterogeneity created by wildfire and the need to incorporate spatial aspects of fire regimes (e.g., creation and protection of refuges) for fire management in fire-prone landscapes.},

The species was recently uplisted from ‘Endangered’ to ‘Critically Endangered’ only two years after its previous uplisting. Intriguingly, populations in highly urbanised Singapore appear relatively secure. However, the last Singaporean density estimates, derived from traditional census methods, were obtained nearly two decades ago in 2001. A recent population estimate in 2016 was derived from the census work in 2001 coupled with relative abundance indices from population trends. We thus performed systematic field surveys using the distance sampling method, estimating 573 Æ 185 individuals nationwide, with a break-down of 217 Æ 81 on the main island of Singapore and 356 Æ 104 birds on the satellite of Pulau Ubin. Taken together, the total population estimate reported here comprises 22.9–57.3\% of the global wild population, underscoring the importance of Singapore as a stronghold for the species. In spite of its apparently secure status in Singapore, the species remains susceptible to local and foreign trapping pressures. Based on our assessment, we propose a number of local and regional conservation measures to ensure the continued survival of populations in Singapore.},

  abstract = {Aerial surveys are a critical tool for inference of wildlife populations, yet are limited by current available methods to account for imperfect detection without marking animals. N-mixture models use count data from replicate surveys for estimation of wildlife abundance while accounting for imperfect detection. This statistical framework was recently developed but is rarely applied to aerial surveys of terrestrial wildlife. We applied an N-mixture model incorporating temporary emigration to a novel aerial survey design to estimate the availability, detection probability, and abundance of an unmarked population of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) in Michigan, USA, using surveys in 2014 and 2016. We assessed the selection of the sample unit size for the N-mixture model in a post hoc sensitivity analysis and compared all estimates to a hierarchical distance sampling (HDS) approach. Hierarchical distance sampling is an expansion of conventional distance sampling (CDS), a standard method applied to aerial survey designs for wildlife, where HDS allows for modeling spatial variation in abundance and detection probability using environmental covariates and can account for changing population demographics. We found N-mixture models produced similar parameter estimates to HDS with both models inferring a population increase between years, which was consistent with independently available estimates for this population (2014 N-mixture = 402 [CI: 303.8–515.27], and HDS = 391 [CI: 297.67–504.63]; 2016 N-mixture = 732 [CI: 572.89–924.22], and HDS = 708 [CI: 552.45–893.89]). Estimates from both models were sensitive to the sample unit size selected in an open population framework. We recommend using ecological (e.g., home range size) and statistical (e.g., sample size) considerations when selecting a sample unit size that reflects the movement ecology of a species and evaluating the sensitivity of parameters to sample unit size. In our study, N-mixture models and HDS models afforded a practical field approach and analytical methodology that resulted in precise estimation in a population of unmarked deer over time. When used with aerial surveys in terrestrial systems where distance sampling methods may be difficult to implement, N-mixture models can address observer error and estimate populations for conservation and management goals without marking individual animals.},

Methodology for fixed-wing aircrafl was developed in the 1970s and has generally become standardized in areas where it is applied. The technique allows for broad-scale coverage of management areas and involves flying at a set height, speed and direction and counting in fixed (generally 200 m) strips. An alternative method using a differentsurvey platform (helicopter),sampling procedure (monitor block) and survey technique (line transect) has been developed recently. The technique has advantages over the standard fixed-wing survey method in accuracy, Species applicability and repeatability with disadvantages in cost, time taken and in coverage of Overall Spatial variation. Other issues related to the benefits and drawbacks of the two methods are discussed.},

  abstract = {It is common to use multiple field sampling methods when implementing wildlife surveys to compare method efficacy or cost efficiency, integrate distinct pieces of information provided by separate methods, or evaluate method-specific biases and misclassification error. Existing models that combine information from multiple field methods or sampling devices permit rigorous comparison of method-specific detection parameters, enable estimation of additional parameters such as false-positive detection probability, and improve occurrence or abundance estimates, but with the assumption that the separate sampling methods produce detections independently of one another. This assumption is tenuous if methods are paired or deployed in close proximity simultaneously, a common practice that reduces the additional effort required to implement multiple methods and reduces the risk that differences between method-specific detection parameters are confounded by other environmental factors. We develop occupancy and spatial capture-recapture models that permit covariance between the detections produced by different methods, use simulation to compare estimator performance of the new models to models assuming independence, and provide an empirical application based on American marten (Martes americana) surveys using paired remote cameras, hair catches, and snow tracking. Simulation results indicate existing models that assume that methods independently detect organisms produce biased parameter estimates and substantially understate estimate uncertainty when this assumption is violated, while our reformulated models are robust to either methodological independence or covariance. Empirical results suggested that remote cameras and snow tracking had comparable probability of detecting present martens, but that snow tracking also produced false-positive marten detections that could potentially substantially bias distribution estimates if not corrected for. Remote cameras detected marten individuals more readily than passive hair catches. Inability to photographically distinguish individual sex did not appear to induce negative bias in camera density estimates; instead, hair catches appeared to produce detection competition between individuals that may have been a source of negative bias. Our model reformulations broaden the range of circumstances in which analyses incorporating multiple sources of information can be robustly used, and our empirical results demonstrate that using multiple field-methods can enhance inferences regarding ecological parameters of interest and improve understanding of how reliably survey methods sample these parameters.},

  abstract = {A critical requirement in the ecological management of fire is knowledge of the age-class distribution of the vegetation. Such knowledge is important because it underpins the distribution of ecological features important to plants and animals including retreat sites, food sources and foraging microhabitats. However, in many regions, knowledge of the ageclass distribution of vegetation is severely constrained by the limited data available on fire history. Much fire-history mapping is restricted to post-1972 fires, following satellite imagery becoming widely available. To investigate fire history in the semi-arid Murray Mallee region in southern Australia, we developed regression models for six species of mallee eucalypt (Eucalyptus oleosa F.Muell. ex. Miq. subsp. oleosa, E. leptophylla F.Muell. ex. Miq., E. dumosa J. Oxley, E. costata subsp. murrayana L. A. S. Johnson \& K. D. Hill, E. gracilis F.Muell. and E. socialis F.Muell. ex. Miq.) to quantify the relationship between mean stem diameter and stem age (indicated by fire-year) at sites of known time since fire. We then used these models to predict mean stem age, and thus infer fire-year, for sites where the time since fire was not known. Validation of the models with independent data revealed a highly significant correlation between the actual and predicted time since fire (r = 0.71, P {$<$} 0.001, n = 88), confirming the utility of this method for ageing stands of mallee eucalypt vegetation. Validation data suggest the models provide a conservative estimate of the age of a site (i.e. they may under-estimate the minimum age of sites {$>$}35 years since fire). Nevertheless, this approach enables examination of post-fire chronosequences in semi-arid mallee ecosystems to be extended from 35 years post-fire to over 100 years. The predicted ages identified for mallee stands imply a need for redefining what is meant by ‘old-growth’ mallee, and challenges current perceptions of an over-abundance of ‘long-unburnt’ mallee vegetation. Given the strong influence of fire on semi-arid mallee vegetation, this approach offers the potential for a better understanding of long-term successional dynamics and the status of biota in an ecosystem that encompasses more than 250 000 km2 of southern Australia.},

  abstract = {Distance sampling is a technique for estimating the abundance of animals or other objects in a region, allowing for imperfect detection. This paper evaluates the statistical efficiency of the method when its assumptions are met, both theoretically and by simulation. The theoretical component of the paper is a derivation of the asymptotic variance penalty for the distance sampling estimator arising from uncertainty about the unknown detection parameters. This asymptotic penalty factor is tabulated for several detection functions. It is typically at least 2 but can be much higher, particularly for steeply declining detection rates. The asymptotic result relies on a model which makes the strong assumption that objects are uniformly distributed across the region. The simulation study relaxes this assumption by incorporating over-dispersion when generating object locations. Distance sampling and strip transect estimators are calculated for simulated data, for a variety of overdispersion factors, detection functions, sample sizes and strip widths. The simulation results confirm the theoretical asymptotic penalty in the non-overdispersed case. For a more realistic overdispersion factor of 2, distance sampling estimation outperforms strip transect estimation when a half-normal distance function is correctly assumed, confirming previous literature. When the hazard rate model is correctly assumed, strip transect estimators have lower mean squared error than the usual distance sampling estimator when the strip width is close enough to its optimal value (+/- 75\% when there are 100 detections; +/- 50\% when there are 200 detections). Whether the ecologist can set the strip width sufficiently accurately will depend on the circumstances of each particular study.},

  abstract = {Despite widespread recognition of the major threat to tropical forest biological diversity and local food security posed by unsustainable bushmeat hunting, virtually no long-term studies tracking the socioecological dynamics of hunting systems have been conducted. We interviewed local hunters and collected detailed hunting data to investigate changes in offtake and hunter characteristics over 10 years (20012010) in Dibouka and Kouagna villages, central Gabon, in the context of hunter recollections of longer term trends since the 1950s. To control for changes in hunter behavior, such as trap location and characteristics, we report hunting offtake data per trap. Our results suggest the hunting area was already highly depleted by 2001; local hunters reported that 16 large-bodied prey species had become rare or locally extirpated over the last 60 years. Overall, we observed no significant declines in hunting offtake or changes in species composition from 2001 to 2010, and offtakes per trap increased slightly between 2004 and 2010. However, trapping distance from the villages increased, and there was a switch in hunting techniques; a larger proportion of the catch was hunted with guns in 2010. The number of hunters declined by 20\% from 2004 to 2010, and male livelihood activities shifted away from hunting. Hunters with the lowest hunting incomes in 2004 were more likely than successful hunters to have moved away from the village by 2010 (often in response to alternative employment opportunities). Therefore, changes in trap success (potentially related to biological factors) were interacting with system-level changes in hunter number and composition (related to external socioeconomic factors) to produce a relatively static overall offtake. Our results highlight the importance of understanding the small-scale context of hunting to correctly interpret changes or apparent stasis in hunting effort and offtake over time.},

Sighting efforts using distance sampling during spring were found to be the most effective estimators of bushbuck density and abundance at Shongweni Dam and Game Reserve. Furthermore, the method had high repeatability and simplicity, and low costs.

Within predefined land cover types surrounding each survey point, we used Geographic Information Systems to determine the proportions of each land cover type present. We used randomization tests to compare proportions of land cover types present at points with and without doves. We used Program DISTANCE to estimate dove densities at survey points and to test whether certain land cover types were associated with greater dove densities. Our results indicated white-winged dove occurrence in South Texas was positively associated with urban land and cropland, whereas mourning dove occurrence was positively associated with cropland. For land cover types found to be associated with dove presence, estimated density for each dove species increased as the proportion of associated land cover type increased. These results can assist wildlife biologists in the development of a more efficient and targeted protocol for censusing doves. In addition, our methods can be applied to other species across several geographic areas and landscape scales.},

Countless methods for estimating these parameters exist, making it essential to assess the limitations and biases associated with a particular sampling protocol. Here, we compare between 2 methods commonly used to survey nearshore fish assemblages. Although most commonly employed, underwater visual census (UVC) may yield biased estimates of abundance depending on the strength of a fish's behavioural response (i.e. avoidance, attraction) to the presence of divers. Baited remote underwater video (BRUV) techniques have shown promise in overcoming some of the limitations of UVC, but are unable to provide an absolute measure of density in turbulent environments. We compare the abilities of these 2 methods to survey the nearshore rocky reef ichthyofauna of Southeast Australia. We found that relative to BRUV, UVC recorded more individuals (in terms of all species, herbivores, cryptic species, and most territorial species), higher richness at both the species and family level, and higher biodiversity as measured using the Shannon Index. These findings remain even when the data were adjusted for differences in sampling effort. In contrast, BRUV recorded proportionally more mobile predators, and a more taxonomically distinct population, though only when taxonomic evenness was not taken into account. Twenty species were unique to UVC and 17 species unique to BRUV. Considering this, studies aimed at cataloguing diversity should apply multiple methods, However, when logistical or financial constraints limit biodiversity studies to only 1 method, UVC will likely provide a more complete estimate of temperate reef fish diversity than BRUV.},

  abstract = {Many organisms are patchily distributed, with some patches occupied at high density, others at lower densities, and others not occupied. Estimation of overall abundance can be difficult and is inefficient via intensive approaches such as capture-mark-recapture (CMR) or distance sampling. We propose a two-phase sampling scheme and model in a Bayesian framework to estimate abundance for patchily distributed populations. In the first phase, occupancy is estimated by binomial detection samples taken on all selected sites, where selection may be of all sites available, or a random sample of sites. Detection can be by visual surveys, detection of sign, physical captures, or other approach. At the second phase, if a detection threshold is achieved, CMR or other intensive sampling is conducted via standard procedures (grids or webs) to estimate abundance. Detection and CMR data are then used in a joint likelihood to model probability of detection in the occupancy sample via an abundance detection model. CMR modeling is used to estimate abundance for the abundance-detection relationship, which in turn is used to predict abundance at the remaining sites, where only detection data are collected. We present a full Bayesian modeling treatment of this problem, in which posterior inference on abundance and other parameters (detection, capture probability) is obtained under a variety of assumptions about spatial and individual sources of heterogeneity. We apply the approach to abundance estimation for two species of voles (Microtus spp.) in Montana, USA. We also use a simulation study to evaluate the frequentist properties of our procedure given known patterns in abundance and detection among sites as well as design criteria. For most population characteristics and designs considered, bias and mean-square error (MSE) were low, and coverage of true parameter values by Bayesian credibility intervals was near nominal. Our two-phase, adaptive approach allows efficient estimation of abundance of rare and patchily distributed species and is particularly appropriate when sampling in all patches is impossible, but a global estimate of abundance is required.},

  abstract = {Most efforts to link remote sensing to species distributions and movement have focused on indirect estimates of traits based on components of physiological and functional biodiversity. Such a view reflects one perspective on the general needs (habitat) of species. However, information on the vertical and horizontal structure of habitat may play a critical role in defining what a suitable habitat is. The development and application of highly accurate airborne laser scanning (ALS) systems, which are capable of describing the three-dimensional distribution of vegetation, have significant potential value in deriving quantitative relationships between species distributions and their habitat structure. In this paper we review the use of ALS for biodiversity studies, and propose a three-dimensional index which captures the three main components of vertical and horizontal vegetation structure: height, cover, and complexity. Once developed, we apply the index across the forested area of the Canadian province of Alberta, and compare and contrast the differences across natural subregions and land cover types. We also demonstrate how the index can be used with biodiversity data, in this case examining patterns in avian species richness. We conclude with a discussion on the potential use of the habitat structure index with other biodiversity-related research.},

Mark-recapture models were used to estimate abundance, which was converted to density using estimates of effective trap area. Tests of model assumptions provided by CAPTURE indicated pronounced heterogeneity in capture probabilities and some indication of behavioral response and variation over time. Mean estimated density was 1.80 mongooses/ha (range, 1.37-2.15/ha) with estimated coefficients of variation of 4.68-11.92\% ((X) over bar = 7.46\%). Estimates of density based on mark-recapture data depended heavily on assumptions about animal home ranges; variances of densities also may be underestimated, leading to unrealistically narrow confidence intervals. Estimates based on trap webs require fewer assumptions, and estimated variances may be a more realistic representation of sampling variation. Because trap webs are established easily and provide adequate data for estimation in a few sample occasions, the method should be efficient and reliable for estimating densities of mongooses.},

Data from roadkill surveys is generally used to choose the best mitigation measures, but there is a lack of knowledge about the sampling intensity required for surveys to effectively detect roadkill patterns. Improving the cost-effectiveness of road surveys could free up limited resources that, in turn, could be used to obtain a better perception of road impacts and mitigation effectiveness elsewhere. We evaluate the possibility of improving road survey cost-effectiveness by comparing the spatial patterns obtained when using a weekly versus monthly survey and year-round versus seasonal surveys. We analyzed a roadkill dataset, previously collected over 2 years in southern Brazil, and applied two criteria for assessing the effectiveness of two alternative survey protocols: tradeoff between sampling effort and sample size; and similarity in spatial patterns. We found support favoring monthly surveys for those taxa in which roadkill was not markedly temporally clustered, as was the case for larger mammals. However, performing weekly surveys over shorter periods may significantly improve cost-effectiveness for taxa with peaks in mortality if surveys are performed during those periods when roadkill is most likely to occur. We suggest applying a mix of sampling protocols, with intensive surveys during warmer periods for reptiles and other taxa with peak roadkill at these times while, for the rest of the year, a monthly survey could be used to improve detection of rarer species.},

  abstract = {Although dramatic amphibian declines have been documented worldwide, only few of such events have been quantitatively documented for the tropical forests of South America. This is due partly to the fact that tropical amphibians are patchily distributed and difficult to detect. We tested three methods often used to monitor population trends in amphibian species in a remote lowland tropical forest of French Guiana. These methods are capture-mark-recapture (CMR), estimation of the number of calling males with repeated counts data and distance sampling, and rates of occupancy inferred by presence/absence data. We monitored eight diurnal, terrestrial amphibian species including five Dendrobatidae and three Bufonidae. We found that CMR, the most precise way of estimating population size, can be used only with two species in high density patches where the recapture rate is high enough. Only for one of the species (Dendrobates tinctorius), a low coefficient of variation (CV = 0.19) can be achieved with 15 to 20 capture events. For dendrobatid species with day-calling males, audio surveys yield a better probability of detection with only 8 audio surveys needed; quantitative estimates can be achieved by computing the number of calling males inferred from audio counts or distance sampling analysis. We therefore suggest that an efficient monitoring protocol for Neotropical amphibian species should include a combination of sighting and audio techniques, and we discuss the need of implementing a large-scale monitoring in order to provide a baseline for comparison with future changes.},

  abstract = {Abstract Context Determining population size or density is often fundamental for wildlife conservation. For nocturnal species, indices are commonly used in place of abundance estimates, with spotlighting indices (e.g. sighting rate per km) being prevalent. Distance sampling is a collection of techniques that provide estimates of wildlife abundance from line-transect data, by correcting raw counts for imperfect detection. These methods have rarely been used to assess the abundance of nocturnal arboreal mammals. Aims To develop and evaluate a method for estimating the abundance and density of nocturnal arboreal mammals using double-observer distance sampling, and to apply the approach to a survey of the southern greater glider (Petauroides volans) in the Strathbogie Ranges, Victoria, Australia. Methods Two observers, 15–20 min apart, surveyed 25 randomly located 500 m transects, and recorded greater gliders using spotlights and binoculars. Densities and abundances were derived from the line-transect data by using mark–recapture distance sampling (MRDS) models and were compared with conventional distance sampling analysis (CDS). Key results Using the double-observer approach, we estimated an overall density of 0.96 gliders ha−1 (95\% CI 0.60–1.50), giving a population estimate of 24 575 greater gliders across the Strathbogie Ranges (25 865 ha, 95\% CI 15 620–38 661). The corresponding estimates for the study area derived using CDS applied to either both observers’ observations or to the first observer’s observations only, were 87\% and 53\% respectively, of the MRDS estimate. The analysis confirmed that the probability of detection of gliders along the transect line was less than one, justifying the use of the double-observer method to obtain accurate estimates of abundance. Conclusions The low detectability of greater gliders means that uncorrected spotlight counts will underestimate abundance, as will CDS. The double-observer method corrects for the negative bias associated with raw counts, enabling more accurate estimation of abundance for survey, monitoring and management purposes. Implications We recommend that double-observer distance sampling is adopted as a standard technique for estimating the abundance of greater gliders. The double-observer method potentially has wider relevance for assessing population size of other arboreal mammals, providing the assumptions of the approach can be met.},

  abstract = {Within protected areas, biodiversity loss is often a consequence of illegal resource use. Understanding the patterns and extent of illegal activities is therefore essential for effective law enforcement and prevention of biodiversity declines. We used extensive data, commonly collected by ranger patrols in many protected areas, and Bayesian hierarchical models to identify drivers, trends, and distribution of multiple illegal activities within the Queen Elizabeth Conservation Area (QECA), Uganda. Encroachment (e.g., by pastoralists with cattle) and poaching of noncommercial animals (e.g., snaring bushmeat) were the most prevalent illegal activities within the QECA. Illegal activities occurred in different areas of the QECA. Poaching of noncommercial animals was most widely distributed within the national park. Overall, ecological covariates, although significant, were not useful predictors for occurrence of illegal activities. Instead, the location of illegal activities in previous years was more important. There were significant increases in encroachment and noncommercial plant harvesting (nontimber products) during the study period (1999-2012). We also found significant spatiotemporal variation in the occurrence of all activities. Our results show the need to explicitly model ranger patrol effort to reduce biases from existing uncorrected or capture per unit effort analyses. Prioritization of ranger patrol strategies is needed to target illegal activities; these strategies are determined by protected area managers, and therefore changes at a site-level can be implemented quickly. These strategies should also be informed by the location of past occurrences of illegal activity: the most useful predictor of future events. However, because spatial and temporal changes in illegal activities occurred, regular patrols throughout the protected area, even in areas of low occurrence, are also required.},

  abstract = {Bushmeat hunting is extensive in west and central Africa as both a means for subsistence and for commercial gain. Commercial hunting represents one of the primary threats to wildlife in the region, and confounding factors have made it challenging to examine how external factors influence the commercial bushmeat trade. Bioko Island, Equatorial Guinea is a small island with large tracts of intact forest that support sizeable populations of commercially valuable vertebrates, especially endemic primates. The island also has a low human population and has experienced dramatic economic growth and rapid development since the mid-1990's. From October 1997 - September 2010, we monitored the largest bushmeat market on Bioko in Malabo, recording over 197,000 carcasses for sale. We used these data to analyze the dynamics of the market in relation to political events, environmental legislation, and rapid economic growth. Our findings suggest that bushmeat hunting and availability increased in parallel with the growth of Equatorial Guinea's GDP and disposable income of its citizens. During this 13-year study, the predominant mode of capture shifted from trapping to shotguns. Consequently, carcass volume and rates of taxa typically captured with shotguns increased significantly, most notably including intensified hunting of Bioko's unique and endangered monkey fauna. Attempts to limit bushmeat sales, including a 2007 ban on primate hunting and trade, were only transiently effective. The hunting ban was not enforced, and was quickly followed by a marked increase in bushmeat hunting compared to hunting rates prior to the ban. Our results emphasize the negative impact that rapid development and unenforced legislation have had on Bioko's wildlife, and demonstrate the need for strong governmental support if conservation strategies are to be successful at preventing extinctions of tropical wildlife.},

  abstract = {Accurate and precise abundance estimation is vital for informed wildlife conservation and management decision-making. Line transect surveys are a common sampling approach for abundance estimation. Distance sampling is often used to estimate abundance from line transect survey data; however, search encounter spatial capture-recapture can also be used when individuals in the population of interest are identifiable. The search encounter spatial capture-recapture model has rarely been applied, and its performance has not been compared to that of distance sampling. We analyzed simulated datasets to compare the performance of distance sampling and spatial capture-recapture abundance estimators. Additionally, we estimated the abundance of North Atlantic right whales in the southeastern United States with two formulations of each model and compared the estimates. Spatial capture-recapture abundance estimates had lower root mean squared error than distance sampling estimates. Spatial capture-recapture 95\% credible intervals for abundance had nominal coverage, i.e., contained the simulating value for abundance in 95\% of simulations, whereas distance sampling credible intervals had below nominal coverage. Moreover, North Atlantic right whale abundance estimates from distance sampling models were more sensitive to model specification compared to spatial capture-recapture estimates. When estimating abundance from line transect data, researchers should consider using search encounter spatial capture-recapture when individuals in the population of interest are identifiable, when line transects are surveyed over multiple occasions, when there is imperfect detection of individuals located on the line transect, and when it is safe to assume the population of interest is closed demographically. When line transects are surveyed over multiple occasions, researchers should be aware that individual space use may induce spatial autocorrelation in counts across transects. This is not accounted for in common distance sampling estimators and leads to overly precise abundance estimates.},

The effect of measurement error when applying a visual determination of plant cover is considered. Generally, the estimation of the mean plant cover was well-behaved and unbiased for all the three methods, whereas the estimate of the intra-plot correlation tended to be upward biased and especially so if the plant cover data was collected using the Braun-Blanquet method. It was surprising that the Braun-Blanquet sampling procedure provided mean plant cover estimates that were comparable to the other sampling schemes. This method shows promise in the attempt to use the large amount of historic Braun-Blanquet plant cover data in the investigation of the underlying causes for observed vegetation changes.},

To date, however, it has been underused in studying wild populations of animals and, particularly, in obtaining quantitative abundance estimates. We evaluated LEK as a tool for collecting extensive data on local animal abundance and population trends. We interviewed shepherds in southeastern Spain, asking them to estimate the local abundance of the terrestrial tortoise Testudo graeca. We quantified reliability of abundance estimates derived from interviews by comparing them with those obtained from standard field-sampling protocols (distance sampling). We also explored the complementarity of these 2 approaches. LEK provided high-quality and low-cost information about both distribution and abundance of T. graeca. Interviews with shepherds yielded abundance estimates in a much wider range than linear transects, which only detected the species in the upper two-thirds of its abundance range. Abundance estimates from both methodologies showed a close relationship. Analysis of confidence intervals indicated local knowledge could be used to estimate mean local abundances and to detect mean population trends. A cost analysis determined that the information derived from LEK was 100 times cheaper than that obtained through linear-transect surveys. Our results should further the use of LEK as a standard tool for sampling the quantitative abundance of a great variety of taxa, particularly when population densities are low and traditional sampling methods are expensive or difficult to implement.},

Building on the case studies in this Invited Feature and on ecological principles, we identify opportunities for regional land management that maintain both ecological function in protected areas and human land use options, including preserving crucial habitats and migration corridors, and reducing dependence of local human populations on protected area resources. Identification of appropriate and effective management opportunities depends on clear definitions of: (1) the biodiversity attributes of concern; (2) landscape connections to delineate particular locations with strong ecological interactions between the protected area and its surrounding landscape; and (3) socioeconomic dynamics that determine current and future use of land resources in and around the protected area.},

Despite the importance of these practices, few studies from the region have analyzed the socioeconomic drivers of hunting and fishing at the household level. We propose a household production model to assess the effect of key economic parameters on hunting and fishing in small indigenous communities located in the Ecuadorian Amazon, whose principal source of protein is derived from hunting and fishing. The model was validated using empirical data from two communities that reflect different levels of market integration and forest conservation. Demand and supply functions were generated from household data gathered over 19 months. Elasticities were derived to determine the sensitivity of the decision to engage in hunting to exogenous parameters such as off-farm wages, hunting costs, bushmeat price, penalties for the illegal sale of bushmeat, and biological characteristics of the game species. After calibrating the model, we simulated changes in the key economic parameters. The parameter that most directly affected hunting activity in both communities was off-farm wages. Simulating a 10\% wage increase resulted in a 16-20\% reduction in harvested biomass, while a 50\% increase diminished harvested biomass by {$>$} 50\%. Model simulations revealed that bushmeat price and penalties for illegal trade also had important effects on hunter behavior in terms of amount of bushmeat sold, but not in terms of total harvest. As a tool for understanding hunters' economic decision-making, the model provides a basis for developing strategies that promote sustainable hunting and wildlife conservation while protecting indigenous livelihoods.},

False negatives are the result of our inability to perfectly detect species, especially those at low density such as endangered species or newly arriving introduced species. They reduce our ability to interpret presence–absence survey data and make sound management decisions (e.g., rapid response). To reduce the probability of false negatives, we need to compare the efficacy and sensitivity of different sampling approaches and quantify an unbiased estimate of the probability of detection. We conducted field experiments in the intertidal zone of New England and New York to test the sensitivity of two sampling approaches (quadrat vs. total area search, TAS), given different target characteristics (mobile vs. sessile). Using logistic regression we built detection curves for each sampling approach that related the sampling intensity and the density of targets to the probability of detection. The TAS approach reduced the probability of false negatives and detected targets faster than the quadrat approach. Mobility of targets increased the time to detection but did not affect detection success. Finally, we interpreted two years of presence–absence data on the distribution of the Asian shore crab (Hemigrapsus sanguineus) in New England and New York, using our probability model for false negatives. The type of experimental approach in this paper can help to reduce false negatives and increase our ability to detect species at low densities by refining sampling approaches, which can guide conservation strategies and management decisions in various areas of ecology such as conservation biology and invasion ecology.},

In this study, the regularized spline with tension (RST) interpolation method and ELECTRE TRI MCDA was used to predict forest stand volumes in an area characterized by even-aged stands with heterogeneous structures in Turkey. Sampling data (1050 circular sample plots) were obtained from the National forest inventory. For each species and diameter class, a map of the predicted volume per ha was obtained using the RST method. By repeating the same process for the eight species occurring in the study area, 31 volume maps were produced. The accuracy of these prediction maps was assessed at pixel (20 x 20 m) and area scale (per ha). An accuracy of more than 97\% was achieved at the pixel level, whereas a minimum accuracy of 86\% was achieved for the area-based estimations. In addition, predicted values from the above 31 volume maps were compared with the observed values from management plan reports obtained from the Government Institute responsinble for forest management plans. The comparisons showed an accuracy of predictions of 21, 14, 4, and 2\% for Calabrian pine, Oriental beech, black pine and oak species, respectively. Following interpolation, volume prediction maps were geo-computed, and a volume-based stand map was produced. The 890 different combinations of species composition and diameter classes were classified according to expert knowledge by the use of ELECTRE TRI MCDA, obtaining a final stand type map representing 70 different profile categories based on species mixture rates and diameter classes for the area analyzed.},

Focusing on the insular population on Groote Eylandt, Northern Territory, we present the first study to successfully use live traps, camera traps and radio-tracking to document the ecology of N. aquilo. Searches for signs of the species, camera trapping, pitfall trapping and spotlighting were conducted across the island during 2012-15. These methods detected the species in three of the 32 locations surveyed. Pitfall traps captured 39 individuals over 7917 trap-nights. Females were significantly longer and heavier, and had better body condition, than males. Breeding occurred throughout the year; however, the greatest influx of juveniles into the population occurred early in the dry season in June and July. Nine individuals radio-tracked in woodland habitat utilised discrete home ranges of 0.39-23.95ha. All individuals used open microhabitat proportionally more than was available, and there was a strong preference for eucalypt woodland on sandy substrate rather than for adjacent sandstone woodland or acacia shrubland. Camera trapping was more effective than live trapping at estimating abundance and, with the lower effort required to employ this technique, it is recommended for future sampling of the species. Groote Eylandt possibly contains the last populations of N. aquilo, but even there its abundance and distribution have decreased dramatically in surveys over the last several decades. Therefore, we recommend that the species' conservation status under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 be changed from 'vulnerable' to 'endangered'.

I examined two years of data from Tambopata, southeastern Peru, to compare and contrast visual encounter survey (VES) and quadrat methodologies and to determine which method yields the highest number of individuals and species per sampling effort. Four separate questions were posed concerning the number of captures for short-term surveys, long-term surveys, arboreal versus terrestrial amphibian surveys, and particular taxonomic group surveys. Over most of the analyses, more individuals and species of amphibians and reptiles were captured using VES than quadrats. In addition, more unique species were recorded with VES. However, particular microhabitats and taxonomic groups were better sampled with quadrats. In long-term surveys, the methods were equivalent with respect to number of individuals and species captured. This study provides quantitative data on the efficacy of the two methods and describes, for the first time, the particular instances in which the different methods are best suited for sampling rain forest herpetofauna.]},

  abstract = {A critical variable in both ecological and conservation field studies is determining how many individuals of a species are present within a defined sampling area. Labor intensive techniques such as capture-mark-recapture and removal sampling may provide estimates of abundance, but there are many logistical constraints to their widespread application. Many studies on terrestrial and aquatic salamanders use counts as an index of abundance, assuming that detection remains constant while sampling. If this constancy is violated, determination of detection probabilities is critical to the accurate estimation of abundance. Recently, a model was developed that provides a statistical approach that allows abundance and detection to be estimated simultaneously from spatially and temporally replicated counts. We adapted this model to estimate these parameters for salamanders sampled over a six year period in area-constrained plots in Great Smoky Mountains National Park. Estimates of salamander abundance varied among years, but annual changes in abundance did not vary uniformly among species. Except for one species, abundance estimates were not correlated with site covariates (elevation, soil and water pH, conductivity, air and water temperature). The uncertainty in the estimates was so large as to make correlations ineffectual in predicting which covariates might influence abundance. Detection probabilities also varied among species and sometimes among years for the six species examined. We found such a high degree of variation in our counts and in estimates of detection among species, sites, and years as to cast doubt upon the appropriateness of using count data to monitor population trends using a small number of area-constrained survey plots. Still, the model provided reasonable estimates of abundance that could make it useful in estimating population size from count surveys.},

There has been much written about sampling design, spatial scale and the need for permanent plots in long-term monitoring but very few authors have considered how to locate and re-find positions in the field accurately. Indeed, many attempts at re-sampling exact positions set up many years previously have failed. 2. Various field measurement systems were compared including 50-m tape, consumer-grade GPS, total-station theodolite and differential GPS. 3. Both total station and differential GPS were able to measure and relocate quadrats accurately to within a few centimetres over distances of hundreds of metres or more. 4. Of over 500 1 x 1 m vegetation monitoring quadrats set out and location re-recorded by differential GPS at sites across UK, only 1\% had positional errors of more than 0 2 m. None of these quadrat locations relied on permanent markers. Differential GPS has the advantage of speed and delivering coordinates in latitude/longitude or local coordinate system directly. 5. Accurately located quadrats can be resurveyed many years in the future just using the original coordinates without worrying about ` permanent' markers that rarely turn out to be truly permanent. If more researchers used these techniques, then there is huge potential for establishing networks of accurate long-term monitoring positions, which could provide information on a wide range of topics, such as vegetation dynamics and environmental change even if these were not the original research objectives.},

  abstract = {Aim During the past decade ecologists have attempted to estimate the parameters of species distribution models by combining locations of species presence observed in opportunistic surveys with spatially referenced covariates of occurrence. Several statistical models have been proposed for the analysis of presence-only data, but these models have largely ignored the effects of imperfect detection and survey bias. In this paper I describe a model-based approach for the analysis of presence-only data that accounts for errors in the detection of individuals and for biased selection of survey locations. Innovation I develop a hierarchical, statistical model that allows presence-only data to be analysed in conjunction with data acquired independently in planned surveys. One component of the model specifies the spatial distribution of individuals within a bounded, geographic region as a realization of a spatial point process. A second component of the model specifies two kinds of observations, the detection of individuals encountered during opportunistic surveys and the detection of individuals encountered during planned surveys. Main conclusions Using mathematical proof and simulation-based comparisons, I demonstrate that biases induced by errors in detection or biased selection of survey locations can be reduced or eliminated by using the hierarchical model to analyse presence-only data in conjunction with counts observed in planned surveys. I show that a relatively small number of high-quality data (from planned surveys) can be used to leverage the information in presence-only observations, which usually have broad spatial coverage but may not be informative of both occurrence and detectability of individuals. Because a variety of sampling protocols can be used in planned surveys, this approach to the analysis of presence-only data is widely applicable. In addition, since the point-process model is formulated at the level of an individual, it can be extended to account for biological interactions between individuals and temporal changes in their spatial distributions.},

  abstract = {Camera traps have potential as a cost-and time-efficient technique to survey mammal species diversity and to monitor changes in abundance. During a survey of mammals in Tasmanian coastal woodland and heathland, we compared species richness and indices of abundance obtained from, and survey effort for, baited camera and live traps at the same trap stations on four trapping blocks over 3 nights during two survey periods (March and August-September). More mammal species were detected by camera traps than live traps, partly because of the greater size range of species susceptible to camera traps; yet other rarely live-trapped and some commonly live-trapped species were recorded only on cameras. All but one species, the swamp rat (Rattus lutreolus), were detected at more trap stations by camera traps than by live traps. For those species detected by both techniques, on all four blocks combined, indices of abundance were positively correlated. For the most commonly caught species, the long-nosed potoroo (Potorous tridactylus), there were positive correlations between numbers live trapped and numbers of visits caught on camera at both the spatial scale of the block and of the trap station; however, this relationship was not consistent between survey periods. Higher numbers of detections of P. tridactylus on camera traps allowed finer grained interpretation of results, implying that live trapping reflects the mammal community less efficiently than camera trapping. Camera trapping required similar to 50\% of the person-hours needed for live trapping. Compared with live trapping, camera traps are a more time-efficient method of detecting differences and monitoring changes in abundance of Australian mammals.},

  abstract = {Recovering small populations of threatened species is an important global conservation strategy. Monitoring the anticipated recovery, however, often relies on uncertain abundance indices rather than on rigorous demographic estimates. To counter the severe threat from poaching of wild tigers (Panthera tigris), the Government of Thailand established an intensive patrolling system in 2005 to protect and recover its largest source population in Huai Kha Khaeng Wildlife Sanctuary. Concurrently, we assessed the dynamics of this tiger population over the next 8 years with rigorous photographic capture-recapture methods. From 2006 to 2012, we sampled across 624-1026 km(2) with 137-200 camera traps. Cameras deployed for 21,359 trap days yielded photographic records of 90 distinct individuals. We used closed model Bayesian spatial capture-recapture methods to estimate tiger abundances annually. Abundance estimates were integrated with likelihood-based open model analyses to estimate rates of annual and overall rates of survival, recruitment, and changes in abundance. Estimates of demographic parameters fluctuated widely: annual density ranged from 1.25 to 2.01 tigers/100 km(2), abundance from 35 to 58 tigers, survival from 79.6\% to 95.5\%, and annual recruitment from 0 to 25 tigers. The number of distinct individuals photographed demonstrates the value of photographic capture-recapture methods for assessments of population dynamics in rare and elusive species that are identifiable from natural markings. Possibly because of poaching pressure, overall tiger densities at Huai Kha Khaeng were 82-90\% lower than in ecologically comparable sites in India. However, intensified patrolling after 2006 appeared to reduce poaching and was correlated with marginal improvement in tiger survival and recruitment. Our results suggest that population recovery of low-density tiger populations may be slower than anticipated by current global strategies aimed at doubling the number of wild tigers in a decade.},

Perpendicular distance sampling (PDS) is one of the several efficient new methods that have been proposed for CWD inventory. One drawback of PDS is that the maximum search distance can be very large, especially if CWD diameters are large or the volume factor chosen is small. Here, we propose a modified method, which we call distance-limited PDS, that addresses this limitation. We describe the field procedures, develop new a new estimator, and provide a proof of unbiasedness of that estimator. The new method is compared with line intersect sampling (LIS) and PDS in a field trial in the northeastern United States. The results of the field trial show that this new method requires as little as 1/10 the sampling effort of LIS in order to achieve comparable variance of the estimates.},

This is "cost-effective conservation"-a process that incorporates both monetized benefits and costs. Though controversial, cost-effective conservation is poorly understood and rarely implemented by planners. Drawing from the largest publicly financed conservation programs in the United States, this paper seeks to improve the communication from economists to planners and to overcome resistance to cost-effective conservation. Fifteen practical lessons are distilled, including the negative implications of limiting selection with political constraints, using nonmonetized benefit measures or benefit indices, ignoring development risk, using incomplete cost measures, employing cost measures sequentially, and using benefit indices to capture costs. The paper highlights interrelationships between benefits and complications such as capitalization and intertemporal planning. The paper concludes by identifying the challenges at the research frontier, including incentive problems associated with adverse selection, additionality, and slippage. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Other large herbivores were recorded, even though some species were not easily seen from the air in savannah woodlands. Population estimates for species other than elephant provided indices of abundance that could be used to determine temporal trends in population size. This study tests for significant trends in the abundance of large herbivores in Gonarezhou National Park, assuming that data from aerial sample surveys designed for elephant also provide accurate estimates of real trends in the populations of other herbivores. For each species, the exponential rate of population change was calculated using weighted regression, with the variance of this rate based on the sampling variances of the population estimates. Significant population trends were detected for eight species. Before the 1992 drought, elephant number was held approximately constant by frequent culls, but afterwards, it increased at a mean annual rate of 6.2\% (confidence limits 4.0\% and 8.6\%). Elephants in cow herds increased at 7.3\%, significantly faster than elephants in bull herds (-0.5\%).

Bushmeat markets are found in a large number of human settlements throughout the region and may be used to monitor the state of game species in catchment areas. As depletion of large-bodied species forces hunters to focus on small-bodied species this is likely to be reflected in the mean body mass and species composition of animals sold in that market. In this paper we present data on bushmeat sold in Basankusu market in the Democratic Republic of Congo during a 2-year period (276 sample days). We counted 10,358 carcasses of 33 mammal taxa, emerging from nine well-defined hunting catchment zone; an area of more than 45,000 km(2). For each catchment we assessed human pressures using metrics derived from remote sensing. Human population density correlated with higher species richness of species harvested, as well as with an increase in rarer taxa, and with a tendency for more individuals with higher intrinsic rates of reproduction to be observed. We suggest that simple surrogates of anthropogenic pressure and faunal characteristics in markets can be used as a rapid tool to measure faunal depletion of mammals at a regional scale. Such a system of evidence-based game monitoring would allow identification of both potentially overhunted and of less-disturbed areas for consideration in strategic planning. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Variation between individual divers within volunteer and professional groups also contributed little to total estimated variance between transects compared to residual variation between replicate transects, variation between sites, and variation between regions studied. Sites in 11 MPAs distributed around 5000 km of the Australian coastline had significantly more large ({$>$} 30 cm) fishes and total fish biomass than nearby fished reference sites. For the older MPAs, fishes belonging to the largest size class (≥80 cm) were observed approximately 10 times more often in sanctuary zones than in fished zones, while fishes in the smallest size class (2.5 cm) occurred at densities approximately 4 times higher in fished zones than in sanctuary zones. Results of our empirical field surveys contrast in several respects with outcomes of published meta-analyses. No overall differences in fish densities were evident between sanctuary zones and fished zones. The response of fish species richness to protection varied significantly between different MPAs, while invertebrate density and species richness were both significantly lower in sanctuary zones than in fished zones.},

This was tested against a simulation model of population dynamics, accounting for uncertainties in demography, observation, and implementation. Results showed it to reliably set sustainable quotas despite these uncertainties, providing a robust foundation for the conservation of hunted species.},

Total dabbling duck population estimates averaged 117,000, and total diving duck estimates averaged 399,000. Annual population estimates generally were imprecise (coefficients of variation [CVs] averaged 0.52 and ranged from 0.20 to 0.97), resulting in generally low probability ({$<$}0.70) of detecting annual rates of change of {$<$}0.09 over 10-years (α = 0.10). Serial correlation of population estimates from repeated sampling of survey units potentially inflated Type I error rates above the nominal α = 0.10 level, and were accounted for in our analyses by specifying lower α levels for rejection. We recommend that winter surveys of ducks be spatially replicated to assure CV {$<$}25\% of annual abundance estimates. Replicates should be randomly drawn each year of the survey to avoid serial correlation in the estimates; if precluded by logistical constraints, investigators should estimate, ideally through simulation, the effect of serial correlation on Type I error rates.},

  abstract = {Population studies are widely used in conservation and management efforts, but acquiring necessary data sets can be difficult. Convenience sampling or camera monitoring may result in biased outcomes, while explicit approaches such as genetic analysis may be impractical due to cost and time. Traditional mark recapture methods are frequently intrusive and pose risk to both animals and handlers that could lead to mortality. These factors highlight the need for a simple, inexpensive, and non-invasive approach to assess species density. One possible technique which addresses these issues is track plate footprinting. We collected raccoon (Procyon lotor) footprints and examined the ability to distinguish individuals by their metacarpal pads from a 225 ha reserve. The probability of identity (PID) for back right feet ranged from 5.72 x 10(-9) - 6.71 x 10(-12) and from 3.34 x 10(-8) - 3.55 x 10(-10) for the back left feet, indicating that it was unlikely any two raccoons shared the same papillae pattern. The minimum number of raccoons known to be alive was estimated to be 12-17 individuals depending upon the foot and scale of resolution used, with estimates from program the Capture ranging from 34-38 raccoons. Our results show that track plate footprint can be used to unambiguously identify individual raccoons, may be useful in mark-recapture studies, and is likely to be applicable to other species with large pads.},

  abstract = {To estimate the spatial intensity (density) of plants and animals, ecologists often sample populations by prespecifing a spatial array of points, then measuring the distance from each point to the k nearest organisms, a so-called k-tree sampling method. A variety of ad hoc methods are available for estimating intensity from k-tree sampling data, but they assume that two distinct points of the array do not share nearest neighbors. However, nearest neighbors are likely to be shared when the population intensity is low, as it is in our application. The purpose of this paper is twofold: (a)~to derive and use for estimation the likelihood function for a k-tree sample under an inhomogeneous Poisson point-process model and (b)~to estimate spatial intensity when nearest neighbors are shared. We derive the likelihood function for an inhomogeneous Poisson point-process with intensity λ(x,y) and propose a likelihood-based, kernel-smoothed estimator \$\textbackslash hat\{\textbackslash lambda\}(x,y)\$. Performance of the method for k=1 is tested on four types of simulated populations: two homogeneous populations with low and high intensity, a population simulated from a bivariate normal distribution of intensity, and a “cliff” population in which the region is divided into high- and low-intensity subregions. The method correctly detected spatial variation in intensity across different subregions of the simulated populations. Application to 1-tree samples of carnivorous pitcher plants populations in four New England peat bogs suggests that the method adequately captures empirical patterns of spatial intensity. However, our method suffers from two evident sources of bias. First, like other kernel smoothers, it underestimates peaks and overestimates valleys. Second, it has positive bias analogous to that of the MLE for the rate parameter of exponential random variables.},

  abstract = {1. Methods papers play a crucial role in advancing applied ecology. Counting organisms, in particular, has a rich history of methods development with many key advances both in field sampling and the treatment of resulting data. 2. Most counts, however, have associated errors due to portions of the population of interest being unavailable for detection (e.g. target population not fully sampled; individuals present but not detectable), detection mistakes (e.g. detectable individuals missed; non-existent individuals recorded), or erroneous counts (e.g. large groups miscounted; individuals misidentified). 3. Developments in field methods focus on reducing biases in the actual counts. Simultaneously, statisticians have developed many methods for improving inference by quantifying and correcting for biases retrospectively. Prominent examples of methods used to account for detection errors include distance sampling and multiple-observer methods. 4. Simulations, in which population characteristics are set by the investigator, provide an efficient means of testing methods. With good estimates of sampling biases, computer Simulations can be used to evaluate how much a given counting problem affects estimates of parameters such as population size and decline, thereby allowing applied ecologists to test the efficacy of sampling designs. Combined with cost estimates for each field method, such models would allow the cost-effectiveness of alternative protocols to be assessed. 5. Synthesis and applications. Major advances are likely to come from research that looks for systematic patterns, across studies, in the effects of different types of bias and assumption violation on the ecological conclusions drawn. Specifically, determining how often, and tinder what circumstances, errors contribute to poor management and policy would greatly enhance future application of ecological knowledge.},

Variable area transect (VAT) sampling had been identified, and optimized relative to effort, in previous Monte Carlo simulated population studies as a low-labor field method that demonstrated superior estimation properties among many PDEs considered. However, natural populations tend to be much more complex and less predictable in spatial distribution than computer generated populations. Therefore, we carried out a Monte Carlo simulation study that used 17 fully enumerated field populations rather than simulated populations. These natural populations represented a variety of population densities and spatial patterns. We focused on assessing the effect of the number of population members searched for along each transect (r), sample size, and transect width on estimation quality. Using relative root mean-squared error and relative bias as criteria, the optimal range for r was 5 to 7 population members encountered from each start point. Sample size was best if n {$>$} 20, but returns in estimation quality diminished by n = 40. Transect width was previously uninvestigated and found to be the most important design factor affecting estimation quality. Field studies should strive for transects as wide as logistically reasonable. Published in 2005 by John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {Wood borers and bark beetles are among the most serious forest pests worldwide. Many such species have become successful invaders, often causing substantial, costly damages to forests. Here we design and evaluate the cost-efficiency of a trap-based surveillance program for early detection of wood borers and bark beetles at risk of establishing in New Zealand. Although costly, a surveillance program could lead to earlier detection of newly established forest pests, thereby increasing the likelihood of successful eradication and reducing control costs and damages from future invasions. We develop a mechanistic bioeconomic model that relates surveillance intensity (i.e., trap density) and invasion size to probabilities of detection and control. It captures the dynamics of invasive species establishment, spread, and damages to urban and plantation forests. We employ the model to design surveillance programs that provide the greatest net present benefits. Our findings suggest that implementing a surveillance trapping program for invasive wood borers and bark beetles would provide positive net benefits under all scenarios considered. The economically optimal trapping strategy calls for a very high investment in surveillance: about 10 000 traps in each year of the 30-year surveillance program, at a present value cost of US\$54 million. This strategy provides a 39\% reduction in costs compared with no surveillance, corresponding to an expected net present benefit of approximately US\$300 million. Although surveillance may provide the greatest net benefits when implemented at relatively high levels, our findings also show that even low levels of surveillance are worthwhile: the economic benefits from surveillance more than offset the rising costs associated with increasing trapping density. Our results also show that the cost-efficiency of surveillance varies across target regions because of differences in pest introduction and damage accumulation rates across locales, with greater surveillance warranted in areas closer to at-risk, high-value resources and in areas that receive more imported goods that serve as an invasion pathway.},

  abstract = {We used data on number of carcasses of wildlife species sold in 79 bushmeat markets in a region of Nigeria and Cameroon to assess whether species composition of a market could be explained by anthropogenic pressures and environmental variables around each market. More than 45 mammal species from 9 orders were traded across all markets; mostly ungulates and rodents. For each market, we determined median body mass, species diversity (game diversity), and taxa that were principal contributors to the total number of carcasses for sale (game dominance). Human population density in surrounding areas was significantly and negatively related to the percentage ungulates and primates sold in markets and significantly and positively related to the proportion of rodents. The proportion of carnivores sold was higher in markets with high human population densities. Proportion of small-bodied mammals ({$<$}1 kg) sold in markets increased as human population density increased, but proportion of large-bodied mammals ({$>$}10 kg) decreased as human population density increased. We calculated an index of game depletion (GDI) for each market from the sum of the total number of carcasses traded per annum and species, weighted by the intrinsic rate of natural increase (r(max)) of each species, divided by individuals traded in a market. The GDI of a market increased as the proportion of fast-reproducing species (highest r(max)) increased and as the representation of species with lowest r(max) (slow-reproducing) decreased. The best explanatory factor for a market's GDI was anthropogenic pressureroad density, human settlements with {$>$}3000 inhabitants, and nonforest vegetation. High and low GDI were significantly differentiated by human density and human settlements with {$>$}3000 inhabitants. Our results provided empirical evidence that human activity is correlated with more depleted bushmeat faunas and can be used as a proxy to determine areas in need of conservation action. Correlaciones entre los Mercados de Carne de Animales Silvestres y la Disminucion de la Vida Silvestre Usamos datos numericos de carcasas de especies de vida silvestre vendidas en 79 mercados de carne de animales silvestres, en una region de Nigeria y Camerun, para evaluar si la composicion de especies de un mercado puede explicarse por medio de presiones antropogenicas y variables ambientales alrededor de cada mercado. Mas de 45 especies de mamiferos de nueve ordenes fueron vendidas en todos los mercados, la mayoria ungulados y roedores. Para cada mercado determinamos el promedio de masa corporal, diversidad de especies (diversidad de presa) y taxones que principalmente contribuyeron al numero total de carcasas en venta (dominancia de presa). La densidad de poblacion humana en las areas colindantes estuvo negativa y significativamente relacionada con el porcentaje de ungulados y primates vendidos en los mercados y positiva y significativamente relacionada con la proporcion de roedores. La proporcion de carnivoros vendidos fue mas alta en los mercados con altas densidades de poblacion humana. La proporcion de mamiferos de pequeno tamano ({$<$} 1kg) vendidos en los mercados se incremento conforme se incrementaba la densidad de poblacion humana, pero la proporcion de mamiferos de gran tamano ({$>$} 10kg) disminuyo conforme aumento la densidad de poblacion humana. Calculamos un indice de disminucion de presas (IDP) para cada mercado, a partir de la suma del numero total de carcasas vendidas por ano y especie, sopesado por la tasa intrinseca de incremento natural (r(max)) de cada especie, dividida por el numero de individuos vendidos en un mercado. El IDP de un mercado se incremento conforme lo hizo la proporcion de especies de rapida reproduccion (r(max) mas alta) y conforme disminuyo la representacion de especies con la r(max) mas baja (de baja reproduccion). El mejor factor explicativo para el IDP de un mercado fue la presion antropogenica - densidad de carreteras, asentamientos humanos con mas de 3000 habitantes y vegetacion no boscosa. Los IDP altos y bajos fueron significativamente diferenciados por la densidad humana y los asentamientos humanos con mas de 3000 habitantes. Nuestros resultados proporcionaron evidencia empirica de que la actividad humana esta correlacionada con la disminucion de especies cazadas y puede usarse como indicador para determinar areas que necesiten acciones de conservacion.

  abstract = {Background The principle that a single large habitat patch should hold more species than several small patches totalling the same area (SL {$>$} SS) is used by conservation agencies to favour protection of large, contiguous areas. Previous reviews of empirical studies have found the opposite, SS {$>$} SL, creating the single large or several small (SLOSS) debate. Aims Review the empirical and theoretical SLOSS literature; identify potential mechanisms underlying the SS {$>$} SL pattern; evaluate these where possible. Location Global. Time period 1976–2018. Major taxa Plants, invertebrates, vertebrates. Methods Literature review. Results Like previous reviews, I found that SS {$>$} SL dominates empirical findings. This pattern remained, although it was somewhat weakened, in studies where sampling intensity was proportional to patch size. I found six classes of theory, and conducted five preliminary evaluations of theory. None of the predictions was supported. The SS {$>$} SL pattern held for specialist species groups, suggesting it does not result from incursion by generalists into small patches. I found no evidence for the prediction that the reverse pattern (SL {$>$} SS) becomes more common over time since patch creation, through gradual species losses from SS. I found no difference between results for natural and anthropogenic patches. There was also no evidence for predictions that SL {$>$} SS is more common when the matrix is more hostile, or for stable than ephemeral patches. Main conclusions Most empirical comparisons find SS {$>$} SL. While there are several potential causes, more empirical work is needed to identify those at play. Meanwhile, conservation practitioners should understand that there is no ecological evidence supporting a general principle to preserve large, contiguous habitat areas rather than multiple small areas of the same total size.},

Significant variation was found in number of species exploited, but ungulates constituted 73.2\% of all hunted animals. Rodents and primates contributed 12.2\% and 12.0\%, respectively. Large-bodied species (15.0–99.9 kg) represented over half (54.4\%) of the total hunted biomass. Most species were snared, and were generally medium-sized, fast, terrestrial, frugivore–herbivores. By species, we showed using meta-analysis, that abundance was the main predictor of harvest level. But, the relationship between hunter presence (calculated as average hunter numbers operating per 100 days) and hunter ease (an index of catchability of the hunted fauna) and site harvest levels was shown to be significant only for hunter ease. Site harvest rates were higher in areas with more hunter presence. Overall, an average of 2000 carcasses (16,000 kg in weight) per site was extracted in a year. Per hunter, this amounted to 200 carcasses (1000 kg) extracted. Such amounts fall within reported unsustainable harvest levels of the mammalian fauna in African forests.},

When choosing camera models, practitioners often consider camera trigger speed to be one of the most important factors to maximise species detections. However, factors such as detection zone will also influence detection probability. As part of a rabbit eradication program, we performed a pilot study to compare rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) detections using the Reconyx PC900 (faster trigger speed, narrower detection zone) and the Ltl Acorn Ltl-5310A (slower trigger speed, wider detection zone). Contrary to our predictions, the slower-trigger-speed cameras detected rabbits more than twice as often as the faster-trigger-speed cameras, suggesting that the wider detection zone more than compensated for the relatively slower trigger time. We recommend context-specific field trials to ensure cameras are appropriate for the required purpose. Missed detections could lead to incorrect inferences and potentially misdirected management actions.},

  abstract = {Aim A common assumption in fire ecology and management is that landscapes with a greater diversity of fire-ages will support a greater diversity of animal species (i.e. ‘pyrodiversity begets biodiversity’). This assumption is based on the idea that landscapes with a more diverse fire history provide a greater array of post-fire habitats, leading to a greater number of species within the landscape. We assessed the hypothesis that pyrodiversity begets biodiversity by enhancing community differentiation (b diversity), resulting in increased landscape-scale richness (c-diversity). We used reptiles as a case-study.},

By sharing biological parameters, integrated models improve the accuracy and precision of estimates compared to separate analyses of individual data sets. We developed an integrated point process model to combine presence-only and distance sampling data for estimation of spatially explicit abundance patterns. Simulations across a range of parameter values demonstrate that our model can recover estimates of biological covariates, but parameter accuracy and precision varied with the quantity of each data type. We applied our model to a case study of black-backed jackals in the Masai Mara National Reserve, Kenya, to examine effects of spatially varying covariates on jackal abundance patterns. The model revealed that jackals were positively affected by anthropogenic disturbance on the landscape, with highest abundance estimated along the Reserve border near human activity. We found minimal effects of landscape cover, lion density, and distance to water source, suggesting that human use of the Reserve may be the biggest driver of jackal abundance patterns. Our integrated model expands the scope of ecological inference by taking advantage of widely available presence-only data, while simultaneously leveraging richer, but typically limited, distance sampling data.},

  abstract = {Reducing uncertainty in forest carbon estimates at local and regional scales has become increasingly important due to the centrality of the terrestrial carbon cycle in issues of climate change. Despite relatively limited geographical extent, temperate forests are among the most carbon dense forests in the world. Estimates of carbon in key understorey life forms and belowground components of these forests have often been excluded from previous studies in south-eastern Australia. We estimated above- and belowground carbon stocks (including soil to 0.3 m depth) in stands of cool temperate rainforest (‘rainforest’), wet sclerophyll forest (‘eucalypt forest’), and mixed rainforest–wet sclerophyll stands (‘ecotone forest’) across a wide range of environmental conditions and forest structures. We examined relationships among component carbon stocks and a range of environmental variables (edaphic, climatic, spatial) and present the first allometric equations and carbon stock estimates for south-eastern Australian tree ferns. Component carbon stocks were within the range of published values for these stand types. Using multivariate analyses of all component stocks, we detected significantly more carbon in total above- and belowground components in ecotone (697 Mg haÀ1, 95\% confidence interval 575–819 Mg haÀ1) and eucalypt forests (689 Mg haÀ1, 605–773 Mg haÀ1) than rainforest (550 Mg haÀ1, 453–647 Mg haÀ1). However, we found no significant differences among the stand types in the proportional distribution of carbon among components despite significant differences in structural composition as indicated by size class distributions of the main genera. Of total carbon, \$48\% was stored in trees ({$>$}2 cm over-bark diameter), and \$72\% of tree carbon was stored in the largest 10\% of all trees. The most important environmental variables associated with carbon stocks irrespective of stand type were edaphic variables, most commonly total and available soil nitrogen. Tree fern carbon was the only component stock more strongly associated with climatic and spatial than edaphic variables. Our findings indicate that disturbance mediated changes in stand dynamics could significantly alter total carbon stocks, particularly if more frequent fires limit tree recruitment and increase large tree mortality. Monitoring of these forests for carbon could place greater emphasis on key structural elements associated with the largest proportion of total carbon, the largest trees. By reducing uncertainties associated with estimates of carbon in key stocks, we can better understand potential future changes to the carbon cycle from altered stand dynamics under climate change.},

  abstract = {Light detection and ranging (lidar) data have been increasingly used for forest classification due to its ability to penetrate the forest canopy and provide detail about the structure of the lower strata. In this study we demonstrate forest classification approaches using airborne lidar data as inputs to random forest and linear unmixing classification algorithms. Our results demonstrated that both random forest and linear unmixing models identified a distribution of rainforest and eucalypt stands that was comparable to existing ecological vegetation class (EVC) maps based primarily on manual interpretation of high resolution aerial imagery. Rainforest stands were also identified in the region that have not previously been identified in the EVC maps. The transition between stand types was better characterised by the random forest modelling approach. In contrast, the linear unmixing model placed greater emphasis on field plots selected as endmembers which may not have captured the variability in stand structure within a single stand type. The random forest model had the highest overall accuracy (84\%) and Cohen’s kappa coefficient (0.62). However, the classification accuracy was only marginally better than linear unmixing. The random forest model was applied to a region in the Central Highlands of south-eastern Australia to produce maps of stand type probability, including areas of transition (the ‘ecotone’) between rainforest and eucalypt forest. The resulting map provided a detailed delineation of forest classes, which specifically recognised the coalescing of stand types at the landscape scale. This represents a key step towards mapping the structural and spatial complexity of these ecosystems, which is important for both their management and conservation.},

  abstract = {Many applied problems in ecology and conservation require prediction, and population models are important tools for that purpose. Formerly, the majority of predictive population models were based on matrix models. As the limitations of classical matrix models have become clearer, the use of individual-based models has increased. These models use behavioral rules imposed at the level of the individual to establish the emergent consequences of those rules at the population level. Individual behaviors in such models use an array of different rule types, from empirically derived probabilities to long-term fitness considerations. There has been surprisingly little discussion of the strengths and weaknesses of these different rule types. Here, we consider different strategies for modeling individual behaviors, together with some problems associated with individual-based models. We propose a novel approach based on modeling optimal annual routines. Annual routines allow individual behaviors to be predicted over a whole annual cycle within the context of long-term fitness considerations. Temporal trade-offs between different behaviors are automatically included in annual routine models, overcoming some of the primary limitations of other individual-based models. Furthermore, as well as population predictions, individual behaviors and indices of condition are emergent features of annual routine models. We show that these can be more sensitive to environmental change than population size, offering alternative, repeatable metrics for monitoring population status. Annual routine models provide no panacea for the problems of data limitations in predictive population modeling. However, as a result of their ability to deal with life-history trade-offs, as well as their potential for relatively rapid and accurate validation and parameterization, we suggest that annual routine models have strong potential for predictive population modeling in applied conservation settings.},

Systematic survey designs are often used to reduce the true variability among different realizations of the design, but estimating the variance is difficult and estimators typically approximate the variance by treating the design as a simple random sample of lines. We explore the properties of different encounter rate variance estimators under random and systematic designs. We show that a design-based variance estimator improves upon the model-based estimator of Buckland et al. (2001, Introduction to Distance Sampling. Oxford: Oxford University Press, p. 79) when transects are positioned at random. However, if populations exhibit strong spatial trends, both estimators can have substantial positive bias under systematic designs. We show that poststratification is effective in reducing this bias.},

  abstract = {In spatial surveys for estimating the density of objects in a survey region, systematic designs will generally yield lower variance than random designs. However, estimating the systematic variance is well known to be a difficult problem. Existing methods tend to overestimate the variance, so although the variance is genuinely reduced, it is over-reported, and the gain from the more efficient design is lost. The current approaches to estimating a systematic variance for spatial surveys are to approximate the systematic design by a random design, or approximate it by a stratified design. Previous work has shown that approximation by a random design can perform very poorly, while approximation by a stratified design is an improvement but can still be severely biased in some situations. We develop a new estimator based on modeling the encounter process over space. The new “striplet” estimator has negligible bias and excellent precision in a wide range of simulation scenarios, including strip-sampling, distance-sampling, and quadrat-sampling surveys, and including populations that are highly trended or have strong aggregation of objects. We apply the new estimator to survey data for the spotted hyena (Crocuta crocuta) in the Serengeti National Park, Tanzania, and find that the reported coefficient of variation for estimated density is 20\% using approximation by a random design, 17\% using approximation by a stratified design, and 11\% using the new striplet estimator. This large reduction in reported variance is verified by simulation.},

  abstract = {Background: Wildlife populations are difficult to monitor directly because of costs and logistical challenges associated with collecting informative abundance data from live animals. By contrast, data on harvested individuals (e. g., age and sex) are often readily available. Increasingly, integrated population models are used for natural resource management because they synthesize various relevant data into a single analysis. Methodology/Principal Findings: We investigated the performance of integrated population models applied to black bears (Ursus americanus) in Minnesota, USA. Models were constructed using sex-specific age-at-harvest matrices (1980-2008), data on hunting effort and natural food supplies (which affects hunting success), and statewide mark-recapture estimates of abundance (1991, 1997, 2002). We compared this approach to Downing reconstruction, a commonly used population monitoring method that utilizes only age-at-harvest data. We first conducted a large-scale simulation study, in which our integrated models provided more accurate estimates of population trends than did Downing reconstruction. Estimates of trends were robust to various forms of model misspecification, including incorrectly specified cub and yearling survival parameters, age-related reporting biases in harvest data, and unmodeled temporal variability in survival and harvest rates. When applied to actual data on Minnesota black bears, the model predicted that harvest rates were negatively correlated with food availability and positively correlated with hunting effort, consistent with independent telemetry data. With no direct data on fertility, the model also correctly predicted 2-point cycles in cub production. Model-derived estimates of abundance for the most recent years provided a reasonable match to an empirical population estimate obtained after modeling efforts were completed. Conclusions/Significance: Integrated population modeling provided a reasonable framework for synthesizing age-at-harvest data, periodic large-scale abundance estimates, and measured covariates thought to affect harvest rates of black bears in Minnesota. Collection and analysis of these data appear to form the basis of a robust and viable population monitoring program.},

When managing an economically valuable koala population, it shows that a decision based on alpha = 0.05 carries an expected cost over \$5 million greater than the optimal decision. For a species of such value, there is never any benefit in guarding against the spurious detection of declines and therefore management should proceed directly to recovery action. This result holds in most circumstances where the species' value substantially exceeds its recovery costs. For species of lower economic value, we show that the conventional alpha-level of 0.05 rarely approximates the optimal decision-making threshold. This analysis supports calls for reversing the statistical `burden of proof' in environmental decision-making when the cost of Type II errors is relatively high.},

Ensuring that limited resources are allocated efficiently requires evaluation of statistical power for alternative survey designs. We simulated the process of data collection on a landscape, where we initiated declines over 3 sample periods in species of varying prevalence and detectability. Changing occupancy levels were estimated using a technique that accounted for effects of false-negative errors on survey data. Declines were identified within a frequentist statistical framework, but the significance level was set at an optimal level rather than adhering to an arbitrary conventional threshold. By varying the number of sites sampled and repeat visits made, we show how managers can design an optimal monitoring regime that maximizes statistical power within fixed budget constraints. Results show that 2 to 3 visits/site are generally sufficient unless occupancy is very high or detectability is low. In both cases, the number of required visits increase. In an example of woodland bird monitoring in the Mt. Lofty Ranges, South Australia, we show that, although the budget required to monitor a relatively rare species of low detectability may be higher than that for a common, easily detectable species, survey design requirements for common species may be more stringent. We discuss implications for multi-species monitoring programs and application of our methods to more complex monitoring problems.},

Regular aerial surveys of macropods across large areas of Australia's arid and semi-arid rangelands were established as a response to concerns for the species' conservation. They became integral to the harvest management of the four macropod species - Eastern Grey Kangaroo (Macropus giganteus), Western Grey Kangaroo (M. fuliginosus), Red Kangaroo (Osphranter rufus) and Common Wallaroo (O. robustus). Harvest quotas are set as a proportion of population size, requiring absolute estimates of abundance. Counts were made in strip transects from fixed-wing aircraft, but required correction for animals that are missed. In New South Wales and Queensland, counts are now made using line transect sampling, providing survey-specific correction. Helicopters are used in more rugged and timbered areas and where Common Wallaroo can be more frequently found and harvested. Mark-recapture distance sampling is used in more open country that can be surveyed using fixed-wing aircraft and improves the accuracy of density estimates by accounting for animals missed on the transect line. Macropod populations are likely to be surveyed in the future by airborne imagery and by drones, but the technology needs further development. Spatial models could usefully provide small-scale density estimates and address non-random sampling.},

CPC and FPC are the proportion of ground area covered by the vertical projection of tree crowns, and the foliage of tree crowns, respectively. They are dimensionless proportions that vary between zero and one. The relationship between CPC and FPC is a function of the plant area index (PAI), the foliage clumping factor at a zenith angle of zero, the foliage projection function at a zenith angle of zero, tree stand density, mean crown radii, and the proportion of wood to all canopy elements (alpha). The non-linear relationship was investigated using a dataset of 745 field sites across Australia, for which 1003 coincident CPC and FPC measurements had been made. As measurements of LAI and the other variables were not available, the parameter k was introduced to simplify the equations, which then had only two unknowns: a and k. Best-fit values of a and k were determined using non-linear weighted least-squares regression across all the field sites. Using these values to predict FPC from CPC, and vice versa, achieved low root mean square errors (0.05-0.07) across the field data. The models allow different mapping products to be compared, and also have the potential to facilitate the derivation of FPC from airborne lidar data when field measurements of FPC are not available for calibration. This was demonstrated using a lidar dataset and 12 coincident field sites, across which FPC was derived from a lidar fractional cover metric with an RMSE of 0.08. Further research is required to investigate the stability of this method across different areas and lidar systems.},

  abstract = {Accurate abundance estimates of plant populations are fundamental to numerous ecological questions and for conservation. Estimating population parameters for rare or cryptic plant species, however, can be challenging and thus developing and testing new methods is useful. We assessed the efficacy of distance sampling for estimating abundance and habitat associations of the endangered Pima pineapple cactus (Coryphantha scheeri var. robustispina), a rare plant in the Sonoran Desert of southwestern North America that has traditionally been surveyed with census-based methods. Distance sampling (DS) involves measuring distances between focal objects and samples of lines or points, and modeling detection functions that adjust estimates for variation in detection probability (P). Although often used in animal systems, DS remains largely untested for plants. We encountered 105 live individuals along 36.9 km of transects in 11 study plots placed across much of the geographic range of the species, and estimated an average density of 1.47 individuals/ha (CV = 0.139). Compared to values from intensive censuses, density estimates from DS were underestimated by only 2.3\% on average and highly correlated on the untransformed (r = 0.84) and logarithmic (r = 0.93) scales. Estimates of P averaged 0.49 and declined as soils became increasingly dominated by larger soil substrates, and somewhat with increasing vegetation volume and decreasing cactus height. Local densities increased with increasing slope and soil substrate size and decreased with increasing vegetation volume (P {$<$}= 0.024). Combined with careful survey design, DS offers an efficient method for estimating population parameters for uncommon and cryptic plants.},

  abstract = {Spotlighting (SL) is used widely to estimate animal abundance, but it yields density estimates that are underestimated and biased. Introduction of distance sampling has, to a large extent, contributed to solving these problems, but the reliability of this statistical method depends strongly on sample size. Thermal infrared (TI) imaging may improve number of observations, but very few studies have quantified performance of TI imaging relative to SL. This comparison is relevant because the high cost of a TI device is justified only by a significant increase of observations and a consequent reduction of labor costs. Our objectives were to compare animal detectability by SL and TI imaging as a function of animal size, species (red deer [Cervus elaphus], fallow deer [Dama dama], wild boar [Sus scrofa], red fox [Vulpes vulpes], European rabbit [Oryctolagus cuniculus], and brown hare [Lepus europaeus]), distance, and season. We also analyzed group size and composition for red deer and effect of grass height on detection of hares and rabbits. On average, TI imaging was more efficient (P{$<$}0.001) than SL, which detected only 53.8\% of the animals observed by TI imaging. This was especially true for wild boar (92.1\%), but both devices observed comparable red fox (P=0.60) and fallow deer (P=0.72) numbers. Relative detectability of the 2 devices was influenced by different factors: for red deer, TI was more efficient than SL in summer and autumn, but not in winter; male groups of red deer were better observed by TI imaging than by SL; and wild boars were better imaged at short (0-100-m) distances with TI. Relative effectiveness of both instruments was not influenced by grass height(P=0.92). Our results showed that wild boar should only be surveyed using TI imager and that a strong improvement of sample size can be obtained using TI for red deer, brown hare, and European rabbit.},

The Italian roe deer Capreolus capreolus italicits was recently confirmed to be a subspecies in Mediterranean habitats of central and southern Italy. We have monitored this subspecies at Castelporziano, near Rome, since 1988, and detected an abrupt population decline in 2001. We compared distance sampling surveys undertaken before and after the population crash to determine the ability of this method to detect variations in animal density and to investigate which factors may influence the precision of the estimates. We used radio tagged roe deer to evaluate the accuracy of our surveys, comparing distance sampling and mark-resight estimates at the same site, and studying the behavioural reaction of the animals to the presence of an observer. We found that before the crash distance sampling surveys attained a good precision but that the survey conditions influenced both precision and accuracy. Post-crash surveys were less precise, but the difference in density, before and after the crash was highly significant, indicating the potential of the method to quickly detect density variations and so to allow wildlife managers to react without delay to a crisis. The direct test of distance sampling assumptions showed that estimates were almost unbiased. We conclude that the methodology was successful for monitoring this population and that it may be used in other situations where ungulates are rare and efficient monitoring must be attained with restricted budgets.},

  abstract = {Hunted wild animals (i.e., bushmeat) are a main source of protein for many rural populations in the tropics, and the unsustainable harvest of these animals puts both human food security and ecosystem functioning at risk. To understand the correlates of bushmeat consumption, we surveyed 1219 households in 121 rural villages near three newly established national parks in Gabon. Through the surveys we gathered information on bushmeat consumption, income, and material assests. In addition, we quantified land cover in a 5-km radius around the village center and distance of the village center to the nearest park boundary. Bushmeat was not a source of income for most households, but it was the primary animal protein consumed. Ninety-seven percent of households consumed bushmeat at least once during a survey period of 12 days. Income or wealth, land cover, distance of village to the nearest park boundary, and level of education of the head of the household were among the factors that significantly related to the likelihood of consuming any of the 10 most commonly consumed species of bushmeat. Household size was the predictor most strongly associated with quantities of bushmeat consumed and was negatively related to consumption. Total bushmeat consumption per adult male equivalent increased as household wealth increased and decreased as distance of villages to park boundaries increased. Bushmeat consumption at the household level was not related to unit values (i.e., price estimates for a good that typically does not have a market value; estimates derived from willingness to sell or trade the good for items of known price) of bushmeat or the price of chicken and fish as potential substitutes. The median consumption of bushmeat at the village level, however, was negatively related to village mean unit values of bushmeat across all species. Our results suggest that a lack of alternative protein sources motivated even the wealthiest among surveyed households to consume bushmeat. Providing affordable, alternative protein sources to all households would likely reduce unsustainable levels of bushmeat consumption in rural Gabon.},

  abstract = {Point counts are one of the most widely used and efficient approaches to survey land-bird populations. A new approach to point-count surveys involves the use of 2 observers, which allows the calculation of a detection probability for each bird species. Detection probabilities derived from 2 observers permit investigators to calculate a corrected abundance estimate that accounts for birds present but not detected. We evaluated 2 double-observer point count approaches: the dependent-observer approach and the independent-observer approach. The dependent-observer approach involves 2 observers recording data together on a single data sheet with one observer designated the primary observer and the other designated as the secondary observer. The primary observer verbally dictates the number of each species detected while the secondary observer records this information; the secondary observer also records birds that the primary observer did not detect. The independent-observer approach involves 2 observers recording data independently on separate data sheets without verbal communication between observers. This study compares the detection probabilities and associated levels of precision generated by both double-observer approaches to ascertain which technique generates data that are more accurate and more feasible to apply in the field. We conducted point counts at 137 point locations in northern West Virginia during the spring of 2000 and 2001 using both double-observer approaches. We generated detection probabilities and abundances from data collected using both double-observer approaches using program DOBSERV. The dependent-observer approach resulted in higher observer-specific and joint detection probabilities, as well as lower standard errors of detection probability across most cover types. Species-specific detection probabilities were higher across all cover types under the dependent-observer approach. Given the higher detection probabilities and associated precision combined with fewer logistical constraints, we suggest that the dependent-observer approach be used when investigators are interested in surveying birds using point counts.}

Three different types of subsampling designs (random, systematic and systematic-cluster) with small sample sizes (50 and 64 points), obtained from this larger data set (200 points), are evaluated. The sensitivity of the spatial methods in the detection and the reconstruction of spatial patterns following the application of the various subsampling designs is discussed. We find that the type of sampling design plays an important role in the capacity of autocorrelation coefficients to detect significant spatial autocorrelation, and in the ability to accurately reconstruct spatial patterns by kriging. Sampling designs that contain varying sampling steps, like random and systematic-cluster designs, seem more capable of detecting spatial structures than a systematic design.},

  abstract = {Conservation of Neotropical game species must take into account the livelihood and food security needs of local human populations. Hunting management decisions should therefore rely on abundance and distribution data that are as representative as possible of true population sizes and dynamics. We simultaneously applied a commonly used encounter-based method and an infrequently used sign-based method to estimate hunted vertebrate abundance in a 48,000-km2 indigenous landscape in southern Guyana. Diurnal direct encounter data collected during three years along 216, four-kilometer -long transects consistently under-detected many diurnal and nocturnal mammal species readily detected through sign. Of 32 species analyzed, 31 were detected by both methods; however, encounters did not detect one and under-detected another 12 of the most heavily hunted species relative to sign, while sign under-detected 12 never or rarely collected species relative to encounters. The six most important game animals in the region, all ungulates, were not encountered at 11–40\% of village and control sites or on 29–72\% of transects where they were detected by sign. Using the sign methodology, we find that tapirs, one of the terrestrial vertebrates considered most sensitive to overexploitation, are present at many sites where they were never visually detected during distance sampling. We find that this is true for many other species as well. These high rates of under-detection suggest that behavioral changes in hunted populations may affect apparent occurrence and abundance of these populations. Accumulation curves (detection of species on transects) were much steeper for sign for 12 of 16 hunted species than for encounters, but that pattern was reversed for 12 of 16 species unhunted in our area. We conclude that collection of sign data is an efficient and effective method of monitoring hunted vertebrate populations that complements encounter and camera-trapping methods in areas impacted by hunting. Sign surveys may be the most viable method for large-scale, management-oriented studies in remote areas, particularly those focused on community-based wildlife management.},

  abstract = {We used distance sampling to assess density and the detectability of male black grouse ( Tetrao tetrix) and rock ptarmigan ( Lagopus muta) in 2 protected areas of the Italian Alps. Our sampling effort was not sufficient to provide reliable inference for monitoring projects. Therefore, we used our field results to structure a simulation study to compare the performance of plot-based and distance sampling estimators of density. These 2 methods have different assumptions: plot sampling assumes a perfect detection of animals within the surveyed plots, whereas distance sampling assumes a decrease in detectability as the distance between observer and animal increases. The density and the detectability conditions adopted in the simulation were designed to be similar to those observed in our 2 studies, whereas the spatial patterns presumed for the simulated populations described a wide range of possible scenarios. Sampling points were allocated according to both random and stratified distributions. Simulation results showed that plot sampling underestimated density with bias invariably greater than 30\% and confidence intervals with coverage lower than the nominal level of 95\%. Conversely, distance sampling estimators provided bias levels invariably smaller than those obtained using plot sampling and bootstrap confidence intervals with empirical coverage near to or greater than 95\%. Based on our simulations, the distance sampling estimator was superior to the plot sampling estimator for these grouse species on our study areas in terms of precision and accuracy and the stratified allocation was superior to the random allocation. However, distance sampling would be very costly to implement. Based on our simulations, 4-5 points per km2 would be necessary to achieve reliable estimates of density and density changes. If distance sampling cannot be completed at this intensity, other sampling methods should be adopted. © 2014 The Wildlife Society.},

Since then, several census methods have been proposed and tested, but all methods still pose logistical or statistical difficulties. We conducted computer simulations using actual tortoise location data front 2 1-mi(2) plot surveys in southern California, USA, to identify strengths and weaknesses of current sampling strategies. We considered tortoise population estimates based oil these plots as “truth” and then tested various sampling methods based oil sampling smaller plots or transect lines passing through the mile squares. Data were analyzed using Schnabel's mark-recapture estimate and program CAPTURE. Experimental subsampling with replacement of the 1-mi(2) data using 1-km(2) and 0.25-km(2) plot boundaries produced data sets of smaller plot sizes, which we compared to estimates front the 1-mi(2) plots. We also tested distance sampling by saturating a 1-mi(2) site with computer simulated transect lines, once again evaluating bias ill density estimates. Subsampling estimates from 1-km(2) plots did not differ significantly front the estimates derived at 1-mi(2). The 0.25-km(2) subsamples significantly overestimated population sizes, chiefly because too few recaptures were made. Distance sampling simulations Were biased 80\% of the time and had high coefficient of variation to density ratios. Furthermore, a prospective power analysis suggested limited ability to detect population declines as high as 50\%. We concluded that poor performance and bias of both sampling procedures was driven by insufficient sample Size, suggesting that all efforts must be directed to increasing numbers found in order to produce reliable results.

  abstract = {Structural analysis of forests by UAV is currently growing in popularity. Given the reduction in platform costs, and the number of algorithms available to analyze data output, the number of applications has grown rapidly. Forest structures are not only linked to economic value in forestry, but also to biodiversity and vulnerability issues. LiDAR remains the most promising technique for forest structural assessment, but small LiDAR sensors suitable for UAV applications are expensive and are limited to a few manufactures. The estimation of 3D-structures from two-dimensional image sequences called ‘Structure from motion’ (SfM) overcomes this limitation by photogrammetrically reconstructing point clouds similar to those rendered from LiDAR sensors. The result of these techniques in highly structured terrain strongly depends on the methods employed during image acquisition, therefore structural indices might be vulnerable to misspecifications in flight campaigns. In this paper, we outline how image overlap and ground sampling distances affect image reconstruction completeness in 2D and 3D. Higher image overlaps and coarser GSDs have a clearly positive influence on reconstruction quality. Therefore, higher accuracy requirements in the GSD must be compensated by a higher image overlap. The best results are achieved with an image overlap of {$>$} 95\% and a resolution of {$>$} 5 cm. The most important environmental factors have been found to be wind and terrain elevation, which could be an indicator of vegetation density.},

We present six direct count methods conducted in a communal area of the Zambezi Valley, Zimbabwe, and compare them in terms of (1) effort and cost to survey an area (sampling efficiency), and (2) efficiency in data collection (detection efficiency). Methods ranged from c.US\$0.2 to over US\$6.0/km(2) and needed from 0.1 to 5.0 human-h/km(2). The comparison of efficiencies showed the advantages of simple ground methods: foot counts and particularly bicycle counts appear well adapted to the ecological and human context of our study. The relative benefits and constraints of the different methods are discussed in the context of a community-based wildlife management programme.},

  abstract = {Camera-traps are increasingly used to survey threatened mammal species and are an important tool for estimating habitat occupancy. To date, cost-efficient occupancy survey effort allocation studies have focused on tradeoffs between number of sample units (SUs) and sampling occasions, with simplistic accounts of associated costs which do not reflect camera-trap survey realities. Here we examine camera-trap survey costs as a function of the number of SUs, survey duration and camera-traps per SU, linking costs to precision in occupancy estimation. We evaluate survey effort trade-offs for hypothetical species representing different levels of occupancy (psi) and detection (p) probability to identify optimal design strategies. We apply our cost function to three threatened species as worked examples. Additionally, we use an extensive camera-trap data set to evaluate independence between multiple camera traps per SU. The optimal number of sampling occasions that result in minimum cost decrease as detection probability increases, irrespective of whether the species is rare (psi {$<$} 0.25) or common (psi {$>$} 0.5). The most expensive survey scenarios occur for elusive (p {$<$} 0.25) species with a large home range ({$>$}10 km(2)), where the survey is conducted on foot. Minimum survey costs for elusive species can be achieved with fewer sampling occasions and multiple cameras per SU. Multiple camera-traps set within a single SU can yield independent species detections. We provide managers and researchers with guidance for conducting cost-efficient camera-trap occupancy surveys. Efficient use of survey budgets will ultimately contribute to the conservation of threatened and data deficient mammals. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Secondary forests are extensive in the tropics. Currently, these plant communities are the available habitats for wildlife and in the future they will possibly be some of the most wide-spread ecosystems world-wide. To understand the potential role of secondary forests for wildlife conservation, three ungulate species were studied: Mazama temama, Odocoileus virginianus and Pecari tajacu. We analyzed their relative abundance and habitat use at two spatial scales: (1) Local, where three different successional stages of tropical deciduous forest were compared, and (2) Landscape, where available habitats were compared in terms of landscape composition (proportion of forests, pastures and croplands within 113 ha). To determine the most important habitat-related environmental factors influencing the Sign Encounter Rate (SER) of the three ungulate species, 11 physical, anthropogenic and vegetation variables were simultaneously analyzed through model selection using Akaike’s Information Criterion. We found, that P. tajacu and O. virginianus mainly used early successional stages, while M. temama used all successional stages in similar proportions. The latter species, however, used early vegetation stages only when they were located in landscapes mainly covered by forest (97\%). P. tajacu and O. virginianus also selected landscapes covered essentially by forests, although they required smaller percentages of forest (86\%). All ungulate species avoided landscape fragments covered by pastures. For all three species, landscape composition and human activities were the variables that best explained SER. We concluded that landscape is the fundamental scale for ungulate management, and that secondary forests are potentially important landscape elements for ungulate conservation.},

Despite the evidence that many flora and fauna species have detection probabilities of less than one, it is still the default assumption of most environmental impact assessment processes that if a species is present, it will be detected. Here we briefly review a number of existing studies that have estimated the survey effort necessary to detect animal species, based on what is known about their detection rates in standard surveys. We then propose a novel method, based on failure-time analysis, for quantifying the detectability of and determining appropriate survey effort for plant species during flora surveys. We provide computer code for implementing the method in the Bayesian freeware WinBUGS. Methods for estimating detectability can be used to inform minimum survey requirements and have important applications in environmental impact assessment and monitoring.},

  abstract = {Illegal use of natural resources is a threat to biodiversity globally, but research on illegal activities has methodological challenges. We examined 100 studies that empirically identify targeted resources, techniques used to procure resources illegally, locations of illegal activities, characteristics of typical violators, incentives driving illegal use of resources, magnitude of the problem of illegal use (e. g., quantities used), or frequency of illegal activity. We based our evaluation of the methods used in these studies on their ability to provide these empirical data, relative labor demands, training and technology requirements, and levels of uncontrollable bias. We evaluated eight different methods: law-enforcement records, indirect observation, self-reporting, direct observation, direct questioning, randomized response technique (a survey method designed to improve accuracy of responses to sensitive questions), forensics, and modeling. Different situations favored different methods, each with distinct advantages and limitations. Six context-specific factors-location of resource use (in situ vs. ex situ), budget, technology and training capacity, ease of detection of illegal activity, scope of illegal activity (limited vs. widespread), and researchers' willingness to accept bias in results-help narrow the choice of methods. Several methodological concerns applied to any study of illegal resource use: regular monitoring can detect trends; modeling can incorporate sampling error and data uncertainties; researchers must manage levels of bias that vary between methods; triangulation of results from multiple methods can improve accuracy. No method is a panacea, but a combination of techniques can help address the lack of data on illegal activity. Researchers empirically compared results from different methods in only four studies, and no one has compared more than two methods simultaneously. Conservation would benefit from more research focused on: methods comparisons that include cost effectiveness, time efficiency, and statistical rigor; unique applications of the eight techniques currently in use; and testing of new methods.},

  abstract = {Protected area coverage has reached over 15\% of the global land area. However, the quality of management of the vast majority of reserves remains unknown, and many are suspected to be "paper parks". Moreover, the degree to which management can be enhanced through targeted conservation projects remains broadly speculative. Proven links between improved reserve management and the delivery of conservation outcomes are even more elusive. In this paper we present results on how management effectiveness scores change in protected areas receiving conservation investment, using a globally expanded database of protected area management effectiveness, focusing on the "management effectiveness tracking tool" (METT). Of 1934 protected areas with METT data, 722 sites have at least two assessments. Mean METT scores increased in 69.5\% of sites while 25.1\% experienced decreases and 5.4\% experienced no change over project periods (median 4 years). Low initial METT scores and longer implementation time were both found to positively correlate with larger increases in management effectiveness. Performance metrics related to planning and context as well as monitoring and enforcement systems increased the most while protected area outcomes showed least improvement. Using a general linear mixed model we tested the correlation between change in MEIT scores and matrices of 1) landscape and protected area properties (i.e. topography and size), 2) human threats (i.e. road and human population density), and 3) soda-economics (i.e. infant mortality rate). Protected areas under greater threat and larger protected areas showed greatest improvements in MET. Out results suggest that when funding and resources are targeted at protected areas under greater threat they have a greater impact, potentially including slowing the loss of biodiversity.

  abstract = {This book discusses a broad range of statistical design and analysis methods that are particularly well suited to pollution data. It explains key statistical techniques in easy-to-comprehend terms and uses practical examples, exercises, and case studies to illustrate procedures. Dr. Gilbert begins by discussing a space-time framework for sampling pollutants. He then shows how to use statistical sample survey methods to estimate average and total amounts of pollutants in the environment, and how to determine the number of field samples and measurements to collect for this purpose. Then a broad range of statistical analysis methods are described and illustrated. These include:  determining the number of samples needed to find hot spots analyzing pollution data that are lognormally distributed testing for trends over time or space estimating the magnitude of trends comparing pollution data from two or more populations  New areas discussed in this sourcebook include statistical techniques for data that are correlated, reported as less than the measurement detection limit, or obtained from field-composited samples. Nonparametric statistical analysis methods are emphasized since parametric procedures are often not appropriate for pollution data. This book also provides an illustrated comprehensive computer code for nonparametric trend detection and estimation analyses as well as nineteen statistical tables to permit easy application of the discussed statistical techniques. In addition, many publications are cited that deal with the design of pollution studies and the statistical analysis of pollution data. This sourcebook will be a useful tool for applied statisticians, ecologists, radioecologists, hydrologists, biologists, environmental engineers, and other professionals who deal with the collection, analysis, and interpretation of pollution in air, water, and soil.},

  abstract = {Preservation of biodiversity is a central goal of conservation management, yet the conditions that promote persistence may differ for the species in the community. For systems subject to stochastic disturbances such as fire, understanding which management practices promote persistence for all species in a community is complex. Before deciding on the best course of action, an objective must be specified. Yet an overarching goal of species persistence can be specified into a measureable objective many different ways. We investigated four alternative management objectives for maximizing species persistence that use common biodiversity indices: (1) attaining the minimally acceptable mix of successional vegetation states to support species’ relative abundances, (2) maximizing the arithmetic mean abundance of species, (3) maximizing the geometric mean abundance of species, and (4) minimizing the average extinction risk of species. We used stochastic dynamic programming to model successional changes in vegetation in the presence of both planned and unplanned fires, and utilize an extensive data set on the occurrence of birds, reptiles, and small mammals in different successional states in semiarid Australia. We investigated the influence the choice of objective function and taxonomic focus has on the optimal fire management recommendations. We also evaluated a recent hazard reduction policy to annually burn a fixed amount of the landscape and compare results to the optimal solution. The optimal management strategy to maximize species persistence over a 100-year period is predominantly to minimize wildfires. This is because the majority of species are more likely to occur in intermediate and late successional vegetation. However the optimal solution showed sensitivity to the objective and the species included in the analysis. These results highlight the need for careful consideration when specifying an objective to represent overarching conservation goals. Using the extinction risk objective, we show that a policy to annually burn 5\% of the landscape could increase the average probability of extinction for the modelled species by 7\% over the next 100 years compared to the optimal management scenario.},

  abstract = {Understanding how land-use changes affect different facets of plant biodiversity in seminatural European grasslands is of particular importance for biodiversity conservation. As conclusions of previous experimental or synchronic observational studies did not converge toward a general agreement, assessing the recent trends in vegetation change in various grassland systems using a diachronic approach is needed. In this resurvey study, we investigated the recent changes in grassland vegetation of the French Jura Mountains, a region with a long tradition of pastoralism. We compared the floristic composition of 150 grassland plots recorded between 1990 and 2000 with new releves made in 2012 on the same plots. We considered taxonomic, phylogenetic and functional diversity as well as ecological characteristics of the plant communities derived from ecological indicator values and life strategies of the species. PCA of the floristic composition revealed a significant general trend linked to the sampling year. Wilcoxon paired tests showed that contemporary communities were generally more dominated by grass species and presented a higher tolerance to defoliation, a higher pastoral value, and a higher nutrient indicator value. Comparisons revealed a decrease in phylogenetic and functional diversity. By contrast, local species richness has slightly increased. The intensity of change in species composition, measured by Hellinger distance between pairs of releves, was dependent on neither the time lag between the two surveys, the author of the first releve nor its location or elevation. The most important changes were observed in grasslands that previously presented low pastoral value, low grass cover, low tolerance to defoliation, and high proportion of stress-tolerant species. This trend was likely linked to the intensification of grassland management reported in the region, with a parallel increase in mowing frequency, grazing pressure, and fertilization level. More restrictive specifications should be applied to agricultural practices to avoid overexploitation of mountain species-rich grasslands and its negative consequences on their biodiversity and resilience.},

Visibility varies substantially in forests depending on stand type, age and understorey vegetation. In such conditions distance sampling would be an efficient estimation method, but observer disturbance often results in bias when the method is applied to deer. 3. The performance of thermal imaging for estimating deer density by distance sampling was assessed in seven forest deer populations. Thermal imaging equipment can detect the long-wave energy. radiated by natural objects, clearly revealing warm-bodied animals even if partly obscured by vegetation. 4. Many more deer were detected at night using a thermal imager than along the same transect routes in daytime. Detection distances were correlated with visibility but were substantially longer than the average distances at which most animals were disturbed. Most deer were detected without causing prior disturbance. 5. Densities were estimated with a coefficient of variation ranging from 10.2-28.4\%. Precision depended on sampling effort and sample sizes obtained. 6. A Monte Carlo simulation revealed a quadratic relationship between accuracy and visibility, with accuracy increasing with average visibility and a tendency for deer to select more open habitats within a forest. Under conditions that are likely to be typical of temperate forests ({$<$}40\% thicket and neutral selection, or {$<$}70\% thicket if thicket is avoided), accuracy was generally good and changed relatively little in relation to visibility and habitat selection. 7. Likely sources of bias as well as alternatives to thermal imaging are discussed. It is concluded that the method would be suitable for estimating ungulate densities in forests with an adequate network of tracks.},

Statistical ecology has gelled over the past decade as a discipline that moves away from describing patterns towards modelling the ecological processes that generate these patterns. Following the fourth International Statistical Ecology Conference (1–4 July 2014) in Montpellier, France, we analyse current trends in statistical ecology. Important advances in the analysis of individual movement, and in the modelling of population dynamics and species distributions, are made possible by the increasing use of hierarchical and hidden process models. Exciting research perspectives include the development of methods to interpret citizen science data and of efficient, flexible computational algorithms for model fitting.

I explore resource efficient survey designs based on a negative binomial distribution including variable survey intervals for marine turtles using track counts as an index of female activity. In the modified procedure, all new tracks between two monitoring patrols are recorded. These data are analyzed by statistical models that take advantage of the statistical properties of the sum of counts. The outputs of models with different lagged monitoring dates (3-10 days) are compared with the outputs of daily surveys using extrapolations from high and low density populations. Results show that the quality of the estimates is similar when total time series analysis is compared with situations in which only a fourth, a seventh, or a tenth of monitoring daily during the season are used. This solution permits the reallocation of funds from monitoring to other conservation activities. Furthermore, the efficient sampling design and the statistical methods allow getting similar information with less effort.},

However, the performance of distance-sampling abundance estimates has seldom been evaluated for wild mammal populations of known size.Aims. We evaluated the precision, accuracy, bias and interval coverage of abundance estimates from walked line-transect sampling, a commonly used distance-sampling method, for a marked free-ranging population of eastern grey kangaroos (Macropus giganteus) at Yanakie Isthmus, Wilsons Promontory National Park, south-eastern Australia.Methods. In each of two study periods (November 2012 and May 2013) we first determined the true size of the uniquely marked kangaroo population by conducting 10 intensive searches of the study area. We then conducted distance sampling along six systematically spaced line transects. We walked each transect four times in November 2012 and seven times in May 2013. Data were analysed using Program DISTANCE.Key results. Our intensive searches revealed that 141 and 124 collared kangaroos were present in the study area in November 2012 and May 2013, respectively. When transects were walked four or more times (i.e. ≥400 observations), maximum precision (coefficient of variation; CV of ∼13\%) was achieved in both survey periods. Walking transects twice (i.e. ∼200 observations) produced abundance estimates with CVs of {$<$}20\% in each study period. The accuracy (root mean square error) of abundance estimates varied from 1 to 13 (November 2012) and from 3 to 28 (May 2013). Bias ranged from −9\% to 23\%, but stabilised at between −1\% and −9\% when transects were walked four or more times in each study period. The 95\% confidence intervals for the abundance estimates always included the true population size.Conclusions. Our results indicated that walked line-transect distance sampling is a precise and accurate method for estimating eastern grey kangaroo abundance. The small negative biases that occurred when sample sizes were large were likely to be due to some animals moving outside the study area.Implications. Provided that the key design elements and assumptions are met, estimates of kangaroo abundance from walked line-transect distance sampling should have good precision (CV {$<$} 20\%) and minimal ({$<$}10\%) bias.},

  abstract = {Vegetation cover and composition are two indicators commonly used to monitor terrestrial ecosystems. These indicators are currently quantified with a number of different methods. The interchangeability and relative benefits of different methods have been widely discussed in the literature, but there are few published comparisons that address multiple criteria across a broad range of grass- and shrub-dominated communities, while keeping sampling effort (time) approximately constant. This study compared the utility of three field sampling methods for ecological assessment and monitoring: line-point intercept, grid-point intercept, and ocular estimates. The criteria used include: (1) interchangeability of data, (2) precision, (3) cost, and (4) value of each method based on its potential to generate multiple indicators. Foliar cover by species was measured for each method in five plant communities in the Chihuahuan Desert. Line- and grid-point intercept provide similar estimates of species richness which were lower than those based on ocular estimates. There were no differences in the precision of the number of species detected. Estimates of foliar cover with line- and grid-point intercept were similar and significantly higher than those based on ocular estimates. Precision of cover estimates with line-point intercept was higher than for ocular estimates. Time requirements for the three methods were similar, despite the fact that the point-based methods included cover estimates for all canopy layers and the soil surface, while the ocular estimates included only the top canopy layer. Results suggest that point-based methods provide interchangeable data with higher precision than ocular estimates. Moreover these methods can be used to generate a much greater number of indicators that are more directly applicable to a variety of monitoring objectives, including soil erosion and wildlife habitat.

This study aimed to develop an effective approach for long-term monitoring of the yellow-bellied glider (Petaurus australis) in north-east New South Wales. We conducted repeat surveys to account for imperfect detection and used counts in abundance modelling to produce indices of abundance. We used simulations to explore refinements to our study design. Surveys over three consecutive years produced 195 detections with {$>$}95\% of detections by call. The probability of detection varied across years and survey occasions, ranging from 0.22 to 0.71. Abundance estimates were remarkably constant across years, ranging from 2.3 ± 0.5 to 2.4 ± 0.6 individuals per site. Occupancy estimates were also constant across years (0.90–0.91). Simulations were run to investigate the influence of the number of surveys (2 or 3) and the number of survey sites (20, 40 or 50) on the probability of occupancy. The design that reduced bias and provided an adequate improvement to precision was that of three visits to 40 survey sites. This design should be adequate to detect a decline in population abundance. Further studies of this kind are needed to better understand the population dynamics of this species.},

Monitoring and mapping of land cover and land cover change in a consistent and robust manner over large areas is made possible with Earth Observation (EO) data. Land cover products satisfying a range of science and policy information needs are currently produced periodically at different spatial and temporal scales. The increased availability of EO data—particularly from the Landsat archive (and soon to be augmented with Sentinel-2 data)—coupled with improved computing and storage capacity with novel image compositing approaches, have resulted in the availability of annual, large-area, gap-free, surface reflectance data products. In turn, these data products support the development of annual land cover products that can be both informed and constrained by change detection outputs. The inclusion of time series change in the land cover mapping process provides information on class stability and informs on logical class transitions (both temporally and categorically). In this review, we present the issues and opportunities associated with generating and validating time-series informed annual, large-area, land cover products, and identify methods suited to incorporating time series information and other novel inputs for land cover characterization.},

The authors find that the ESA's process for determining whether a species is endangered or threatened is subjective and often leads to incorrect determinations. The condition of 32.6\% of listed species is declining and for 30.6\%, it is unknown. The ESA has failed to lead to the recovery of endangered or threatened species. Only two species, the Aleutian Canada goose, Brandta canadensis leucopareia, and the Virginia round-leafbirch, Betula uber, can be considered as having been reclassified from endangered to threatened primarily because of the ESA. However, in both instances, the beneficial management practices could have been conducted under other existing authorities. More than half of the species which are considered to have reached 75\% or more of their recovery objectives have reached that point for reasons other than the successful implementation of the ESA. Vertebrate species clearly receive a disproportionate share of funding. Expenditure reports reveal that expenditures by governmental agencies other than the primary implementing agencies, the USFWS and the National Marine Fisheries Service account for the majority of federal expenditures.

However, it is also considered an agricultural pest. This study aimed to identify the main environmental, human, and landscape variables influencing the European hare density, and to build density maps in the reproductive and non-reproductive seasons of 2016 and 2017 in the Pampas region. We performed spotlight counts at night and estimated its density using density surface models (DSMs). During the non-reproductive season, we found more individuals in the proximity to the Mar Chiquita Biosphere Reserve and tree plantations; and areas near towns and low accessibility (low road density). While during the reproductive season, we found significantly more European hares in heterogeneous environments, such as areas with smaller crop fields, and with higher mean productivity. In both seasons, we found a significant effect of the geographic coordinates. Based on the best models, we predicted a total abundance of 39,034 and 33,373 European hares, in the non-reproductive and reproductive season respectively. Our results revealed that disturbance by human activities and landscape configuration influenced the spatial variation of European hare density. In this study, by combining land-use changes using remote sensing products, GIS, and considering imperfect detection with distance sampling, we provided an accurate spatial European hare density estimation, which is crucial to develop integrative management programs.},

Additionally, two new variants and their estimators are introduced to the existing pool. Simulations are used to determine the efficiency of competing protocols and associated estimators. The simulation results corroborate the theoretical unbiasedness of the estimators for PDS in all forms. In addition, while there is some difference in variance among the protocols, the overall difference is small, and depends on the attribute to be estimated. Therefore, the choice of which PDS variant to use in field applications will depend on the field conditions and attributes to be estimated.},

We investigated the relation between bushmeat hunting and household wealth and protein consumption in 2 rural communities in Bioko Island, Equatorial Guinea. One village was dedicated to commercial hunting, the other trapped game primarily for food. We tested whether commercial-hunter households were nutritionally advantaged over subsistence-hunter households due to their higher income from the bushmeat trade and greater access to wild-animal protein. We conducted bushmeat-offtake surveys in both villages (captures by hunters and carcasses arriving to each village). Mammals (including threatened primates: black colobus [Colobus satanas], Preussi's guenon [Allochrocebus preussi], and russet-eared guenon [Cercopithecus erythrotis]), birds, and reptiles were hunted. The blue duiker (Philantomba monticola), giant pouched rat (Cricetomys emini), and brush-tailed porcupine (Atherurus africanus) contributed almost all the animal biomass hunted, consumed, or sold in both villages. Monkeys and Ogilbyi's duikers (Cephalophus ogilbyi) were hunted only by commercial hunters. Commercial hunters generated a mean of US\$2000/year from bushmeat sales. Households with commercial hunters were on average wealthier, generated more income, spent more money on nonessential goods, and bought more products they did not grow. By contrast, households with subsistence hunters spent less on market items, spent more on essential products, and grew more of their own food. Despite these differences, average consumption of vegetable protein and domestic meat and bushmeat protein did not differ between villages. Our results highlight the importance of understanding the socioeconomic and nutritional context of commercial and subsistence bushmeat hunting to correctly interpret ways of reducing their effects on threatened species and to enable the sustainable offtake of more productive taxa.},

Efforts to conserve and manage fox squirrels in the southeastern United States are constrained by difficulties in studying their populations because of low densities and low detectability. There is a need for an effective survey method to fill knowledge gaps on southeastern fox squirrel ecology. To address this need and to identify a cost-effective and reliable technique to survey and monitor southeastern fox squirrel populations, we compared four survey methods across seasons: live-trapping; camera-trapping; point counts; and line-transect surveys, in regard to whether a detection occurred at a survey point, the total number of detections at a survey point, and the total cost for each method. We assessed the effectiveness of capture and detection methods and the influence of seasonality using generalized linear mixed models. We found camera-trapping to be the most effective survey method for assessing the presence and distribution of southeastern fox squirrels. In total, camera-traps produced significantly more detections (n = 223) of fox squirrels than all other methods combined (n = 84), with most detections occurring in spring (n = 97) and the fewest in the autumn (n = 60). Furthermore, we detected fox squirrels at more survey points with camera-traps (73\%) than all other methods (63\%), and we identified 16\% more individuals from camera-trap photographs than live-trapped. We recommend future monitoring of southeastern fox squirrels to be conducted using camera-trapping during the spring unless handling of animals is needed for other research purposes.},

  abstract = {Estimating the number of waterbird colonies in a given area can have important conservation implications, including assessment of the regional or global importance of an area and the impacts of conservation efforts (e. g., habitat restoration) and human disturbance (e. g., oil spills). Our objective was to examine differences in estimates of the number of waterbird colonies determined using strip-transect (ST) surveys, distance sampling, and adaptive cluster sampling (ACS), and to compare these estimates to the minimum number of known colonies (MNKC) obtained using point-to-point surveys. We conducted aerial surveys in May 2004 and May and June 2005 at two sites in southern Louisiana: the Atchafalaya Basin (AB), a large forested wetland, and the Barataria-Terrebonne estuary (BTE), a large coastal marsh with isolated clumps of woody vegetation suitable for nesting. In AB, we detected nine and eight colonies using the ACS and ST/distance sampling methods, respectively. Neither ACS estimator of number of colonies (Horvitz-Thompson and Hansen-Hurwitz) was within the 95\% confidence interval of the estimate determined from ST; ST estimated-two to three times more colonies than either ACS estimator. The MNKC for the AB was 33, well within the 95\% confidence interval of (Y) over cap by ST sampling. For the BTE, ACS estimators ((Y) over cap (HT) = 20.49, CI = 9.3-31.7; (Y) over cap (HH) = 14.15, CI = 2.3-26.0) were similar to the MNKC (20), whereas the ST ((Y) over cap = 87.94, CI = 82.9-92.9) and distance sampling ((Y) over cap = 60, CI = 31-113) methods produced much larger estimates. Our results suggest that the ACS method performed better when waterbird colonies were spatially clumped (BTE) and the ST method performed better in areas where colonies were more uniformly distributed (AB). Depending on management objectives, a complete, systematic survey of a study area may be required if the potential for missing large colonies is unacceptable. If surveying an area with no previous information about colony location or dispersion, we recommend a coarse-scale analysis of the availability and contiguity of habitat likely to contain waterbird colonies; this analysis will help determine the most appropriate survey method.},

  abstract = {Long-billed Curlews (Numenius americanus) are shorebirds of high conservation concern in North America. Populations have declined in the last 150 yr primarily due to habitat loss and conversion. We conducted a 2-yr study to estimate the density and statewide abundance of breeding Long-billed Curlews in Nebraska during 2008 and 2009. Surveys were conducted during the prenesting period in April when Long-billed Curlews were likely to be detected. We used a simple random sample of roadside survey routes (N= 39), each consisting of 40 5-min point-counts at 800-m intervals. We modeled detection probability and found that wind speed negatively affected detectability, but found no evidence of either year effects or observer bias. We estimated there were 0.0038 Long-billed Curlews per hectare (0.38 Long-billed Curlews per km2) along survey routes and, by extrapolation, estimated there were 23,909 (SE = 1685; 95\% CI: 20,81027,471) Long-billed Curlews in Nebraska. Our population estimate suggests that similar to 15 to 22\% of the United States population of Long-billed Curlews is found in Nebraska. Curlews were not evenly distributed within our survey area, with the highest densities in the central Sandhills, an area dominated by grass-stabilized sand dunes and shallow wetlands, and the lowest densities in predominantly agricultural areas. Because Long-billed Curlews in Nebraska face many potential threats resulting from land-use changes, monitoring of the breeding population should be continued. Our survey method was efficient and yielded interpretable results; other states or regions should consider adopting this approach for estimating curlew abundance.},

The main target for these surveys has been the Iberian lynx, the most endangered cat in the world. The Iberian lynx conservation program has received the largest EU LIFE projects grant. So, efficiency is a key goal for managing this grant. During 2003 and 2007, we have applied these funds to the survey of the Iberian lynx in Eastern Sierra Morena (Spain). Using two different techniques, we have studied both to see which is the most efficient. The survey developed in active latrines resulted more efficient than that of scent stations and live prey camera trapping throughout the years, although there has been a variation between years. Otherwise, the live prey method has been the one providing the greatest speed and number of pictures per entrance. We suggest that camera-trapping surveys can be improved in terms of efficiency for a wide range of species, or at least for the Iberian lynx. To improve the results, cameras might be placed in relation to breeding territories. With this determinant, camera-trapping surveys would be shorter than 120 days. Finally, we suggest how those surveys for medium carnivores should be designed.},

Application of the technique to natural systems has focused on identifying appropriate scales to measure the dynamics of species as descriptors of community and ecosystem dynamics. However, ecosystem monitoring is often based not on assessing single species, but on species assemblages, functional groups, or habitat types. We asked whether the concept of CLSs based on dynamic interactions among species could be extended to examine interactions among habitat types and thus to identify optimal scales for observing habitat dynamics. A time series of three spatial maps of benthic habitats on a Caribbean coral reef was constructed from aerial photographs, Compact Airborne Spectrographic Imager (CASI) images, and IKONOS satellite images, providing the short time sequence required for this technique. We estimated the CLS based on the dynamics of three distinct habitat types: dense stands of seagrass, sparse stands of seagrass, and Montastrea patch reefs. Despite notable differences in the areal extent of and relative change in these habitats over the 21-year observation period, analyses based on each habitat type indicated a similar CLS of similar to 300 m. We interpret the consistency of CLSs among habitats to indicate that the dynamics of the three habitat types are linked. The results are encouraging, and they indicate that CLS techniques can be used to identify the appropriate scale at which to monitor ecosystem trends on the basis of the dynamics of only one of a disparate suite of habitat types.},

The story is one of major paradigmatic shifts with implications for the design and operation of similar programs worldwide. Since 1983, Australian Governments have approved the National Soil Conservation Program, the National Landcare Program, the Natural Heritage Trust, the National Action Plan for Salinity and Water Quality and a new program called Caring for Our Country. These programs have seen a transition from the early days of attitude change to the creation of new regional institutions and direct payment systems for environmental stewardship. Despite these advances recent audit reports have mirrored those from the United States and the Europe. They identify problems of ineffective targeting, monitoring and evaluation of expenditure. This paper considers the efficiency and effectiveness of alternative program designs in Australia. Two major design improvements are suggested: (a) systems for linking expenditure to outcomes and (b) adopting standardised metrics for valuing outcomes. This will permit the application of benefit-cost and cost-effectiveness analysis and, ultimately, improved returns on investment. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

To obtain such knowledge three questions, why, what, and how, must be answered before commencing any biodiversity survey. While the questions why and what are often value decisions and thus determined outside the realm of scientific research, the question about how the surveys are conducted lies in the heart of science. Here, we report an intensive repeated survey of wood-inhabiting fungi with the aim of determining the optimal timing and number of the surveys for reliable estimation of the diversity of this species group. The research focusing on the ecology of wood-inhabiting fungi has been increasing but little is known about the reliability of the methods. The variation in the estimates of diversity among surveys was high and the results varied between studied species groups. The site-scale detectability for species belonging to different groups varied from 10 to 95\% depending on the survey month and the species group. We conclude that because detectability of many fungi turned out to be poor even when surveys were conducted at an optimal time, the common practice of using a single fruit body survey to estimate fungal diversity of any given area is not enough. We suggest that multiple surveys at an optimal time should be a norm in fungal diversity studies. Improper methodology results in unreliable outcomes that have potential to hamper our goal of conserving the biological diversity.},

The Mitchell's satyr butterfly, Neonympha mitchellii mitchellii, is a federally endangered species found at 18 highly isolated sites in the Eastern USA. Currently, surveys are conducted by meandering through habitat and recording the number of butterflies observed. These surveys are efficient in terms of staffing and time, but the data from these surveys cannot be used to estimate abundance. Mark release recapture surveys generate estimates of demographic parameters and have been conducted, albeit infrequently, and require high staffing levels and weeks of fieldwork to generate estimates with reasonable error. 3. I employed hierarchical distance sampling along line transects to estimate N. m. mitchellii abundance at one site in lower Michigan, USA. This method requires one observer to traverse a series of transects at a walking pace and record the number of butterflies observed and their perpendicular distance to the transect line. My results suggest that this method is as cost efficient as meander surveys, but generates reasonable estimates of butterfly abundance.},

We first give an "entry-level" introduction to abundance estimation, including fundamental concepts and the importance of recognizing sources of bias and obtaining a measure of precision. Each of the primary methods available to estimate abundance of marine mammals is then described, including data collection and analysis, common challenges in implementation, and the assumptions made, violation of which can lead to bias. The main method for estimating pinniped abundance is extrapolation of counts of animals (pups or all-ages) on land or ice to the whole population. Cetacean and sirenian abundance is primarily estimated from transect surveys conducted from ships, small boats or aircraft. If individuals of a species can be recognized from natural markings, mark-recapture analysis of photo-identification data can be used to estimate the number of animals using the study area. Throughout, we cite example studies that illustrate the methods described. To estimate the abundance of a marine mammal population, key issues include: defining the population to be estimated, considering candidate methods based on strengths and weaknesses in relation to a range of logistical and practical issues, being aware of the resources required to collect and analyze the data, and understanding the assumptions made. We conclude with a discussion of some practical issues, given the various challenges that arise during implementation.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Climate change could therefore result in species range dynamics that reduce the relevance of current fixed protected areas in future conservation strategies. Here, we apply species distribution modeling and conservation planning tools in three regions (Mexico, the Cape Floristic Region of South Africa, and Western Europe) to examine the need for additional protected areas in light of anticipated species range shifts caused by climate change. We set species representation targets and assessed the area required to meet those targets in the present and in the future, under a moderate climate change scenario. Our findings indicate that protected areas can be an important conservation strategy in such a scenario, and that early action may be both more effective and less costly than inaction or delayed action. According to our projections, costs may vary among regions and none of the three areas studied will fully meet all conservation targets, even under a moderate climate change scenario. This suggests that limiting climate change is an essential complement to adding protected areas for conservation of biodiversity.}

  abstract = {In 1986, a small, outlying population of Leadbeater’s possum (Gymnobelideus leadbeateri) was discovered inhabiting lowland swamp forest at Yellingbo Nature Conservation Reserve. It is the only known extant lowland population, and occurs in habitat dramatically different to that throughout the possum’s core range in the montane ash forests of the Victorian Central Highlands. As part of an investigation into the species’ ecology in lowland swamp forest, surveys were undertaken to establish the possum’s distribution and abundance at Yellingbo. The population is estimated to contain 80 - 100 individuals, distributed along a narrow, 6 km length of riparian forest. Most of the suitable foraging habitat is presently occupied, and densities are similar to those previously reported for the species in montane ash forest. The possums are breeding year round, with significant recruitment of young into the population, and data obtained between 1995-2004 suggest that the population size is currently stable. A highly targeted revegetation program focused on the floodplain has the potential to improve up to 85 ha of degraded swamp forest, and in so doing would more than double the area of suitable habitat for G. leadbeateri in the reserve.},

Drawing on the conservation literature and our personal experience, we review whether such a one-size-fits-all approach is justifiable on scientific and practical grounds. We conclude that achieving a model biodiversity monitoring protocol suitable for use in all potential REDD+ sites is probably an unrealistic objective, owing to the huge differences among the world's forests in terms of structure, species composition, ecological interactions and ecosystem services provided. Moreover, to provide useful feedback for conservation managers, ecological monitoring programmes must be designed around a project's conservation goals, which will vary from project to project, owing to these differences in forest ecology and human threats faced. Thus, site-specific biodiversity monitoring programmes are needed. No single monitoring method is likely to be optimal, or even suitable for use, in all REDD+ forests. Instead, we suggest that a standard approach be adopted, in which ecological monitoring research is (i) designed to reflect a project's biodiversity conservation goals; (ii) based upon scientifically-tractable, policy-relevant questions regarding the impacts of management interventions on the ecosystem; (iii) founded on detailed knowledge of the habitat type in question; (iv) includes monitoring of a number of indicators, as appropriate to the project; and (v) defines appropriate reference/baseline conditions against which progress can be assessed.},

  abstract = {Mismatches in boundaries between natural ecosystems and land governance units often complicate an ecosystem approach to management and conservation. For example, information used to guide management, such as vegetation maps, may not be available or consistent across entire ecosystems. This study was undertaken within a single biogeographic region (the Murray Mallee) spanning three Australian states. Existing vegetation maps could not be used as vegetation classifications differed between states. Our aim was to describe and map ‘tree mallee’ vegetation consistently across a 104 000 km2 area of this region. Hierarchical cluster analyses, incorporating floristic data from 713 sites, were employed to identify distinct vegetation types. Neural network classification models were used to map these vegetation types across the region, with additional data from 634 validation sites providing a measure of map accuracy. Four distinct vegetation types were recognised: Triodia Mallee, Heathy Mallee, Chenopod Mallee and Shrubby Mallee. Neural network models predicted the occurrence of three of them with 79\% accuracy. Validation results identified that map accuracy was 67\% (kappa = 0.42) when using independent data. The framework employed provides a simple approach to describing and mapping vegetation consistently across broad spatial extents. Specific outcomes include: (1) a system of vegetation classification suitable for use across this biogeographic region; (2) a consistent vegetation map to inform land-use planning and biodiversity management at local and regional scales; and (3) a quantification of map accuracy using independent data. This approach is applicable to other regions facing similar challenges associated with integrating vegetation data across jurisdictional boundaries.},

  abstract = {Tree hollows are a critical, yet potentially limiting habitat resource for many animal species. Fire influences hollow availability, and the associated indirect effects on fauna can threaten the persistence of hollow-dependent species in fire-prone systems. We investigated the influence of two temporal aspects of fire regimes (time-since-fire, inter-fire interval) on hollow occurrence in a semi-arid, fire-prone region in south-eastern Australia. Empirical data on the characteristics of hollow-bearing eucalypt stems and fire-history attributes were compiled for 581 study sites. Mixed models were used to examine the relative influence of time-since-fire and inter-fire interval on hollow occurrence. Time-since-fire and interfire interval both affected the probability of hollow occurrence, but in different ways. Time-since-fire influenced the occurrence of hollows in live and dead stems. As time-since-fire increased, so too did the probability of live and dead stems containing hollows. Live stems did not provide hollows before 40 years post-fire, while the probability of dead stems containing hollows peaked at 50–60 years. Inter-fire interval influenced the availability of hollows in dead stems. Longer inter-fire intervals resulted in an increased density of dead hollow-bearing stems. In this region, hollow-dependent fauna will benefit from increased fire-free periods, both in terms of individual fire events and the intervals between repeated fires. These results highlight the complex way in which fire affects the availability of faunal habitat resources, and the extended time periods over which such influences operate. Understanding the effects of fire regimes on slow-developing habitat resources over long time-frames is imperative for sound ecological fire management.},

However, spatially varying environmental characteristics and land uses may affect more than just the probability of occurrence. Biodiversity or economic value, and the ease of detection and control are also likely to vary. We incorporate these factors into a detection and treatment model of a low-density invader to determine the surveillance strategy that minimizes expected management costs. Sites with a high probability of invader occurrence and great benefits associated with detection warrant intensive surveillance; however, the optimum investment is a nonlinear function of these factors. Environments where the invader is relatively easy to detect are prioritized for surveillance, although only a moderate investment is necessary to ensure a high probability of detection. Intensive surveillance effort may be allocated to other sites if the probability of occurrence, budget and ⁄ or expected benefits is sufficiently high.},

The success of using artificial retreats for monitoring is dependent on our ability to maximise detection and minimise variability in sightings within a sampling period. Because ectotherms use retreats for their thermal properties, it may be possible to identify weather conditions during which animals consistently use retreats and design a monitoring protocol based on optimal conditions. We investigated the use of artificial retreats by common skinks. Oligosoma polychroma, in mixed grassland habitat in southern New Zealand under various weather conditions and at a range of times of day. We recorded 1175 sightings of skinks during 1800 artificial retreat checks over a nine day period in early summer 2008. Ambient temperature, rainfall, humidity and time of day were the strongest predictors of skink sightings beneath retreats. Skink sightings were highest and least variable: (1) in an ambient temperature range of 12-18 degrees C, (2) during light or no rain, and (3) at low levels of relative humidity. Under optimal weather conditions, skink counts were similar during the day (8 a.m. to 5 p.m. inclusive) but lower during the evening (8 p.m.). Observer variability, type of substrate beneath the retreat and retreat colour did not significantly influence the number of skinks sighted. We highlight the need to optimise protocols for checking artificial retreats on a species- and site-specific basis before attempting to evaluate their use as a monitoring tool for herpetofauna.

  abstract = {Context Fertility control is seen as an attractive alternative to lethal methods for control of population size and genetic diversity in managed animal populations. Immunocontraceptive vaccines have emerged as the most promising agents for inducing long-term infertility in individual animals. However, after over 20 years of scientific testing of immunocontraceptive vaccines in the horse, the scientific consensus is that their application as a sole management approach for reducing population size is not an effective strategy. Aims The purpose of this review is to evaluate currently available non-lethal fertility-control methods that have been tested for their contraceptive efficacy in Equidae, and to assess their suitability for effective management of wild (feral) horses in an Australian setting. Key results (1) Fertility-control agents, particularly injectable immunocontraceptive vaccines based on porcine zona pellucida (PZP) or gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH), can induce multi-year infertility (up to 3 years) in the horse. Some formulations require annual or biennial booster treatments. Remote dart delivery (on foot) to horses is possible, although the efficacy of this approach when applied to large numbers of animals is yet to be determined. (2) The proportion of females that must be treated with a fertility-control agent, as well as the frequency of treatment required to achieve defined management outcomes (i.e. halting population growth in the short term and reducing population size in the long term) is likely to be {$>$}50\% per annum. In national parks, treatment of a large number of wild horses over such a broad area would be challenging and impractical. (3) Fertility control for wild horses could be beneficial, but only if employed in conjunction with other broad-scale population-control practices to achieve population reduction and to minimise environmental impacts. Conclusions In Australia, most populations of wild horses are large, dispersed over varied and difficult-to-access terrain, are timid to approach and open to immigration and introductions. These factors make accessing and effectively managing animals logistically difficult. If application of fertility control could be achieved in more than 50\% of the females, it could be used to slow the rate of increase in a population to zero (2–5 years), but it will take more than 10–20 years before population size will begin to decline without further intervention. Thus, use of fertility control as the sole technique for halting population growth is not feasible in Australia.},

Several different survey methods are available, and the choice of method depends on the species and study aims. Few studies have compared the accuracy and efficiency of different survey methods for large mammals, particularly for primates. Here we compare estimates of density and abundance of Kloss' gibbons (Hylobates klossii) using two of the most common survey methods: line transect distance sampling and triangulation. Line transect surveys (survey effort: 155.5 km) produced a total of 101 auditory and visual encounters and a density estimate of 5.5 gibbon clusters (groups or subgroups of primate social units)/km(2). Triangulation conducted from 12 listening posts during the same period revealed a similar density estimate of 5.0 clusters/km(2). Coefficients of variation of cluster density estimates were slightly higher from triangulation (0.24) than from line transects (0.17), resulting in a lack of precision in detecting changes in cluster densities of {$<$} 66 \% for triangulation and {$<$} 47 \% for line transect surveys at the 5 \% significance level with a statistical power of 50 \%. This case study shows that both methods may provide estimates with similar accuracy but that line transects can result in more precise estimates and allow assessment of other primate species. For a rapid assessment of gibbon density under time and financial constraints, the triangulation method also may be appropriate.},

The ultimate goal was an increase in tiger numbers to 1 individual/100 km(2) at each site. We predicted that improvements in law enforcement effectiveness would be followed by increases in prey numbers and, subsequently, tiger numbers. We used short-term and long-term indicators of success, including: (i) patrol team effort and effectiveness; (ii) catch per unit effort indicators (to measure reductions in threats); and (iii) changes in target species numbers. In addition to implementing a monitoring system, we focused on improving law enforcement management using an adaptive management process. Over 4 years, we noted clear increases in patrol effort and a partial reduction in threats. Although we did not detect clear trends in ungulate numbers, tiger populations remained stable or increased, suggesting that poaching of tigers may be more limiting than prey depletion. Increased effectiveness is needed before a clear reduction in threats can be noted, and more time is needed before detecting responses in target populations. Nonetheless, delineation of concrete goals and indicators of success provide a means of evaluating progress and weaknesses. Such monitoring should be a central component of law enforcement strategies for protected areas.},

  abstract = {The bush cricket Saga pedo is a critically endangered species in the EU and is included in Annex IV of Council Directive 92/43/EEC. This species is therefore subject to mandatory regular monitoring within all member countries where it occurs. Because its abundance is low and little information is available concerning its ecology, however, an effective monitoring method that would yield standardized results has yet to be devised. We found S. pedo passing through 6 instars during its development in Central European conditions. Our findings indicate that, after hatching, S. pedo moves constantly through terrain with optimal vegetation and thereby reduces its population density. Based on recaptures of marked individuals, adults moved usually between 0.5 and 2 m in 24 h, the largest distance moved during a day was recorded as 37.5 m. Combined with a high mortality rate, this continual movement leads to very low density late in the season. Based on extensive surveys conducted during 2006-2011 at 10 sites in the Palava Protected Landscape Area (Czech Republic), we show that the optimal time for monitoring in order to achieve comparable results from different investigators in different locations is the period just after nymphs hatch (1-10 May in Central Europe). Because S. pedo populations in Europe are threatened by habitat destruction resulting from successional overgrowth of habitat by vegetation and afforestation, ensuring the survival of this species will require that successional changes in vegetation and afforestation be stopped by mowing and removal of woody plants and seedlings or by farming (extensive grazing). Management need not be performed every year but should occur when the S. pedo population is already adult and dispersed. The most suitable period for partial machine mowing (1/3-1/2 of a specific area) is September. Mowing with scythes and extensive rotational grazing are the best methods for managing sites where S. pedo is found.},

  abstract = {A ground-based scanning lidar (light detection and ranging) system was evaluated to assess its potential utility for tree-level forest mensuration data extraction. Ground-based-lidar and field-mensuration data were collected for two forest plots: one located within a red pine (Pinus resinosa Ait.) plantation and another in a mixed deciduous stand dominated by sugar maple (Acer saccharum Marsh.). Five lidar point cloud scans were collected from different vantage points for each plot over a 6-h period on 5 July 2002 using an Optech Inc. ILRIS-3D laser imager. Fieldvalidation data were collected manually over several days during the same time period. Parameters that were measured in the field or derived from manual field measures included (i) stem location, (ii) tree height, (iii) stem diameter at breast height (DBH), (iv) stem density, and (v) timber volume. These measures were then compared with those derived from the ILRIS-3D data (i.e., the lidar point cloud data). It was found that all parameters could be measured or derived from the data collected by the ground-based lidar system. There was a slight systematic underestimation of mean tree height resulting from canopy shadow effects and suboptimal scan sampling distribution. Timber volume estimates for both plots were within 7\% of manually derived estimates. Tree height and DBH parameters have the potential for objective measurement or derivation with little manual intervention. However, locating and counting trees within the lidar point cloud, particularly in the multitiered deciduous plot, required the assistance of field-validation data and some subjective interpretation. Overall, ground-based lidar demonstrates promise for objective and consistent forest metric assessment, but work is needed to refine and develop automatic feature identification and data extraction techniques.},

Three wildlife sanctuaries of the Bangladesh Sundarbans are typical examples of protected areas where detection and monitoring of threats is difficult due to low densities of patrol staff and low frequency of patrolling relative to the area that requires monitoring. The aim of this study was to use camera traps to quantify: 1) the levels of different types of illegal human activities (IHA), 2) spatio-temporal variation in illegal human activities, and 3) what proportion of camera trap records can be used to identify perpetrators. Each photograph was categorized as either illegal human activity (IHA) or legal human activity (LHA) based on interpretation of the particular human activity and equipment observed in photograph. For IHA, infraction type was based on the Bangladesh Wildlife (Conservation and Security) Act 2012. A total of 914 unique human activity events were recorded (872 IHA and 42 LHA) in camera trap photos over a total of 1039 trap nights. The best model suggests that during spring tide 91\% of camera trapped locations in the West Sanctuary had IHA occurring in them during the survey period, while 84\% and 74\% locations had IHA in the South Sanctuary and East Sanctuary respectively. Camera trapping in remote areas can potentially help protected area managers to increase rates of detection of IHA in their conservation landscapes and increase rates of arrests and prosecutions by providing appropriate supporting evidence.

We tested it by simulation, and used it to estimate densities of Maxwell's duikers (Philantomba maxwellii) in Tai National Park, Cote d'Ivoire. 3. Densities estimated from simulated data were unbiased when we assumed animals were not available for detection during long periods of rest. Estimated duiker densities were higher than recent estimates from line transect surveys, which are believed to underestimate densities of forest ungulates. 4. We expect these methods to provide an effective means to estimate animal density from camera trapping data and to be applicable in a variety of settings.},

  abstract = {Biologists have repeatedly rediscovered classical models from physics predicting collision rates in an ideal gas. These models, and their two-dimensional analogues, have been used to predict rates and durations of encounters among animals or social groups that move randomly and independently, given population density, velocity, and distance at which an encounter occurs. They have helped to separate cases of mixed-species association based on behavioural attraction from those that simply reflect high population densities, and to detect cases of attraction or avoidance among conspecifics. They have been used to estimate the impact of population density, speeds of movement and size on rates of encounter between members of the opposite sex, between gametes, between predators and prey, and between observers and the individuals that they are counting. One limitation of published models has been that they predict rates of encounter, but give no means of determining whether observations differ significantly from predictions. Another uncertainty is the robustness of the predictions when animal movements deviate from the model’s assumptions in specific, biologically relevant ways. Here, we review applications of the ideal gas model, derive extensions of the model to cover some more realistic movement patterns, correct several errors that have arisen in the literature, and show how to generate confidence limits for expected rates of encounter among independently moving individuals. We illustrate these results using data from mangabey monkeys originally used along with the ideal gas model to argue that groups avoid each other. Although agent-based simulations provide a more flexible alternative approach, the ideal gas model remains both a valuable null model and a useful, less onerous, approximation to biological reality.},

Some of the most vulnerable ecosystems to human-increased fire frequency are old-growth               Araucaria araucana               forests of the southern Andes. We investigated the effects of wildfires on the density and richness of a lizard community in these ecosystems, considering fire frequency and elapsed time since last fire. During the 2018/2019 southern summer season, we conducted 71 distance sampling transects to detect lizards in Araucaria forests of Chile in four fire “treatments”: (1) unburned control, (2) long-term recovery, (3) short-term recovery, and (4) burned twice. We detected 713 lizards from 7 species. We found that the density and richness of lizards are impacted by wildfire frequency and time of recovery, mediated by the modification of habitat structure. The lizard community varied from a dominant arboreal species (               L. pictus               ) in unburned and long-recovered stands, to a combination of ground-dwelling species (               L. lemniscatus               and               L. araucaniensis               ) in areas affected by two fires. Araucaria forests provided key habitat features to forest reptiles after fires, but the persistence of these old-growth forests and associated biodiversity may be threatened given the increase in fire frequency.},

  abstract = {Underwater visual census (UVC) is the most common approach for estimating diversity, abundance and size of reef fishes in shallow and clear waters. Abundance estimation through UVC is particularly problematic in species occurring at low densities and/or highly aggregated because of their high variability at both spatial and temporal scales. The statistical power of experiments involving UVC techniques may be increased by augmenting the number of replicates or the area surveyed. In this work we present and test the efficiency of an UVC method based on diver towed GPS, the Tracked Roaming Transect (TRT), designed to maximize transect length (and thus the surveyed area) with respect to diving time invested in monitoring, as compared to Conventional Strip Transects (CST). Additionally, we analyze the effect of increasing transect width and length on the precision of density estimates by comparing TRT vs. CST methods using different fixed widths of 6 and 20 m (FW3 and FW10, respectively) and the Distance Sampling (DS) method, in which perpendicular distance of each fish or group of fishes to the transect line is estimated by divers up to 20 m from the transect line. The TRT was 74\% more time and cost efficient than the CST (all transect widths considered together) and, for a given time, the use of TRT and/or increasing the transect width increased the precision of density estimates. In addition, since with the DS method distances of fishes to the transect line have to be estimated, and not measured directly as in terrestrial environments, errors in estimations of perpendicular distances can seriously affect DS density estimations. To assess the occurrence of distance estimation errors and their dependence on the observer’s experience, a field experiment using wooden fish models was performed. We tested the precision and accuracy of density estimators based on fixed widths and the DS method. The accuracy of the estimates was measured comparing the actual total abundance with those estimated by divers using FW3, FW10, and DS estimators. Density estimates differed by 13\% (range 0.1–31\%) from the actual values (average = 13.09\%; median = 14.16\%). Based on our results we encourage the use of the Tracked Roaming Transect with Distance Sampling (TRT+DS) method for improving density estimates of species occurring at low densities and/or highly aggregated, as well as for exploratory rapid-assessment surveys in which divers could gather spatial ecological and ecosystem information on large areas during UVC.},

In 1999, the basic design, with a focus on sampling the whole of the designated intertidal was created, and sampling was conducted for sessile species and large mobile invertebrates by point-intercept sampling of vertical transects and band surveys along transects, respectively. In 2002 and 2003, the same types of sampling were conducted, but quadrat sampling for small mobile invertebrates was added and then modified. This project has produced basic data on the presence, abundance, and spatial distribution of substrates and intertidal biota. Additionally, statistical power analyses conducted on the biological data have allowed assessment of the ability of the sampling to detect trends in the abundance of the predominant species. Current sampling has an 80 percent probability to detect +10 percent annual changes in abundance of all targeted species with an α = 0.05; the ability to detect –10 percent trends is not as uniformly high. Various options are discussed for decreasing the spatial variance of the data. The information presented provides a basis for discussion of the major questions being asked, how the sampling design might be reconfigured to be consistent in approach, and how the intertidal monitoring should interface with other potential intertidal monitoring.},

In two national parks, where GIS-based monitoring systems were in place, in the course of 2006, data were standardised and analysed in the same way. Encounters on patrol with illegal activities and large mammals were corrected for patrol effort and the size of the area to enable comparing encounter rates in different protected areas. In December 2005, law-enforcement performance was evaluated in six protected areas. Through dissemination of the evaluation report, the poor performance of patrol staff and high levels of illegal activity in five out of six sites entered the public domain, and created a spirit of competition between protected areas. The present evaluation showed that in the course of 2006, in the six sites evaluated, patrol performance improved by 59\% on average, compared to only 11\% in the two parks that were not evaluated. In the four savannah sites evaluated, poaching was reduced by 72\%, but only by 17\% in the two forest sites evaluated. This compares with a reduction in poaching of 33\% in the two parks. Patrol data were open to several types of error. Although reliability of patrol data was checked at different hierarchical levels, the final check was at headquarters in Accra, comparing seasonal fluctuations in large-mammal encounters with those in two control areas.

  abstract = {The primary objective of the Monitoring of Illegal Killing of Elephants (MIKE) programme is to monitor worldwide trends in elephant poaching. MIKE has been employing in its analyses the proportion of illegally killed elephants (PIKE) as a relative indicator of poaching levels. PIKE is subject to a number of potential biases that need to be understood to assess the validity of inferences made from analyses based on it. In four well-managed sites (Queen Elizabeth and Murchison Falls in Uganda, and Mole and Kakum in Ghana), a pilot study was carried out to examine the on-site reliability of PIKE. The detection probability of elephant carcasses was examined in relation to visibility (habitat types) on patrol, and PIKE results were compared with the results of a catch per unit effort (C/E) analysis. Due to sharply increased patrol coverage in three out of four sites, by 2011, the detection probability of elephant carcasses approached 1. PIKE, based on verified field data corrected for detection probability, compared well with data from the carcass sheets in the MIKE database. C/E results provided support for the on-site use of PIKE. Because the relationship between the C/E index and law-enforcement effort varied by site, which makes pooling of data complicated, for MIKE's purposes C/E analysis was not considered a practical tool with which to monitor worldwide elephant poaching. PIKE data on the other hand can be easily pooled, and the pooling may erode away some of its imperfections. PIKE was found to be superior to C/E analysis for a system like MIKE.},

Estimating the density from grouped data can be challenging. In this paper we propose a kernel density estimator of wildlife population density for such grouped data. Our method uses a combined cross-validation and smoothed bootstrap approach to select the optimal bandwidth for grouped data. Our simulation study shows that with the smoothing parameter selected with this method, the estimated density from grouped data matches the true density more closely than with other approaches. Using smoothed bootstrap, we also construct bias-adjusted confidence intervals for the value of the density at the boundary. We apply the proposed method to two grouped data sets, one from a wooden stake study where the true density is known, and the other from a survey of kangaroos in Australia.},

  abstract = {1. Faecal surveys are used widely to study variations in abundance and distribution of forest-dwelling mammals when direct enumeration is not feasible. The utility of faecal indices of abundance is limited, however, by observational bias and variation in faecal disappearance rates that obscure their relationship to population size. We developed methods to reduce variability in faecal surveys and improve reliability of faecal indices. 2. We used double-observer transect sampling to estimate observational bias of faecal surveys of Roosevelt elk Cervus elaphus roosevelti and Columbian black-tailed deer Odocoileus hemionus columbianus in Olympic National Park, Washington, USA. We also modelled differences in counts of faecal groups obtained from paired cleared and uncleared transect segments as a means to adjust standing crop faecal counts for a standard accumulation interval and to reduce bias resulting from variable decay rates. 3. Estimated detection probabilities of faecal groups ranged from {$<$} 0.2-1.0 depending upon the observer, whether the faecal group was from elk or deer, faecal group size, distance of the faecal group from the sampling transect, ground vegetation cover, and the interaction between faecal group size and distance from the transect. 4. Models of plot-clearing effects indicated that standing crop counts of deer faecal groups required 34\% reduction on flat terrain and 53\% reduction on sloping terrain to represent faeces accumulated over a standard 100-day interval, whereas counts of elk faecal groups required 0\% and 46\% reductions on flat and sloping terrain, respectively. 5. Synthesis and applications. Double-observer transect sampling provides a cost-effective means of reducing observational bias and variation in faecal decay rates that obscure the interpretation of faecal indices of large mammal abundance. Given the variation we observed in observational bias of faecal surveys and persistence of faeces, we emphasize the need for future researchers to account for these comparatively manageable sources of bias before comparing faecal indices spatially or temporally. Double-observer sampling methods are readily adaptable to study variations in faecal indices of large mammals at the scale of the large forest reserve, natural area, or other forested regions when direct estimation of populations is problematic.},

For biomes, protection ranges from 4\% to 25\%, with six of 14 biomes still below the 10\% level. Geographic patterns of protection have a distinct bias, with higher rates of protection in New World realms than Old World realms. Of the world's terrestrial ecoregions, half do not meet the 2010 Target and 76\% have less than 10\% of their area strictly protected. Approximately 13\% of ecoregions have no strict protected areas. Recent years have seen an expansion of the protected area network, with an average of 0.13\% of the global land area added per year. Most of the expansion since 2003 though has been in Brazil, particularly the Amazon. Without major investments in conservation, spread across the world's ecosystems, the world will likely miss the 2010 target. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

To counter these pressures, patrolling and active wildlife enforcement are widely accepted as fundamental conservation strategies. Using the case example of Khao Yai National Park (KYNP) and data from a camera trap survey, we modeled and evaluated the effectiveness of ranger stations in reducing human access and illegal activities, and in increasing prey and predator presence. This type of data and analysis is needed to monitor and evaluate enforcement effectiveness and develop adaptive management strategies. At KYNP, we used camera-trapping data as a proxy to evaluate whether or not a positive impact of ranger stations on wildlife distribution could outweigh edge effects from human disturbance. We assessed factors affecting the distribution of poachers and wildlife using Maxent. Our analysis was based on 217 camera trap locations (6260 trap nights) and suggests that ungulates and poachers persist nearby ranger stations. Rangers should increase patrolling efforts of border areas; however, increasing wildlife patrolling in inaccessible areas with mobile range units may be more effective than establishing more ranger stations along park boundaries.},

From October 2003 through October 2007, the managers of KYNP conducted a Carnivore Conservation Project to develop and implement long-term monitoring of their large mammal populations. We present these data as an example to demonstrate the usefulness of long-term camera-trapping despite data that cannot be fitted to mark/recapture or occupancy statistical frameworks. Overall, a relatively high number of camera trap photographs was obtained for viverrids (four species; 44 photos) and ursids (two species; 39 photos). However, a relatively low number (range, one to eight) of camera trap photographs was obtained for each of the four felid species and two canid species detected by cameras. Of a total survey effort of 6,260 trap nights, no tigers (Panthera tigris) were detected by camera traps, suggestive of at best a small, non-viable tiger population. Compared to previous camera-trapping efforts at KYNP, we expanded intensive sampling beyond the core area to include all zones and edges of the park. We found significantly lower relative abundance indices (RAIs) for certain mammal species, and collectively for all mammals compared to data obtained in 1999–2000 from 34 similar survey locations, suggesting population declines linked to increased human activity. Information from long-term camera-trapping can provide critical information on the occurrence of elusive species, hotspots, the role of invasive or domestic species, and an indication of the effectiveness of patrolling and other management and conservation interventions.},

  abstract = {In many cases, the first step in large-carnivore management is to obtain objective, reliable, and cost-effective estimates of population parameters through procedures that are reproducible over time. However, monitoring predators over large areas is difficult, and the data have a high level of uncertainty. We devised a practical multimethod and multistate modeling approach based on Bayesian hierarchical-site-occupancy models that combined multiple survey methods to estimate different population states for use in monitoring large predators at a regional scale. We used wolves (Canis lupus) as our model species and generated reliable estimates of the number of sites with wolf reproduction (presence of pups). We used 2 wolf data sets from Spain (Western Galicia in 2013 and Asturias in 2004) to test the approach. Based on howling surveys, the naive estimation (i.e., estimate based only on observations) of the number of sites with reproduction was 9 and 25 sites in Western Galicia and Asturias, respectively. Our model showed 33.4 (SD 9.6) and 34.4 (3.9) sites with wolf reproduction, respectively. The number of occupied sites with wolf reproduction was 0.67 (SD 0.19) and 0.76 (0.11), respectively. This approach can be used to design more cost-effective monitoring programs (i.e., to define the sampling effort needed per site). Our approach should inspire well-coordinated surveys across multiple administrative borders and populations and lead to improved decision making for management of large carnivores on a landscape level. The use of this Bayesian framework provides a simple way to visualize the degree of uncertainty around population-parameter estimates and thus provides managers and stakeholders an intuitive approach to interpreting monitoring results. Our approach can be widely applied to large spatial scales in wildlife monitoring where detection probabilities differ between population states and where several methods are being used to estimate different population parameters. Resumen En muchos casos, el primer paso en el manejo de carnivoros grandes es la obtencion de parametros objetivos, confiables y rentables de estimaciones poblacionales por medio de procedimientos que sean reproducibles en el tiempo. Sin embargo, el monitoreo de depredadores en areas extensas es complicado y los datos tienen un nivel alto de incertidumbre. Disenamos una estrategia multimetodo y multiestado basada en modelos bayesianos jerarquicos de ocupacion de sitio que combinan multiples metodos de seguimiento de censo para estimar los estados de diferentes poblaciones para su uso en el monitoreo de grandes depredadores a una escala regional. Usamos a los lobos (Canis lupus) como especie objetivo y generamos estimaciones confiables del numero de sitios con reproduccion de lobos (presencia de cachorros). Utilizamos dos conjuntos de datos sobre lobos de Espana (Galicia Occidental en 2013 y Asturias en 2014) para probar el modelo. Con base a los muestreos de aullidos, la estimacion ingenua (es decir, la estimacion basada solo en las observaciones) del numero de sitios con reproduccion fue de 9 y 25 sitios en Galicia Occidental y Asturias, respectivamente. Nuestro modelo mostro 33.4 (DS 9.6) y 34.4 (3.9) sitios con reproduccion de lobos, respectivamente. El numero de sitios ocupados con reproduccion de lobos fue de 0.67 (DS 0.19) y 0.76 (0.11), respectivamente. Este modelo puede usarse para disenar programas de monitoreo mas rentables (es decir, para definir el esfuerzo de muestreo necesario por sitio). Nuestro enfoque podria ser utilizado para seguimientos bien coordinados a traves de multiples fronteras administrativas y poblaciones, y apoyaria una mejor toma de decisiones para el manejo de grandes carnivoros a escala de paisaje. El uso de este marco de trabajo bayesiano proporciona una manera simple de visualizar el grado de incertidumbre alrededor de los parametros de estimaciones de poblacion, y asi proporciona a los administradores y a los sectores implicados una estrategia intuitiva para interpretar los resultados de los monitoreos. Nuestra estrategia puede aplicarse extensamente a escalas espaciales grandes en el monitoreo de vida silvestre en los casos en que las probabilidades de deteccion difieren entre los estados poblacionales cuando se estan utilizando varios metodos para estimar diferentes parametros poblacionales.},

Although law enforcement is frequently used to protect tigers and their prey, the conditions under which enforcement is likely to be effective in recovering small populations of wild tigers are not well understood. We evaluated the effectiveness of a law enforcement strategy to recover tigers and their prey in Lao PDR where extensive habitat provided favorable conditions for large increases in tiger numbers if protected from poaching. Over a seven-year period, we monitored along a theory of change to evaluate assumptions about the causal linkages between intermediate results and biological outcomes. Although we found a strong positive correlation between funding for enforcement and days patrolled (rs = 0.786, n = 7, p = 0.05) and a significant negative correlation between days patrolled and overall hunting catch per unit effort (rs = -0.893,n = 7, p {$<$} 0.05), ultimately a proliferation in snaring was associated with decline in several indices of tiger abundance. We conclude that actions were sufficient to reduce poaching and increase prey populations, but insufficient to curtail extirpation of tigers. Recovering small populations of high-value wildlife such as tigers in promising source sites is dependent on establishing a complete enforcement regime, complimentary strategies that build support for the enforcement regime, and a nimble monitoring and evaluation system for agile adaptive management.

We considered why global biodiversity indicators are needed, what characteristics successful global indicators have, and how existing indicators perform. Because monitoring could absorb a large proportion of funds available for conservation, we believe indicators should be linked explicitly to monitoring objectives and decisions about which monitoring schemes deserve funding should be informed by predictions of the value of such schemes to decision making. We suggest that raising awareness among the public and policy makers, auditing management actions, and informing policy choices are the most important global monitoring objectives. Using four well-developed indicators of biological diversity (extent of forests, coverage of protected areas, Living Planet Index, Red List Index) as examples, we analyzed the characteristics needed for indicators to meet these objectives. We recommend that conservation professionals improve on existing indicators by eliminating spatial biases in data availability, fill gaps in information about ecosystems other than forests, and improve understanding of the way indicators respond to policy changes. Monitoring is not an end in itself, and we believe it is vital that the ultimate objectives of global monitoring of biological diversity inform development of new indicators.},

  abstract = {Tropical moist forests contain the majority of terrestrial species. Human actions destroy between 1 and 2 million km(2) of such forests per decade, with concomitant carbon release into the atmosphere. Within these forests, protected areas are the principle defense against forest loss and species extinctions. Four regions-the Amazon, Congo, South American Atlantic Coast, and West Africa-once constituted about half the world's tropical moist forest. We measure forest cover at progressively larger distances inside and outside of protected areas within these four regions, using data-sets on protected areas and land-cover. We find important geographical differences. In the Amazon and Congo, protected areas are generally large and retain high levels of forest cover, as do their surroundings. These areas are protected de facto by being inaccessible and will likely remain protected if they continue to be so. Deciding whether they are also protected de jure - that is, whether effective laws also protect them-is statistically difficult, for there are few controls. In contrast, protected areas in the Atlantic Coast forest and West Africa show sharp boundaries in forest cover at their edges. This effective protection of forest cover is partially offset by their very small size: little area is deep inside protected area boundaries. Lands outside protected areas in the Atlantic Coast forest are unusually fragmented. Finally, we ask whether global databases on protected areas are biased toward highly protected areas and ignore “paper parks.” Analysis of a Brazilian database does not support this presumption.},

  abstract = {Abstract: Conservation funds are grossly inadequate to address the plight of threatened species. Government and conservation organizations faced with the task of conserving threatened species desperately need simple strategies for allocating limited resources. The academic literature dedicated to systematic priority setting usually recommends ranking species on several criteria, including level of endangerment and metrics of species value such as evolutionary distinctiveness, ecological importance, and social significance. These approaches ignore 2 crucial factors: the cost of management and the likelihood that the management will succeed. These oversights will result in misallocation of scarce conservation resources and possibly unnecessary losses. We devised a project prioritization protocol (PPP) to optimize resource allocation among New Zealand's threatened-species projects, where costs, benefits (including species values), and the likelihood of management success were considered simultaneously. We compared the number of species managed and the expected benefits gained with 5 prioritization criteria: PPP with weightings based on species value; PPP with species weighted equally; management costs; species value; and threat status. We found that the rational use of cost and success information substantially increased the number of species managed, and prioritizing management projects according to species value or threat status in isolation was inefficient and resulted in fewer species managed. In addition, we found a clear trade-off between funding management of a greater number of the most cost-efficient and least risky projects and funding fewer projects to manage the species of higher value. Specifically, 11 of 32 species projects could be funded if projects were weighted by species value compared with 16 projects if projects were not weighted. This highlights the value of a transparent decision-making process, which enables a careful consideration of trade-offs. The use of PPP can substantially improve conservation outcomes for threatened species by increasing efficiency and ensuring transparency of management decisions.},

  abstract = {The objective of the “Tree Extraction” project organized by EuroSDR (European Spatial data Research) and ISPRS (International Society of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing) was to evaluate the quality, accuracy, and feasibility of automatic tree extraction methods, mainly based on laser scanner data. In the final report of the project, Kaartinen and Hyyppä (2008) reported a high variation in the quality of the published methods under boreal forest conditions and with varying laser point densities. This paper summarizes the findings beyond the final report after analyzing the results obtained in different tree height classes. Omission/Commission statistics as well as neighborhood relations are taken into account. Additionally, four automatic tree detection and extraction techniques were added to the test. Several methods in this experiment were superior to manual processing in the dominant, co-dominant and suppressed tree storeys. In general, as expected, the taller the tree, the better the location accuracy. The accuracy of tree height, after removing gross errors, was better than 0.5 m in all tree height classes with the best methods investigated in this experiment. For forest inventory, minimum curvature-based tree detection accompanied by point cloud-based cluster detection for suppressed trees is a solution that deserves attention in the future.},

In the mostly unprotected Laikipia-Samburu MIKE site in northern Kenya, elephant mortality data were collected using both standard law enforcement monitoring procedures, relying on patrolling, and participatory methods involving local communities. Qualitatively, traditional patrolling techniques were more successful in protected areas whereas participatory approaches provided more information outside protected areas, where elephant were most at risk from ivory poachers. A minimum of 35\% of the 389 verified carcasses during 2001-2003 were illegally killed. In this baseline study, land uses ranked from highest to lowest by the proportion of illegally killed elephants (PIKE) were community conservation areas, government trust lands, forest reserves, private ranches, settlement areas and national reserves. PIKE trends derived from traditional and participatory data sources were similar across years and indicate elephants were at greater risk in regions outside government or privately patrolled areas. We suggest that PIKE is a useful index for comparing levels and trends in illegal killing of elephants, and that carcass ratios and presence/absence of tusks are useful proxy indicators of mortality and its causes.Resume Le niveau et les tendances des massacres illegaux d'elephants sont mesures par le programme MIKE (Monitoring the Illegal Killing of Elephants- Suivi a long terme de la chasse illicite a l'elephant) utilise par la CITES (Convention sur le commerce international des especes de faune et de flore menacees d'extinction) dans differents sites d'Afrique et d'Asie.

These estimates are often unreliable due to low and variable efficiency and are inappropriate when dealing with rare or endangered species. In the marine Lake Vouliagmeni, a density surface modelling (DSM) approach using survey data from line transects, integrated with a Geographic Information System (GIS), was used to estimate the population density of the endangered fan mussel Pinna nobilis. This is the first time that such an approach has been applied for a marine benthic species. DSM was beneficial in relation to traditional distance sampling. Apart from providing a more precise total abundance estimate, it related the density of the species to spatial covariates of interest, gave a depiction of the species dispersion in the study area, and provided abundance estimates in any sub-region of the study area. In Lake Vouliagmeni, a marked zonation of P. nobilis distribution was revealed, with the species being restricted in the shallow peripheral zone at depths {$<$} 22 m. Two density peaks were observed, a major peak at depths between 12 and 13 m and a secondary peak at -4 m. A main hotspot of high density was also observed in the northeastern part of the lake. Total abundance of the species was estimated to be 6,770 individuals with a 95\% confidence interval of 5,460-8,393 individuals.},

However, monitoring programs often neglect important sources of error and thus can lead to biased estimates, spurious conclusions and false management actions. One such source of error is ‘imperfect detectability’, i.e. the inability of investigators to detect all individuals or all species in a surveyed area. Although there has been great effort to develop monitoring methods that account for imperfect detectability, the application of such methods in the marine environment is not as apparent as in other systems. Plot sampling is by far the most commonly applied method for biological monitoring in the marine environment, yet it largely ignores detectability issues. However, distance sampling, mark-recapture methods, repeated presence-absence surveys for occupancy estimation, and removal methods do estimate detection probabilities and provide unbiased estimates of state variables. We review these methods and the relevant tools for their application in studies on marine populations and communities, with the aim of assisting marine biologists and managers to understand the limitations and pitfalls associated with some approaches and to select the best available methods for their monitoring needs.},

Simple indices based on the number of encounters with a study object are used throughout ecology, conservation and natural resource management (e.g. indices of abundance used in animal surveys or catch per unit effort (CPUE) data in fisheries management). All forms of encounter data arise through the interaction of two sets of behaviours: those of the data generators and those of the data collectors. Analyses of encounter data are prone to bias when these behaviours do not conform to the assumptions used to model them. 2. We review the use of CPUE indices derived from patrol data, which have been promoted for the study of rule-breaking in conservation, highlighting potential sources of bias and noting how similar problems have been tackled for other forms of encounter data. 3. We identify several issues that must be addressed for analyses of patrol data to provide useful information, including the definition of suitable measures of catch and effort, the choice of appropriate temporal and spatial scales, the provision of suitable incentives for ranger patrols and the recording of sufficient information to describe the spatial pattern of sampling. The same issues are also relevant to encounter data more generally. 4. Synthesis and applications. This review describes a common conceptual framework for understanding encounter data, based on the interactions that produce them. We anticipate that an appreciation of these commonalities will lead to improvements in the analysis of encounter data in several fields, by highlighting the existence of methodological approaches that could be more widely applied, and important characteristics of these data that have so far been neglected.]},

Their success depends on changing the incentives of potential rule-breakers and those who monitor and enforce compliance. Project implementers may use payments to encourage monitoring and sanctions to deter rule breaking but there has been little research to examine the effectiveness of such approaches in promoting compliance with conservation rules. The effects of payments and sanctions on poaching in a hypothetical community-based conservation project were investigated using an individual-based model incorporating individual heterogeneity and a realistic range of behaviours. Individuals could choose to poach, monitor others' behaviour, or 'cheat' (claim a fee without actually monitoring behaviour). They could also invest in avoidance to reduce their probability of being detected breaking rules. Community-level outcomes emerged from individuals' choices and strategic interactions. The model demonstrates that payments and sanctions can interact strongly with one another and that their effects depend on the economic context in which they are applied. Sanctions were more reliable than payments in reducing poaching and, in some circumstances, payments produced perverse effects. It is thus important to consider individual-level heterogeneity and strategic decision-making when designing interventions aimed at changing human behaviour.},

We compared two widely practiced standards for counting animals - aerial strip surveys and ground line transects - with interpreted counts of animal tracks. At equal sampling intensity in semiarid savanna with good visibility all three methods produced similar population estimates and precision for six large herbivores. This comparison adds empirical support for the use of track count data to estimate population density rather than being restricted to ambiguous indices of relative abundance. Although expected to capture more species than aerial surveys, we found line transects limiting because encounter rates by direct sightings were relatively low; a minimum threshold 40 observations was achieved for only 1/3 of antelope species in 648.4 km of transect. By contrast, animal track counts returned exceedingly high encounter rates that allowed estimation of abundance for the entire large predator-prey community and mapping density-distributions more completely. Unlike aerial surveys conducted by Botswana's wildlife authority, the track survey provided opportunity to involve local people in the research process. The track survey cost 40\% less than the aerial survey, and could be reduced a further 3-fold if trackers collected data autonomously without motor vehicles. Counting animals by their tracks is ultimately constrained to regions with appropriate substrates. However, in suitable environments like the Kalahari, we suggest that a citizen science driven by expert local trackers could ultimately replace conventional wildlife counts, generating knock-on benefits to conservation beyond improved data.},

Body mass–day range scaling rules and empirical track counts were applied to an established formula to estimate a wide range of wildlife densities. Using the southern Kalahari ecosystem of Botswana as an example, I provide the first comprehensive density estimates for the mammalian wildlife community ({$>$}0.2 kg), including densities for several species previously unattainable by other methods. Among a subset of species, empirical day ranges from this area were consistently greater than those predicted using scaling rules modeled with species from diverse ecosystems. I applied a correction factor based on this discrepancy, which generated values congruent with independent density estimates from the area. Although accurate measures of day range are a practical constraint to estimating densities from track counts, the results suggest that modest efforts to obtain location-specific day range estimates for a subset of species can improve density estimates for others derived from general allometric relationships. Given the strength of track surveys to accumulate unbiased observations quickly, in environments where animal tracks are readily visible, this approach shows potential for the rapid assessment of wildlife abundance.},

  abstract = {Fire is used as a management tool for biodiversity conservation worldwide. A common objective is to avoid population extinctions due to inappropriate fire regimes. However, in many ecosystems, it is unclear what mix of fire histories will achieve this goal. We determined the optimal fire history of a given area for biological conservation with a method that links tools from 3 fields of research: species distribution modeling, composite indices of biodiversity, and decision science. We based our case study on extensive field surveys of birds, reptiles, and mammals in fire-prone semi-arid Australia. First, we developed statistical models of species’ responses to fire history. Second, we determined the optimal allocation of successional states in a given area, based on the geometric mean of species relative abundance. Finally, we showed how conservation targets based on this index can be incorporated into a decision-making framework for fire management. Pyrodiversity per se did not necessarily promote vertebrate biodiversity. Maximizing pyrodiversity by having an even allocation of successional states did not maximize the geometric mean abundance of bird species. Older vegetation was disproportionately important for the conservation of birds, reptiles, and small mammals. Because our method defines fire management objectives based on the habitat requirements of multiple species in the community, it could be used widely to maximize biodiversity in fire-prone ecosystems.},

  abstract = {A key task in ecology is to understand the drivers of animal distributions. In arid and semi-arid environments, this is challenging because animal populations show considerable spatial and temporal variation. An effective approach in such systems is to examine both broad-scale and long-term data. We used this approach to investigate the distribution of small mammal species in semi-arid ‘mallee’ vegetation in south-eastern Australia. First, we examined broad-scale data collected at 280 sites across the Murray Mallee region. We used generalized additive mixed models (GAMMs) to examine four hypotheses concerning factors that influence the distribution of individual mammal species at this scale: vegetation structure, floristic diversity, topography and recent rainfall. Second, we used long-term data from a single conservation reserve (surveyed from 1997 to 2012) to examine small mammal responses to rainfall over a period spanning a broad range of climatic conditions, including record high rainfall in 2011. Small mammal distributions were strongly associated with vegetation structure and rainfall patterns, but the relative importance of these drivers was species-specific. The distribution of the mallee ningaui Ningaui yvonneae, for example, was largely determined by the cover of hummock grass; whereas the occurrence of the western pygmy possum Cercartetus concinnus was most strongly associated with above-average rainfall. Further, the combination of both broad-scale and long-term data provided valuable insights. Bolam’s mouse Pseudomys bolami was uncommon during the broad-scale survey, but long-term surveys showed that it responds positively to above-average rainfall. Conceptual models developed for small mammals in temperate and central arid Australia, respectively, were not, on their own, adequate to account for the distributional patterns of species in this semi-arid ecosystem. Species-specific variation in the relative importance of different drivers was more effectively explained by qualitative differences in life-history attributes among species.},

We conducted 620 1-h lookout watches over the forest canopy from 14 elevated locations along 13.1 km of paved road through Bala, during which we recorded all detections and movements of target species. For a further 619 h, we also recorded all in-forest detections of target species during excursions along and adjacent to the road. Our records covered all months of the year and hours of the day, enabling us to estimate seasonal and diurnal patterns of detection for each target species. We found significant seasonal and diurnal variation for all commoner species in rates of overall detection, visual versus aural detection, and vociferousness. We related most monthly variation to the timing of nesting and most hourly variation to aspects of the behavioural ecology of each species. We used three techniques to estimate dispersion and density for each species, two from lookouts based on our counts of individuals or breeding units per unit area observed, and one from spot maps of core breeding units within 500 m of the road. Differences in our estimates of density varied within and between species, but were mostly lowest for the mean number of individuals detected from lookouts and highest for the maximum of breeding units, whether from lookout detections or core area counts from spot maps. These ranges of densities and their variance indicate upper and lower estimates for each species, and the differences between them and other survey techniques were explicable partly by the behavioural ecology of each species or apparent changes in density. Our density estimates never exceeded the highest comparative estimates for target species or near relatives in other forest habitats, although few were available for diurnal raptors. We suggest that 1-h lookout watches over forest, where feasible, offer alternative and efficient estimates of detection, dispersion and density to conventional distance-sampling techniques conducted from within forest. They will achieve optimum accuracy when conducted during the most detectable periods for target species, particularly for obvious and sparsely dispersed bird species.},

  abstract = {Abundance estimation in ecology is usually accomplished by capture–recapture, removal, or distance sampling methods. These may be hard to implement at large spatial scales. In contrast, binomial mixture models enable abundance estimation without individual identification, based simply on temporally and spatially replicated counts. Here, we evaluate mixture models using data from the national breeding bird monitoring program in Switzerland, where some 250 1-km2 quadrats are surveyed using the territory mapping method three times during each breeding season. We chose eight species with contrasting distribution (wide–narrow), abundance (high–low), and detectability (easy–difficult). Abundance was modeled as a random effect with a Poisson or negative binomial distribution, with mean affected by forest cover, elevation, and route length. Detectability was a logit-linear function of survey date, survey date-by-elevation, and sampling effort (time per transect unit). Resulting covariate effects and parameter estimates were consistent with expectations. Detectability per territory (for three surveys) ranged from 0.66 to 0.94 (mean 0.84) for easy species, and from 0.16 to 0.83 (mean 0.53) for difficult species, depended on survey effort for two easy and all four difficult species, and changed seasonally for three easy and three difficult species. Abundance was positively related to route length in three high-abundance and one low-abundance (one easy and three difficult) species, and increased with forest cover in five forest species, decreased for two nonforest species, and was unaffected for a generalist species. Abundance estimates under the most parsimonious mixture models were between 1.1 and 8.9 (median 1.8) times greater than estimates based on territory mapping; hence, three surveys were insufficient to detect all territories for each species. We conclude that binomial mixture models are an important new approach for estimating abundance corrected for detectability when only repeated-count data are available. Future developments envisioned include estimation of trend, occupancy, and total regional abundance.},

Mathematical and statistical models play a critical role in this process by integrating data from multiple sources in a way that is honest about uncertainty. We show the utility of Bayesian hierarchical models for supporting decisions on managing natural resources of national parks. These models can assimilate monitoring data to provide true forecasts, resulting in probabilistic predictions of future states of park ecosystems accompanied by rigorous estimates of uncertainty. We discuss a novel approach for communicating these forecasts to decision makers who need to evaluate the probability that NPS goals will be met given different management actions, including the null model of no action. We illustrate how this approach has been used successfully to inform decisions on the elk (Cervus elaphus nelsoni) population management in Rocky Mountain National Park based on 47 yr of monitoring data. Forecasts from a discrete time, stage-structured population model assimilated with annual census and sex and age classifications are being used annually to help park managers decide on actions needed to meet goals for elk and vegetation. In particular, park managers were able to determine the probability that the elk population would fall within a desired population range, which led to both population reduction actions and no action depending on the year of interest. Moreover, this approach allowed multiple survey methodologies from the last 47 years to be incorporated into a single model with associated estimates of uncertainty. Models like this one are especially useful for adaptive management where continuous improvement in models and data results in long-term improvement in the wisdom of policy and management.},

Crown diameters and spatial situation of all trees were recorded using distance and azimuth. Data were transferred to computer and stem map was generated with ArcGIS Software. Distance sampling methods include point-centred quarter method (PCQ), joint-point method (JP), Random pairs method (RP), T-Square method (T-Sq) and Quartered neighbour methods beside fixed area plot (FAP), n-tree and variable area transect (VAT) methods were conducted on generated stem maps. A time study was done aiding indices determined in field works. In site I, point centred quarter estimator with measurements to the second closest individual in each quadrant had the lowest relative bias (RBIAS) in estimating density followed by 3-tree and closest individual methods. In clumped pattern (site II), variable area transect method with measurements to the 4th and 5th closest individuals in each transect brought the best results. The most time consuming methods after fixed area plot, were point centred quarter estimators while methods considering measurement to the closest individual were rapid. Considering RBIAS and Time together, VAT method was the best sampling method in clumped pattern followed by point centred quarter estimator with measurements to the second closest individual in each quadrant and closest individual estimators. In random pattern, point centred quarter estimator with measurements to the second closest individual in each quadrant was the best method followed by 3-tree and closest individual estimators. But for estimating cover per unit area N-tree methods performed well. As in this site, VAT method located in 4th grade, and due to simplicity of field works related to this method, in the case that the investigator would not be able to clearly define spatial pattern of the population, this method can be recommended as well.},

Three transect widths were chosen, 10-m, 15-m and 20-m and distances to the 3(rd), 4(th) and 5(th) individual. Transect width affected the estimation, a 20-m width transect had the least relative bias (-0.5\%), and a 10-m width sampling had the greatest bias (-20\%). However, all methods underestimated the plant density. The most accurate estimation was with the 3(rd) plant distance and 20-m transect. As the VAT method is more efficient per unit effort in the field than the quadrate methods, it can be recommended for rapid assessment of desert communities density (like saxaul) especially when plants are dispersed at random.},

Both methods detected presence of New England cottontail at 4 of 5 sites. Overall proportion of DNA samples consisted of New England cottontail was similar between sampling methods (x(2) = 0.189, P = 0.664). However, species composition on individual sites was inconsistent between methods and no clear pattern of bias was discernible. Mean cost per DNA sample to collect and analyze was US\$433 for tissue samples and US\$33 for fecal pellets. Samples collected per person-day of effort were 40 for fecal samples and 0.7 for tissue samples. Genetic monitoring via noninvasive fecal sampling was a low-cost, time-efficient method for assessing species occupancy, but development of an optimal sampling strategy is needed to evaluate composition and distributions of species on sympatrically occupied sites.

We present SIAFOR, a computer programme for the calculation of four nearest-neighbour indices, which describe the spatial arrangement of tree positions, the distribution pattern of species, and the size differentiation between trees. The study uses SIAFOR as a sampling simulator in eight completely stem-mapped forest stands of varying area and structural complexity. We statistically evaluate two sample types (distance and plot sampling), comparing sampling error, bias and minimum sample size for index estimation. We introduce the concepts of measurement expansion factor (MEF) and design expansion factor (DEF) for the technical evaluation of sample type efficiency (optimal sample type). Results indicate that sampling error can reach high levels and that minimum sample sizes for index estimation often amply exceed the limit of 20\% of tree density or 20 trees per species per hectare, that we set as the highest feasible sample size in normal situations. We found clear feasibility limits (in terms of minimal tree densities and reachable accuracy levels) for the estimation of all investigated indices. Generally, equal or higher sample sizes are needed for plot sampling than for distance sampling to reach equal accuracy levels. Nevertheless, plot sampling resulted more efficient for the estimation of tree size differentiation at low to medium accuracy levels. For all other investigated indices distance sampling resulted more efficient than plot sampling. Minimum sample size increases with accuracy and is negatively correlated with tree density. At a given accuracy level minimum sample size is highest for the estimation of relative mingling and lowest for tree size differentiation; furthermore it is generally lower in large stands than in small ones. Because of the consistency of our conclusions in all of the investigated stands, we think they apply in most stands of similar area (between 1 and 10 ha) and species diversity (not more than four species).

  abstract = {Good density estimates for low abundance tree species are costly to achieve especially in rugged or disturbed forest landscapes. More efficient methods would be of considerable value to managers and conservationists. Here we assess a method that has been neglected in this context. We examine and compare distance-based visual detection line-transects and conventional fixed-width transects for assessing a distinctive low abundance species of conservation significance, Myrianthus holstii Engl., in three separate areas, within a steep, disturbed mountain rain forest. Precision and implied accuracy appeared substantially better with the visual detection line-transect than with the fixed-width transect for equivalent costs and effort at all three landscapes but as the two methods provide different estimates there are questions of possible bias in both approaches. We discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the distance approach and suggest some recommendations concerning its application. We conclude that the distance method is suited to low density species that are easily identified, even when understorey vegetation and terrain severely impair visibility. However, due to the differences in detection probabilities, populations need to be stratified both by tree size and context. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

The subject of interest is focused on matrix algebraic properties of the Fisher information matrix (FIM) of stationary processes. The FIM is an ingredient of the Crame´r-Rao inequality, and belongs to the basics of asymptotic estimation theory in mathematical statistics. The FIM is interconnected with the Sylvester, Bezout and tensor Sylvester matrices. Through these interconnections it is shown that the FIM of scalar and multiple stationary processes fulfill the resultant matrix property. A statistical distance measure involving entries of the FIM is presented. In quantum information, a different statistical distance measure is set forth. It is related to the Fisher information but where the information about one parameter in a particular measurement procedure is considered. The FIM of scalar stationary processes is also interconnected to the solutions of appropriate Stein equations, conditions for the FIM to verify certain Stein equations are formulated. The presence of Vandermonde matrices is also emphasized.},

  abstract = {Line-transect distance sampling is widely used to estimate population densities using distances of observed targets from transect lines to model detectability. When the target taxa are high density, the frequent measuring of distances may make the method seem impractical. We present a method that improves the efficiency of distance sampling when the target species occurs at high density. Only a proportion of targets are measured to model the detection function, and the time saved on the survey is then used to cover a longer total length of transect and accrue a larger ‘count only’ sample. This approach can improve the precision of the population density estimate when the cost of measuring the distance to a detected target is more than half the cost of walking to the next target. We find the optimal proportion of distances to measure that minimises the variance of the density estimate for a fixed survey budget. We quantify how much this optimised strategy increases the precision of the density estimate compared with conventional line-transect distance sampling. We then use simulated distance sampling data to test our expressions, and illustrate circumstances under which the optimised approach would be beneficial using distance sampling data on high-density plants. The simulations indicate that the optimised method delivers benefits in precision, but the magnitude of the benefit is lower than predicted from our expressions, which are based on an asymptotic approximation of the variance. We apply an adjustment to the predicted benefit equation to account for this difference, and show that, in all three plant case studies, the optimised approach could improve the precision gained from a distance sampling survey between 20\% and 50\%. This new approach could broaden the ecological contexts in which distance sampling is applied, to include estimation of densities of abundant taxa where plots are conventionally used. The method may have interesting applications for other survey types, including multispecies surveys or those using cues or signs that occur at high density.},

However, how much sampling area is enough for biodiversity monitoring in riparian area, the ecotone among freshwater and terrestrial system? Whether the optimal sampling areas are different among ecoregions? To explore these scientific questions, the minimum sampling area of riparian herbs was studied in Taizi river, Liaoning province, China. The species-area relationship was modeled using average species richness in the same area (2.25, 4.5, 6.75 and 9 m(2)) of 55 sites distributed along riparian zone of Taizi river water course. The power model S = aA (b) modeled best, and was selected to fit species-area curves. The minimum sampling areas for total species and dominant families were calculated via the selected model and corresponding estimated species richness. Results showed that the minimum sampling areas (MSAs) for herbs diversity monitoring in whole basin, highland ecoregion, midland ecoregion and lowland ecoregion of Taizi river were 12.82, 12.06, 13.46 and 13.08 m(2),respectively. The MSAs of dominant families Compositae species and Graminale species were similar to that of total species. The minimum sampling area of Taizi river riparian zone was similar to other temperate riparian grassland and wet grassland, larger than dry grassland and salt meadow. So we did not need consider ecoregion difference for temperate riparian herbs diversity monitoring in watershed scale.},

To quantify avian response patterns along a burn severity gradient, we sampled 49 random plots ( 2001 - 2002) at the 17351- ha Cerro Grande Fire ( 2000) in New Mexico, USA. Additionally, pre-. re avian surveys ( 1986 1988, 1990) created a unique opportunity to quantify avifaunal changes in 13 pre-. re transects ( resampled in 2002) and to compare two designs for analyzing the effects of unplanned disturbances: after- only analysis and before - after comparisons.

We analyzed after- only densities for 21 species using gradient analysis, which detected a broad range of responses to increasing burn severity: (I) large significant declines, (II) weak, but signi. cant declines, (III) no signi. cant density changes, (IV) peak densities in low- or moderate- severity patches, (V) weak, but signi. cant increases, and (VI) large signi. cant increases. Overall, 71\% of the species included in the after- only gradient analysis exhibited either positive or neutral density responses to. re effects across all or portions of the severity gradient ( responses III - VI). We used pre/ post pairs analysis to quantify density changes for 15 species using before - after comparisons; spatiotemporal variation in densities was large and confounded. re effects for most species. Only four species demonstrated signi. cant effects of burn severity, and their densities were all higher in burned compared to unburned forests. Pre- and post-. re community similarity was high except in high- severity areas. Species richness was similar pre- and post-. re across all burn severities. Thus, ecosystem restoration programs based on the assumption that recent severe. res in Southwestern ponderosa pine forests have overriding negative ecological effects are not supported by our study of post-. re avian communities. This study illustrates the importance of quantifying burn severity and controlling confounding sources of spatiotemporal variation in studies of. re effects.

Observers are typically limited to search within 5 or 10 m from the line, while observers are unrestricted in larger specified search regions in area surveys. Although methods differ slightly, the selection is often based on producing defendable data for conservation, maximizing data quality, and minimizing effort. To guide method selection, we compared butterfly surveys using 1) line versus area methods and 2) varying width transects (5 m, 10 m, or unrestricted) using count data from surveys in North Dakota from 2015 to 2018. Between line and area surveys, we detected more individuals with area surveys, even when accounting for effort. However, both methods accumulated new species at similar rates. When comparing transect methodology, we detected nearly 60\% more individuals and nine more species when transect width increased from 5 m to unrestricted, despite similar effort across methodology. Overall, we found line surveys slightly less efficient at detecting individuals, but they collected similar species richness to area surveys when accounting for effort. Additionally, line surveys allow the use of unrestricted-width transects with distance sampling procedures, which were more effective at detecting species and individuals while providing a means to correct count data over the same transect length. Methods that reduce effort and accurately depict communities are especially important for conservation when long-term datasets are unavailable.},

  abstract = {Butterflies are consistently the focus of conservation research because they contribute to ecosystem services, act as biological indicators, and are in decline worldwide. Land managers and researchers use many methods to measure butterfly populations, but this creates issues for standardization and production of comparative, rigorous data. To promote methods more appropriate for research-based conservation, we conducted a literature review focusing on the implementation and advancement of butterfly monitoring methods over time. We identified four main methods that are most frequently used in butterfly research and monitoring: (1) trapping and netting, (2) mark-recapture, (3) transects (Pollard walks), and (4) distance sampling. Although a progression of method development has occurred over time, all methods are still currently used in butterfly research, with trapping, netting, and mark-recapture used in 85\% of studies. Over the last century, the amount of butterfly research has steadily increased, so it is vital to select methods that produce accurate, and comparable data. However, we found that method selection was not solely based on the type of data needed for accurate interpretation and extrapolation of results. Instead, land context, species abundance, and historically-used methods are driving method selection. As butterflies remain a high conservation priority, researchers must provide rigorous data that are necessary for creating effective conservation plans and policies by using a framework for method selection.},

  abstract = {Large-mammal surveys often rely on indirect signs such as dung or nests. Sign density is usually translated into animal density using sign production and decay rates. In principle, such auxiliary variable estimates should be made in a spatially unbiased manner. However, traditional decay rate estimation methods entail following many signs from production to disappearance, which, in large study areas, requires extensive travel effort. Consequently, decay rate estimates have tended to be made instead at some convenient but unrepresentative location. In this study we evaluated how much bias might be induced by extrapolating decay rates from unrepresentative locations, how much effort would be required to implement current methods in a spatially unbiased manner, and what alternate approaches might be used to improve precision. To evaluate the extent of bias induced by unrepresentative sampling, we collected data on gorilla dung at several central African sites. Variation in gorilla dung decay rate was enormous, varying by up to an order of magnitude within and between survey zones. We then estimated what the effort-precision relationship would be for a previously suggested "retrospective'' decay rate (RDR) method, if it were implemented in a spatially unbiased manner. We also evaluated precision for a marked sign count (MSC) approach that does not use a decay rate. Because they require repeat visits to remote locations, both RDR and MSC require enormous effort levels in order to gain precise density estimates. Finally, we examined an objective criterion for decay (i.e.,dung height). This showed great potential for improving RDR efficiency because choosing a high threshold height for decay reduces decay time and, consequently, the number of visits that need to be made to remote areas. The ability to adjust decay time using an objective decay criterion also opens up the potential for a "prospective'' decay rate (PDR) approach. Further research is necessary to evaluate whether the temporal bias inherent in such an approach is small enough to ignore, given the 10 -20-fold increases in precision promised by a PDR approach.},

  abstract = {Numerous species of Unionidae are presently threatened by anthropogenic impacts on freshwater ecosystems. Field inventories, based on reliable presence/absence observations, are urgently needed to improve their protection. Such observations should be comparable between sites and collected with minimal surveying effort. Here, we demonstrate a strategy that minimises sampling effort while maximising inventory efficiency, formulated using hydromorphological data from 26 river sites sampled in north-eastern France between 2009 and 2010. Our findings indicate that a comprehensive visual survey of seven x river width with a bathyscope confirmed unionid presence in 96 \% of cases, and presence of all unionid species in 88 \% of cases. A further seven x width search increased this latter figure to 96 \%, while a third (=21 x width) ensured that all species were registered in all rivers surveyed. Based on these results, we recommend that surveyors first undertake an initial seven x river width visual survey to confirm unionid presence. If no Unionidae are observed over this distance, sampling ceases and the site is marked negative. If at least one Unionidae is observed over this distance, an additional upstream stretch of the same length is surveyed with identical sampling effort. If at least one new species is observed within this second stretch, then a third and final stretch can be surveyed. This method is discussed in the light of representativeness of hydromorphological habitats (e.g. pool spacing and meander wavelength).},

For arbitrary-distributed populations, we compared the following: (i) systematic random transect allocation, (ii) random selection of footpaths, and (iii) two-stage sampling selection of footpaths (2, 5, 10 blocks). The performance of two-stage sampling and random footpath selection estimators was similar. Then, we applied previous results to estimate the size of a red deer (Cervus elaphus) population in the Italian Apennines. Using data from a pilot survey, we estimated density via CDS and density surface modeling (DSM), and we quantified survey costs per unit effort. Considering our deer distribution, we finally simulated and evaluated the cost-effectiveness of the abovementioned designs for a range of realistic efforts (25-65 transects). CDS produced a negatively biased and less precise estimate than the corresponding DSM. For an effort of 65 transects, design (ii) estimates were unbiased (coefficient of variation= 0.31), while design (iii) provided negatively biased estimates (coefficient of variation= 0.27). Two-stage sampling designs with few blocks were less expensive than other designs in attaining the same level of precision, and they emerged as a cost-effective survey design. Our simulation approach thus provided managers a readily available tool to improve the estimate of ungulate abundances at a landscape scale.},

Thus, there is a need to accurately and efficiently identify hotspots of road-mortality for hazard assessment and mitigation. In 2002, we conducted walking and driving surveys throughout an extensive rural highway network in northern New York, USA, to evaluate survey methods and to quantify spatial and temporal patterns of herpetofauna road-mortality. In 2004, we repeated the surveys at a subset of locations to quantify interannual repeatability. Reptile and amphibian species had different peak periods of road-mortality because they differed in the causes of movements that resulted in crossings. Spatial locations of herpetofauna road-mortality were concentrated at a limited number of hotspots. Hotspots overlapped across species and were located at consistent locations across years. Results of walking and driving surveys were highly repeatable among survey teams, but driving surveys underestimated the density of road-mortality because many animals were missed. Detection failure was higher in some taxa (e.g., frogs) than others (e.g., turtles). Our results indicate that it is possible to design a valid, efficient methodology for locating hotspots of reptile and amphibian road-mortality along a road network and, thus, pinpoint priority sites for mitigation.},

It has been suggested that estimates can be improved by building species- or strata-specific biomass models. However, few studies have attempted a systematic analysis of the benefits of such stratification, especially in combination with other factors such as sensor type, statistical prediction method and sampling design of the reference inventory data. We addressed this topic by analyzing the impact of stratifying forest data into three classes (broadleaved, coniferous and mixed forest). We compare predictive accuracy (a) between the strata (b) to a case without stratification for a set of preselected predictors from airborne LiDAR and hyperspectral data obtained in a managed mixed forest site in southwestern Germany. We used 5 commonly applied algorithms for biomass predictions on bootstrapped subsamples of the data to obtain cross validated RMSE and r2 diagnostics. Those values were analyzed in a factorial design by an analysis of variance (ANOVA) to rank the relative importance of each factor. Selected models were used for wall-to-wall mapping of biomass estimates and their associated uncertainty. The results revealed marginal advantages for the strata-specific prediction models over the unstratified ones, which were more obvious on the wall-to-wall mapped area-based predictions. Yet further tests are necessary to establish the generality of these results. Input data type and statistical prediction method are concluded to remain the two most crucial factors for the quality of remote sensingassisted biomass models.},

  abstract = {Ecological and economic evaluation should be a key component of biodiversity conservation programmes since it underpins the efficient allocation of resources. However, most such programmes are not currently assessed in terms of the rate of return on investment that they provide. The UK Government launched the UK Biodiversity Action Plan in 1994. We collected data from those responsible for monitoring this programme, then used a form of cost-effectiveness analysis to evaluate its effectiveness and efficiency at meeting the targets of individual Species Action Plans. In this context, effectiveness refers to the goal of maximising total conservation gains, whereas efficiency refers to maximising conservation gain per unit cost. We define the latter as a basic economic objective for conservation resource allocation. We find that the distribution of spending across plans was highly biased towards vertebrates and there was no correlation between cost and effectiveness. Non-vertebrate plans tended to be more efficient than vertebrate plans. However, following a species utility-based weighting, this tendency was less pronounced and a significant positive correlation between cost and effectiveness emerged. Nevertheless, this evidence suggests that the efficiency of the UK Biodiversity Action Plan could be improved by correcting the imbalance in spending between vertebrate and non-vertebrate plans. This study highlights the importance of effective monitoring and reporting in determining the utility of biodiversity conservation programmes. It demonstrates how explicit cost-effectiveness analysis can be used to evaluate such programmes, and shows that it could also be adapted to accommodate other forms of ecological and social value.

We developed multi-scale, seasonal models to explore how local resource selection by the threatened forest-dwelling woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) was influenced by both broad-scale landscape context and local resource heterogeneity in the intensively managed region of Charlevoix, Qu,bec, Canada, located on the southern border of the North American caribou range. We estimated resource selection functions using 23 GPS-collared caribou monitored from 2004 to 2006 and landscape data on vegetation classes, terrain conditions, and roads. We found evidence of thresholds in road “proximity” effects (up to 1.25 km), which underscores the importance of including landscape context variables in addition to locally measured variables, and of fitting seasonal-specific models given temporal variation in the magnitude of selection and optimal scale of measurement. Open lichen woodlands were an important cover type for caribou during winter and spring, whereas deciduous forests, wetlands, and even young disturbed stands became important during calving and summer. Caribou consistently avoided roads and rugged terrain conditions at both local and landscape levels. Landscape context fundamentally constrains the choices available to animals, and we showed that failing to consider landscape context, or arbitrarily choosing an inappropriate scale for measuring covariates, may provide biased inferences with respect to habitat selection patterns. Effective habitat management for rare or declining species should carefully consider the hierarchical nature of habitat selection.},

These require a constant supply of resources, the level of which is determined by the concern of the society about biodiversity conservation. In this paper, we study the optimal fraction of the resources to invest in activities for enhancing the social concern y (t) by environmental education, museum displays, publications, and media exposure. We search for the strategy that maximizes the time-integral of the quality of the conservation area x (t) with temporal discounting. Analyses based on dynamic programming and Pontryagin's maximum principle show that the optimal control consists of two phases: (1) in the first phase, the social concern level approaches to the final optimal value y*, (2) in the second phase, resources are allocated to both activities, and the social concern level is kept constant y (t) = y*. If the social concern starts from a low initial level, the optimal path includes a period in which the quality of the conservation area declines temporarily, because all the resources are invested to enhance the social concern. When the support rate increases with the quality of the conservation area itself x (t) as well as with the level of social concern y (t), both variables may increase simultaneously in the second phase. We discuss the implication of the results to good management of biodiversity conservation areas. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

With the aim of developing a standardised method of surveying parrots in the rainforests of New Caledonia, we used distance sampling to estimate densities of New Caledonian Parakeets (Cyanoramphus saisseti), Horned Parakeets (Eunymphicus cornutus), Ouvea Parakeets (E. uvaeensis), and New Caledonian Rainbow Lorikeets (Trichoglossus haematodus deplanchii). We carried out surveys in the early morning and late afternoon, when parrots were easiest to detect. To minimise errors associated with estimating distances and flock sizes by ear, we conducted brief searches to locate parrots, then measured their distance from the transect line. We recorded birds in flight and consider these records to be important when estimating parakeet populations. In agreement with existing knowledge on distance sampling, we found line transects to be more efficient than point transects for estimating the density of parakeets. Our results indicate that parrots located beyond 50-70 m from the transect line have little influence upon density estimates. In addition, surveys on roads are likely to underestimate densities if not corrected for road width. We generated relatively stable and precise density estimates (CV {$<$} 0.25) with approximately 40-50 detections, yet additional effort may be warranted under different study conditions. Although we aimed to improve parrot surveys in New Caledonia, our suggestions may be useful to other researchers studying rainforest birds, and can be adapted to suit different species or environments.},

Distance sampling is currently one of the most widely used monitoring methods. However, it relies on strict sampling designs and modeling assumptions that can be difficult to meet in the field. Here, we use data from two sub-populations of non-migratory wild Svalbard reindeer Rangifer tarandus platyrhynchus inhabiting flat, open and isolated coastal tundra plains, to demonstrate some challenges related to the distance sampling methodology. To achieve this, we compared distance sampling line transect estimates with repeated total population counts and combined available software tools (R packages unmarked, Distance and dsm) to fulfill the analytical requirements of small study sites in which large areas are surveyed relative to the study area size. Based on low variation among repeated total counts (CV. 0.02 - 0.06) and the virtual absence of false negatives and positives of marked animals, the total counts could be used as reference population sizes. Distance sampling estimates were not statistically different from the total count estimates. Our relatively large sample size of 143 observations enabled precise distance sampling abundance estimates (CV. 0.16 - 0.26) compared with other studies in the wild. However, capturing the processes shaping population dynamics would likely require even higher sampling effort or other, more resource demanding monitoring tools, such as total counts or mark-recapture. In this type of ecosystem, distance sampling nevertheless represents a cost-effective tool suitable for 'population state' assessment and studies of large-scale spatial distribution patterns. Our study stresses the importance of choosing the appropriate analytical tools and estimating the accuracy of the monitoring methods that are used to achieve specific scientific, management or conservation goals.},

Assessing the vulnerabilities of seabirds to maritime hazards requires an understanding of their species distribution, and a means for combining this information across groups. Using at-sea survey data gathered as part of a regional monitoring program, an efficient framework for integrating multi-species data was developed. Survey data was incorporated within a distance sampling framework to generate bias-corrected seabird densities for an area of over 730,000 km(2) size, which were used to construct multiple species distribution models (SDMs). The structural difficulties associated with sampling sparsely distributed individuals that also occur in large, localized concentrations led to the use of three modelling techniques potentially well suited for this type of data: negative binomial, ''hurdle'', and random forest methods. Predicted abundances were combined to produce an ensemble forecast, which met or exceeded the accuracy of predictions from the individual models. Multi-species potential sensitivity maps were developed to identify core areas, confirming the general importance of physiographic features such as the shelf break and bathymetry. Distribution was also seasonally influenced, with spring and winter standing out as periods of peak importance. When combined with an oil pollution layer derived from aerial surveillance, vulnerability was highest in the vicinity of major ports (e.g., Halifax and Sydney, Nova Scotia). However, the vulnerability map also indicated lower but widespread levels of oiling risk throughout the shelf, presumably associated with persistently high levels of shipping traffic and ongoing petroleum extraction and exploration. Outside of this region, migratory connectivity is expected to expose seabirds to a wider network of hazards and further underscores the need for the coordinated and routine collection of marine hazard data alongside at-sea distributional data.

However, this approach does not permit to go into details on demographic processes. Therefore, Capture-Recapture (CR) surveys have become popular tools for scientists and practitioners willing to measure survival response to environmental change or conservation actions. However, CR surveys are expensive and their design is often driven by the available resources, without estimation about the level of precision they provide for detecting changes in survival, despite optimising resource allocation in wildlife monitoring is increasingly important. Investigating how CR surveys could be optimised by manipulating resource allocation among different design components is therefore critically needed. We have conducted a simulation experiment exploring the statistical power of a wide range of CR survey designs to detect changes in the survival rate of birds. CR surveys differ in terms of number of breeding pairs monitored, number of offspring and adults marked, resighting effort and survey duration. We compared open-nest (ON) and nest-box (NB) monitoring types, using medium- and long-lived model species. Increasing survey duration and number of pairs monitored increased statistical power. Long survey duration can provide accurate estimations for long-lived birds even for small population size (15 pairs). A cost-benefit analysis revealed that for long-lived ON species, ringing as many chicks as possible appears as the most effective survey component, unless a technique for capturing breeding birds at low cost is available to compensate for reduced local recruitment. For medium-lived NB species, focusing the NB rounds at a period that maximises the chance to capture breeding females inside nest-boxes is more rewarding than ringing all chicks. We show that integrating economic costs is crucial when designing CR surveys and discuss ways to improve efficiency by reducing duration to a time scale compatible with management and conservation issues.},

Furthermore, we included some specimens of uncertain taxonomic identification to test their affinities and the utility of the shape of the molar to identify incomplete specimens. We evaluated the variations in the shape of the first upper molar (M1) among 46 owl pellets specimens of Calomys, including C. expulsus (n = 15), C. tener (n = 15), and unidentified specimens treated as Calomys sp. (n = 16) through GM analysis using 17 landmarks. The data was explored using PCA, PERMANOVA, and Discriminant analyses over the Procrustes residuals matrix were applied to evaluate inter- and intraspecific shape differences. Also, we evaluated whether allometric shape differences could impact the data, but found no evidence of a correlation between size and shape. Our results support that shape differences in the M1 are effective for discriminating between C. tener and C. expulsus. Moreover, the unidentified specimens do not represent a third shape but could be identified with confidence either as C. tener or C. expulsus. Our results show that even with fragmentary materials, GM is a feasible and useful tool for exploring inter-specific shape differences and assisting in taxonomic identification as a complement to traditional qualitative description of diagnostic features in poorly preserved specimens.},

  abstract = {Nest box programs have often been established to conserve hollow-dependent fauna but their effectiveness is unknown in many jurisdictions. We examined nest box effectiveness in a 10-year experimental study in the Mountain Ash (Eucalyptus regnans) forests of Victoria (south-eastern Australia) where the paucity of hollow-bearing trees is a significant conservation issue. We quantified occupancy by arboreal marsupials, infestation by pest invertebrates, and nest box attrition. We found a large proportion of nest boxes (68.8\%) were never used, including by the endangered target species, Leadbeater’s Possum (Gymnobelideus leadbeateri). Nest boxes were more often occupied in younger forests (58.3\% cf 4.1\% for old forest) but these sites were also where infestations by the introduced European Honeybee (Apis mellifera) were greatest and where the probability of nest boxes collapsing was highest. Our data suggest that it is important to carefully target the locations where nest boxes should be established, but these same places are also those where most effort is required to maintain them, either by removing pest invertebrates and/or by re-attaching them to trees after they have fallen down. We recorded reasonable levels of occupancy by arboreal marsupials in young forest ∼2–3 years after box establishment, but then high levels of nest box attrition ({$>$}51\%) occurred after 8–10 years. This suggests an “effective occupancy time” for arboreal marsupials of only ∼5 years. A key consideration must be to weigh the ecological and economic effectiveness of nest boxes against other strategies such as implementing alternative silvicultural systems that result in the creation and retention of more hollow-bearing trees within logged areas.},

We addressed this question using a detailed case study encompassing a rare suite of inter-connected cross-sectional and longitudinal investigations that have spanned the past two decades and included work on: (1) the decay and collapse of large-cavity forest trees (termed "trees with hollows"), (2) populations of a suite of species of arboreal marsupials that are reliant on trees with hollows as nesting and denning sites, and (3) relationships between the abundance, type, and condition of trees with hollows and the presence, abundance, and species richness of these animals. Our case study was from the montane ash eucalypt forests of the Central Highlands of Victoria, southeastern Australia. Our longitudinal studies led to new insights that either would not have been possible from a cross-sectional study, or which were unexpected because they did not conform, or only partially conformed, to postulated responses made at the outset based on the results of earlier research. These new insights included: (1) a substantial slowing in rates of tree fall between 1997 and 2006, which were significantly lower than predicted from earlier data gathered between 1983 and 1993, (2) no evidence for a decline in populations of almost all species of arboreal marsupials between 1997 and 2007, despite the loss of nearly 14\% of the measured population of trees with hollows during that time, (3) changes in nest tree selection by some species of arboreal marsupials in response to these changes in hollow availability, (4) concentration effects, in which populations of animals used the declining tree hollow resource more intensively, and (5) evidence for significant rainfall effects on temporal changes in animal abundance. Our case study underscored the additional ecological insights that can be generated from longitudinal studies, including how relationships between biota and their habitat can change over time. Understanding these temporal changes is essential for informed forest management and biodiversity conservation, and points toward the need for greater use of longitudinal data sets in ecology. © 2011 by the Ecological Society of America.},

  abstract = {This paper reports the outcomes of a novel inter-twining of long-term monitoring data and population modelling to assess the accuracy of predictions of a Population Viability Analysis (PVA) model. In particular, the relative effectiveness of different management options for reserving areas from timber harvesting was assessed for two forest-dependent arboreal marsupials, the greater glider (Petauroides volans) and Leadbeater's Possum (Gymnobelideus leadbeateri). We used data from 7 years of monitoring conducted at 161 sites to assess and modify, where appropriate, previous population models of the two species of arboreal marsupials. The results indicated that the importance of food resources for both had been underestimated in past work. Despite this, the modified models that included increased importance of food availability did not change the predicted risks of decline substantially, particularly for Leadbeater's Possum. Importantly, past conclusions about the optimal sizes of patches to reserve within the forests used wood production were robust to changes in the model. This is a valuable finding because the work we report is one of the first to empirically test the robustness of the relative predictions of a PVA model. Nevertheless, the new insights we derived from this study have implications both for: (1) the implementation of our ongoing long-term monitoring study, in particular the value of what can be termed ȁ8adaptive monitoring', and, (2) the establishment of a new silvicultural experiment designed to better create habitat for arboreal marsupials within logged and regenerated sites.},

  abstract = {Although fire is a major form of natural disturbance worldwide, both fire-derived landscape context effects and the impacts of fire severity are poorly known for many species. To address this knowledge gap, we quantified the response of Australian arboreal marsupials to: (1) the spatial effects of fire, (2) fire severity, and (3) fire impacts on the availability of critical nesting resources – hollow-bearing trees. We identified substantial differences among species in response to fire severity and landscape-scale fire. The Sugar Glider (Petaurus breviceps) and the endangered Leadbeater’s Possum (Gymnobelideus leadbeateri) were extremely rare on burned sites irrespective of fire severity. In addition, these two species declined with the amount of burned forest in the surrounding landscape even when their habitat remained unburnt. The Mountain Brushtail Possum (Trichosurus cunninghami) and the Greater Glider (Petauroides volans) both occurred on burned and unburned sites. The Greater Glider responded negatively to fire severity at the site level and also negatively to the amount of forest burned in the surrounding landscape. The abundance of the Mountain Brushtail Possum was lowest on sites subject to moderate severity fire. On unburned sites, the presence and abundance of virtually all species was characterised by a common positive response to the availability of nesting resources in hollow-bearing trees. Our findings underscore the importance of management practices to better protect species that decline after fire. These include conserving areas of unburned forest, particularly those with hollow-bearing trees which are critical nest sites for arboreal marsupials. These recommendations are currently the opposite of existing management practices.},

  abstract = {The validity and use of the indicator species concept, the design of logging impact studies, the need for long-term monitoring programs and how they might be designed, and, trade-offs between conservation strategies and economic costs are topics critical to the future direction of biological conservation in managed forests. The indicator species concept can make an important contribution to biodiversity conservation because of the impossibility of monitoring all taxa in species-rich forest environments. However, the concept has yet to be rigourously tested by validating relationships between an indicator species and entities for which it is hypothesized to be indicative. There can be serious negative consequences if the indicator species concept is incorrectly applied or inappropriate species are selected as indicators. Long-term monitoring will be critical for assessing not only the validity of concepts like indicator species, but also for appraising other rarely tested approaches to conservation in managed forests such as: (1) stand level management strategies to create and maintain key structural and floristic attributes that form critical habitat components for wildlife (e.g. large living and dead trees), (2) landscape level strategies to ensure the maintenance of landscape heterogeneity and connectivity, such as the establishment of networks of riparian protection zones and wildlife corridors, and, (3) landscape and regional level management involving the identification of reserves. While the importance of monitoring is often discussed, more programs are needed to gather the data needed to inform the development of ecologically sustainable forest management practices. Treating forestry activities as an experiment and overlaying well-designed monitoring pro,srams on such disturbance regimes is one useful way to accumulate key information on the effects of logging on biodiversity and how to mitigate such impacts. However, some major changes will be needed to instigate greater commitment to monitoring programs. These include: (1) identifying innovative ways to secure long-term funding that can be guaranteed beyond typical political and institutional timeframes, (2) education of funding bodies to ensure they recognise that useful results may take a prolonged period to obtain and that monitoring is not a second-rate science, (3) greater participation in the design and execution of monitoring programs by the scientific community, and, (4) stronger links among researchers and between researchers and managers to both improve the quality and validity of monitoring studies and to ensure that the results of such programs are incorporated into management practices.

  abstract = {A traditional focus in conservation biology has been on rare species as they are often those most at risk of decline or extinction. However, we argue in this paper that some kinds of currently common species also can be susceptible to decline. Those at particular risk are species that are specialized on widespread environmental conditions. Such specialization may make such species vulnerable to a range of drivers of environmental change, placing them at risk of significant decline or even local extinction. We illustrate this with a case study of the arboreal marsupial the Greater Glider (Petauroides volans) in south-eastern Australia. The Greater Glider was formerly common in two large-scale studies but in one it suffered rapid extinction (within a 3 year period) and in another it is declining at an annual rate of 8.8\%. We therefore argue for more research to better predict those kinds of currently common species which might be at risk of future rapid decline or extinction. In addition, we suggest there will often be a need to take pro-active conservation and management action to reduce the number of potential environmental stressors on populations of common species to ensure they do not become uncommon or rare. We also argue that conserving common species will ensure the retention of their key ecological and functional roles in ecosystems. Finally, we believe there is a need to develop better monitoring programs that can detect changes in the population trajectories of common species, help identify the reasons for temporal changes in such populations, and underpin timely management interventions. Despite these good intentions, we acknowledge that in one of our own long-term investigations we: (1) failed to anticipate the extremely rapid decline (and likely local extinction) of the Greater Glider, (2) were unable to diagnose the reason/s underpinning the population collapse, and (3) nor were we able to instigate a timely intervention program of management to prevent this from occurring. The key lesson from this sobering result is that common species can sometimes be at risk of rapid decline and it is wise to avoid complacency in conservation. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The Program uses competitive auctions to contract individual land managers for up to 15 years to conserve matters of National Environmental Significance (with an initial priority on nationally threatened ecological communities). The ecological monitoring was explicitly aligned with the Program's policy objective and desired outcomes and was applied to the Program's initial Project which targeted the critically endangered White Box-Yellow Box-Blakely's Red Gum Grassy Woodland and Derived Native Grassland ecological community in south eastern Australia. These woodlands have been reduced to {$<$}3\% of their original extent and persist mostly as small remnants of variable condition on private farmland. We established monitoring sites on 153 farms located over 172,232 sq km. On each farm we established a monitoring site within the woodland patch funded for management and, wherever possible, a matched control site. The monitoring has entailed gathering data on vegetation condition, reptiles and birds. We also gathered data on the costs of experimental design, site establishment, field survey, and data analysis. The costs of monitoring are approximately 8.5\% of the Program's investment in the first four years and hence are in broad accord with the general rule of thumb that 5-10\% of a program's funding should be invested in monitoring. Once initial monitoring and site benchmarking are completed we propose to implement a novel rotating sampling approach that will maintain scientific integrity while achieving an annual cost-efficiency of up to 23\%. We discuss useful lessons relevant to other monitoring programs where there is a need to provide managers with reliable early evidence of program effectiveness and to demonstrate opportunities for cost-efficiencies. © 2012 Lindenmayer et al.},

  abstract = {Hollow-bearing trees are keystone structures in many ecosystems worldwide and they play critical habitat roles for a vast array of fauna through providing denning and/or nesting sites. We quantified empirical relationships between the diameter of hollow-bearing trees and probability of occupancy of these trees by cavity-dependent arboreal marsupials in the Mountain Ash (Eucalyptus regnans) forests of the Central Highlands of Victoria, south-eastern Australia. We also quantified the effects of other variables such as stand age and elevation on tree occupancy. Finally, we compared the diameter of occupied and unoccupied hollow-bearing trees with non-hollow-bearing trees in 77-year old forest that regenerated after fires in 1939 and which form the dominant age cohort of trees in our study region. Hollow-bearing trees occupied by arboreal marsupials had a larger diameter than unoccupied hollow-bearing trees. The mean diameter of both occupied and unoccupied hollow-bearing trees was almost three times that of 1939-aged trees that did not contain hollows. Our analyses contained evidence of inter-specific differences in the diameter of hollow-bearing trees occupied by different species of arboreal marsupials. Beyond the influence on occupancy of tree-level factors such as diameter, we also found that the probability of occupancy of a hollow-bearing tree was affected by the age of the surrounding forest and landscape attributes such as elevation. The probability of occupancy of an individual hollow-bearing tree was highest when that tree was located in regrowth forest, most likely because of the scarcity of these critical nesting and denning resources in such stands. Populations of large hollow-bearing trees, including those typically selected for occupancy by arboreal marsupials, are in rapid decline in Mountain Ash forests. This decline, coupled with the prolonged period until current cohorts of existing younger trees eventually reach an age (and therefore diameter) that are suitable for occupancy by arboreal marsupials, underscores the critical need to protect all existing hollow-bearing trees from practices that can otherwise destroy them, including industrial clearfelling operations. Better protection is important not only in the small remaining areas of old growth Mountain Ash forest but also in regrowth forest where such trees are scarce and have high marginal value as nesting sites, as reflected by high rates of per tree occupancy rates in stands of this age. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {The results are reported of a nest-box study conducted in two locations in the mountain ash (Eucalyptus regnans) forests of the Central Highlands of Victoria (south-eastern Australia) to compare usage of different nest-box designs located at different heights in trees. A total of 96 nest boxes was established using a rigorous experimental design – two regions (Powelltown and Toolangi State Forests), two forest age classes (20-year post-logging regrowth and 60-year fire- and salvage-logging regrowth), two nest-box designs (large boxes with large entrance holes and small boxes with small entrance holes), and two heights at which nest boxes were attached to trees (3 m and 8 m above the ground). The study entailed setting out four nest boxes at each of 24 sites to meet the design criteria. Evidence of occupancy by vertebrates was recorded in a total of 19 of 96 boxes on 11 of 24 sites site during regular inspections over more than three years. Thirteen boxes were used by Leadbeater's possum (Gymnobelideus leadbeateri), six by the mountain brushtail possum (Trichosurus cunninghami) and seven by the common ringtail possum (Pseudocheirus peregrinus). The common ringtail possum and mountain brushtail possum were seen only in high–large boxes but Leadbeater's possum used all but the low–large boxes. There was evidence of spatial dependence in usage patterns, with all four boxes at a given site showing signs of eventually being occupied. Only two nest boxes located in mountain ash forest regenerating after the 1939 wildfires were occupied. Relatively limited use of nest boxes supports concerns about the use of a nest box over large scales and long timeframes as an effective recovery tool for species threatened by the loss and subsequent shortage in the numbers of naturally occurring hollows.},

  abstract = {Many African protected areas (PAs) are not functioning effectively. We reviewed the performance of Zambia's PA network and provide insights into how their effectiveness might be improved. Zambia's PAs are under-performing in ecological, economic and social terms. Reasons include: a) rapidly expanding human populations, poverty and open-access systems in Game Management Areas (GMAs) resulting in widespread bushmeat poaching and habitat encroachment; b) underfunding of the Zambia Wildlife Authority (ZAWA) resulting in inadequate law enforcement; c) reliance of ZAWA on extracting revenues from GMAs to cover operational costs which has prevented proper devolution of user-rights over wildlife to communities; d) on-going marginalization of communities from legal benefits from wildlife; e) under-development of the photo-tourism industry with the effect that earnings are limited to a fraction of the PA network; f) unfavourable terms and corruption which discourage good practice and adequate investment by hunting operators in GMAs; g) blurred responsibilities regarding anti-poaching in GMAs resulting in under-investment by all stakeholders. The combined effect of these challenges has been a major reduction in wildlife densities in most PAs and the loss of habitat in GMAs. Wildlife fares better in areas with investment from the private and/or NGO sector and where human settlement is absent. There is a need for: elevated government funding for ZAWA; greater international donor investment in protected area management; a shift in the role of ZAWA such that they focus primarily on national parks while facilitating the development of wildlife-based land uses by other stakeholders elsewhere; and new models for the functioning of GMAs based on joint-ventures between communities and the private and/or NGO sector. Such joint-ventures should provide defined communities with ownership of land, user-rights over wildlife and aim to attract long-term private/donor investment. These recommendations are relevant for many of the under-funded PAs occurring in other African countries.}

This paper presents a general comparison of four non-linear models for sub-pixel classification: ARTMAP, ART-MMAP, Regression Tree (RT) and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) with Back-Propagation (BP) algorithm. The comparison is based on four factors: accuracy, model complexity, interpolation ability and error distribution. Two data sets, one simulated and one real world MODIS satellite image, were used to demonstrate the characteristics of each model. Experimental results show the superior performance of MLP with the simulated data set and better performance of ARTMMAP with the MODIS data set.},

This is largely new territory that makes novel demands on governance institutions and policy. In this context, establishing and maintaining good governance across the diversity of ownership and responsibility arrangements is critical for the future effectiveness and acceptability of protected areas. Fulfilling the promise and avoiding the pitfalls inherent in contemporary protected area governance will require an understanding of what is meant by `good governance' and development of associated mechanisms to assess performance and provide a basis for improvement. This paper's contribution lies in the guidance it provides for the hitherto under-developed area of governance quality assessment. I first present a framework that positions governance quality in relation to governance and management effectiveness. I then characterize good protected area governance according to a set of seven principles - legitimacy, transparency, accountability, inclusiveness, fairness, connectivity and resilience. Together, the framework, governance principles and related performance outcomes provide a platform for assessment of governance quality for an individual terrestrial protected area, a network of several protected areas, or a national protected area system.

  abstract = {1. Control theory is a well-developed branch of mathematics and engineering that identifies optimal control policies for dynamic systems. While it should be useful for managing ecosystems, it is currently used only in certain fields of ecology and resource management, and only certain aspects of the theory are applied. Where optimal control policies have been determined, such as oceanic fisheries, the control policy often fails. 2. The goals of this study were to determine why control theory has not been used very much and why it fails, and also to improve its applicability to natural resource management. Control theory methods and assumptions were reviewed, and applications to agriculture, forestry and fisheries summarized. A comparison was made between control theory assumptions and the real ecological systems to which the method was applied. A fisheries example was developed to illustrate some improvements to the application of this technique. 3. It was shown that the paradoxical aspects of control theory in resource management result from the points of divergence of real systems from the assumptions of control theory. Because of non-linearities, noise, sampling difficulties, policy implementation error and other issues, ecosystems are neither readily observable nor easily controllable. This means that even theoretically correct control policies can lead to failure. 4. The fisheries example showed that measurement error and management lags can of themselves lead to the collapse of a fishery. It was shown that the costs of acquiring information and managing the system need to be incorporated explicitly into the control problem as decision variables. The solution to the fisheries control problem prevented extinction of the fishery by reducing sampling error and management lags to reasonable but non-zero levels. 5. Other suggestions are made for applying control theory with more success. By taking into account the deviations between the idealized control model and real systems, better resource management can be achieved. Control theory could also profitably be applied to the design of monitoring programmes, to model parameter estimation, and to other aspects of ecology and resource management where it is currently not being utilized. 6. Synthesis and applications. Control theory needs to be re-evaluated for its utility in natural resource management. It offers the potential for providing effective management policies. To achieve this potential, techniques borrowed from engineering must be expanded to incorporate the effects of state uncertainty (measurement error), environmental fluctuations (stochasticity), parameter uncertainty and policy implementation error.},

  abstract = {Censusing wild populations and detecting trends in population size over time is an important task in the conservation and management of wildlife. We compared two methods used to monitor numbers of chamois Rupicapra rupicapra and R. pyrenaica in two contrasting populations, and explored the relationship between the sampling effort and the repeatability of the results using resampling methods. One population in the Alps had been stable at a high density for several years, whereas the other population, located in the Pyrénées, was increasing exponentially, following a reintroduction. In both sites, a long-term monitoring programme based on individually marked chamois, allowed us to estimate population size using capture-mark-recapture methods (CMR). In addition, we calculated an index of population size as the mean number of animals observed on a foot transect surveyed repeatedly. We then compared whether trends estimated by each method were consistent. In the increasing population, both the index and the CMR estimates revealed an exponential increase in population size. In the stable population, neither the index nor the CMR estimate revealed any trend in size. Consistent results between the index and the CMR suggest that the index could be used to monitor trends in population size. Resampling techniques, however, pointed out that the index is only reliable when calculated over a sufficient number of surveys per year (10 in the Pyrenees, three in the Alps) and over a sufficient number of years of monitoring (about five years).},

Density estimates are calculated by overlaying slope-specific templates delineating plot boundaries and distances of known dimensions onto the digital photos to allow a distance-sampling analysis to correct for any negative bias in counts arising from a proportion of penguins being obscured. Experimental assessment of biases in density estimates because of misclassification error was {$<$} 2\% when compared to true density, indicating that this survey method is effective at accurately estimating penguin density and, therefore, abundance.},

  abstract = {Crown base height (CBH) is an essential tree biophysical parameter for many applications in forest management, forest fuel treatment, wildfire modeling, ecosystem modeling and global climate change studies. Accurate and automatic estimation of CBH for individual trees is still a challenging task. Airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) provides reliable and promising data for estimating CBH. Various methods have been developed to calculate CBH indirectly using regression-based means from airborne LiDAR data and field measurements. However, little attention has been paid to directly calculate CBH at the individual tree scale in mixed-species forests without field measurements. In this study, we propose a new method for directly estimating individual-tree CBH from airborne LiDAR data. Our method involves two main strategies: 1) removing noise and understory vegetation for each tree; and 2) estimating CBH by generating percentile ranking profile for each tree and using a spline curve to identify its inflection points. These two strategies lend our method the advantages of no requirement of field measurements and being efficient and effective in mixed-species forests. The proposed method was applied to a mixed conifer forest in the Sierra Nevada, California and was validated by field measurements. The results showed that our method can directly estimate CBH at individual tree level with a root-mean-squared error of 1.62 m, a coefficient of determination of 0.88 and a relative bias of 3.36\%. Furthermore, we systematically analyzed the accuracies among different height groups and tree species by comparing with field measurements. Our results implied that taller trees had relatively higher uncertainties than shorter trees. Our findings also show that the accuracy for CBH estimation was the highest for black oak trees, with an RMSE of 0.52 m. The conifer species results were also good with uniformly high R2 ranging from 0.82 to 0.93. In general, our method has demonstrated high accuracy for individual tree CBH estimation and strong potential for applications in mixed species over large areas.},

  abstract = {Distance sampling techniques were compared to point (variable plot) sampling and fixed-radius circular plot sampling for inventory of teak (Tectona grandis) plantations in Indonesia. n-tree distance sampling selects the n trees closest to a sample point located in the field. The distance to the nth closest tree is used as a plot radius. Two n-tree estimators were compared. Prodan (1968) described a technique for n=6, which counts the nth tree as 1/2 for tree counts and tree volume (or other tree attributes). Another approach, here called 'the (n-1)/n adjusted estimator', uses the bias correction factor (n-1)/n. Eberhardt (1967) demonstrated that the (n-1)/n adjusted estimator is unbiased for Poisson (random) and negative binomial (clumped) spatial distributions. No proof of unbiasedness is known for either method in uniform distributions which would be characteristic of plantations. n-tree sampling was performed in Indonesian teak plantations for values of n ranging from 3 to 10 for both methods. At the same locations, point (variable plot) samples with metric basal area factors 1 m(2) ha(-1) tree(-1) and 2 m(2) ha(-1) tree(-1) and fixed-radius circular plots 0.1 ha in size were installed for comparison with the n-tree distance methods. The time required for each sampling method was recorded at each field location. For each method, an efficiency ratio was calculated as (C-k(2) x Time(k))/(C-0.1ha(2) x Time(0.1ha)) where C-k is the coefficient of variation for method k, Time(k) is the average time required for method k, C-0.1 ha is the coefficient of variation for 0.1 ha plots and Time(0.1 ha) is the average time required for 0.1 ha plots. The more efficient methods have smaller efficiency ratios. According to this criterion, 5-tree distance sampling using Prodan's estimator was most efficient of the techniques compared that did not show bias for these data. The (n-1)/n adjusted estimator showed bias for these trials in teak plantations. This was probably due to the uniform spatial distribution characteristic of plantations. Point sampling with BAF=1 m(2) ha(-1) tree(-1) and BAF=2 m(2) ha(-1) tree(-1) and 0.1 ha plot sampling were not as efficient as n-tree sampling methods for these trials.

Both direct and indirect methods can be used to survey mammals, but the latter are preferred due to the difficulty to come in sight of and/or to capture the individuals, besides being cheaper. We compared the performance of two methods to survey medium and large-sized mammal: track plot recording and camera trapping, and their costs were assessed. At Jatai Ecological Station (S21 degrees 31'15 ''- W47 degrees 34'42 ''-Brazil) we installed ten camera traps along a dirt road directly in front of ten track plots, and monitored them for 10 days. We cleaned the plots, adjusted the cameras, and noted down the recorded species daily. Records taken by both methods showed they sample the local richness in different ways (Wilcoxon, T=231; p;;0.01). The track plot method performed better on registering individuals whereas camera trapping provided records which permitted more accurate species identification. The type of infra-red sensor camera used showed a strong bias towards individual body mass (R-2=0.70; p=0.017), and the variable expenses of this method in a 10-day survey were estimated about 2.04 times higher compared to track plot method; however, in a long run camera trapping becomes cheaper than track plot recording. Concluding, track plot recording is good enough for quick surveys under a limited budget, and camera trapping is best for precise species identification and the investigation of species details, performing better for large animals. When used together, these methods can be complementary.},

  abstract = {Summary 1 The fraction of sampling units in a landscape where a target species is present (occupancy) is an extensively used concept in ecology. Yet in many applications the species will not always be detected in a sampling unit even when present, resulting in biased estimates of occupancy. Given that sampling units are surveyed repeatedly within a relatively short timeframe, a number of similar methods have now been developed to provide unbiased occupancy estimates. However, practical guidance on the efficient design of occupancy studies has been lacking. 2 In this paper we comment on a number of general issues related to designing occupancy studies, including the need for clear objectives that are explicitly linked to science or management, selection of sampling units, timing of repeat surveys and allocation of survey effort. Advice on the number of repeat surveys per sampling unit is considered in terms of the variance of the occupancy estimator, for three possible study designs. 3 We recommend that sampling units should be surveyed a minimum of three times when detection probability is high ({$>~$}0·5 survey?1), unless a removal design is used. 4 We found that an optimal removal design will generally be the most efficient, but we suggest it may be less robust to assumption violations than a standard design. 5 Our results suggest that for a rare species it is more efficient to survey more sampling units less intensively, while for a common species fewer sampling units should be surveyed more intensively. 6 Synthesis and applications. Reliable inferences can only result from quality data. To make the best use of logistical resources, study objectives must be clearly defined; sampling units must be selected, and repeated surveys timed appropriately; and a sufficient number of repeated surveys must be conducted. Failure to do so may compromise the integrity of the study. The guidance given here on study design issues is particularly applicable to studies of species occurrence and distribution, habitat selection and modelling, metapopulation studies and monitoring programmes.},

We review methods of evaluating change in biodiversity at the community level using these datasets, and contrast whole-community approaches with those that combine information from different species and habitats. As all communities experience temporal turnover, one of the biggest challenges is distinguishing change that can be attributed to external factors, such as anthropogenic activities, from underlying natural change. We also discuss methodological issues, such as false alerts and modifications in design, of which users of these data sets need to be aware.},

Analysis of the largest survey dataset ever assembled for forest elephants (80 foot-surveys; covering 13,000 km; 91,600 person-days of fieldwork) revealed that population size declined by ca. 62\% between 2002–2011, and the taxon lost 30\% of its geographical range. The population is now less than 10\% of its potential size, occupying less than 25\% of its potential range. High human population density, hunting intensity, absence of law enforcement, poor governance, and proximity to expanding infrastructure are the strongest predictors of decline. To save the remaining African forest elephants, illegal poaching for ivory and encroachment into core elephant habitat must be stopped. In addition, the international demand for ivory, which fuels illegal trade, must be dramatically reduced.},

  abstract = {Estimating population abundance of marine turtles on their feeding grounds is needed to implement effective conservation strategies, but is logistically challenging. In-water monitoring surveys on feeding grounds are costly, time-consuming, stressful to the animals (when capture is required), and typically requires complex analytical skills. Here, we compare two sampling methods to estimate abundance of green turtles on one of their major feeding grounds in the Egyptian Red Sea: a) snorkelling strip transect counts, a rarely used method on marine turtles; and b) capture-mark-recapture (CMR) using photo-identification. The main goals of this research were to: 1) identify the most cost-effective method to estimate in-water marine turtle abundance; and 2) provide the first abundance estimates for green turtles on their feeding grounds in the Red Sea. Both methods produced an average monthly abundance of approximately 30 turtles, with no significant difference between the two methodologies. The strip-transect method presented major logistical advantages, including easy field implementation, simple equipment, and only basic analytical skills. Furthermore, this method provided density estimates that can be used as index for population trends. However, limitations of this method included intensive field effort and potentially altered turtle behaviour due to the presence of the observers. By contrast, photo-identification and CMR models provided valuable information of population demography but required advanced analytical skills, did not provide a measure of density, and could prove challenging in areas where turtles are not acclimated to human presence. Our results suggest that the ease data collection and associated analysis of the strip transect method should be considered when implementing a monitoring program of wildlife to be used for management and conservation purposes.

Information on the species has been based primarily on non-systematic surveys, and the corresponding status estimates are of unknown quality. We evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of two field methods for systematic surveys of populations of Cuvier's gazelle in arid environments: distance sampling (based on sightings) and sampling indirect sign (tracks and scats). The work was carried out in the north-western Sahara Desert, in Morocco, where what is possibly the largest population of Cuvier's gazelle persists. A logistically viable survey was conducted over a total area of c. 20.000 km(2) in 10 expeditions during 2011-2014. A total of 67 sites were surveyed, with 194 walking surveys (2,169 km in total). Gazelle signs were detected at 50 sites, and gazelles were sighted at 21 sites (61 individuals). We found a relationship between sightings and abundance indices based on indirect sign, which could be useful for population monitoring or ecological studies. Additionally, the data could be used in occupancy modelling. Density estimates based on distance sampling required considerable effort; however, it is possible to survey large areas during relatively short campaigns, and this proved to be the most useful approach to obtain data on the demographic structure of the population.},

The alternatives were evaluated based on how well they estimated the number of hardwoods and snags per hectare and their basal area per hectare using root mean square error and percent bias. In general, 3.6-m wide systematic strips oriented perpendicular to the stream outperformed the other alternatives. However, the variance of all six sampling alternatives was quite high and further research is needed to determine an optimal sampling method for quantifying hardwood and snag attributes in forests dominated by live conifers. When sampling snag and hardwood as a minor component of the overall forest composition within a riparian area, we suggest using 3.6-m strips perpendicular to the stream.},

Some of these species produce readily identifiable sounds, providing an opportunity to use passive acoustic data to estimate animal density. In addition, even for species for which other visually based methods are feasible, passive acoustic methods offer the potential for greater detection ranges in some environments (e.g. underwater or in dense forest), and hence potentially better precision.

  abstract = {1 Accurate and precise estimates of abundance are required for the development of management regimes for deer populations. In woodland areas, indirect dung count methods, such as the clearance plot and standing crop methods, are currently the preferred procedures to estimate deer abundance. The use of line transect methodology is likely to provide a cost-effective alternative to these methods. 2 We outline a methodology based on line transect surveys of deer dung that can be used to obtain deer abundance estimates by geographical block and habitat type. Variance estimation procedures are also described. 3 As an example, we applied the method to estimate sika deer Cervus nippon abundance in south Scotland. Estimates of deer defecation and length of time to dung decay were used to convert pellet group density to deer density by geographical block and habitat type. The results obtained agreed with knowledge from cull and sightings data, and the precision of the estimates was generally high. 4 Relatively high sika deer densities observed in moorland areas up to 300 m from the forest edge indicated the need to encompass those areas in future surveys to avoid an underestimate of deer abundance in the region of interest. 5 It is unlikely that a single method for estimating deer abundance will prove to be better under all circumstances. Direct comparisons between methods are required to evaluate thoroughly the relative merits of each of them. 6 Line transect surveys of dung are becoming a widely used tool to aid management and conservation of a wide range of species. The survey methodology we outline is readily adaptable to other vertebrates that are amenable to dung survey methodology.},

An implicit assumption of standard line transect methodology is that detection probabilities depend solely on the perpendicular distance of detected objects to the transect line. Heterogeneity in detection probabilities is commonly minimized using stratification, but this may be precluded by small sample sizes. We develop a general methodology which allows the effects of multiple covariates to be directly incorporated into the estimation procedure using a conditional likelihood approach. Small sample size properties of estimators are examined via simulations. As an example the method is applied to eastern tropical Pacific dolphin sightings data.},

  abstract = {Line transect sampling is one of the most widely used methods for animal abundance assessment. Standard estimation methods assume certain detection on the transect, no animal movement, and no measurement errors. Failure of the assumptions can cause substantial bias. In this work, the effect of error measurement on line transect estimators is investigated. Based on considerations of the process generating the errors, a multiplicative error model is presented and a simple way of correcting estimates based on knowledge of the error distribution is proposed. Using beta models for the error distribution, the effect of errors and of the proposed correction is assessed by simulation. Adequate confidence intervals for the corrected estimates are obtained using a bootstrap variance estimate for the correction and the delta method. As noted by Chen (1998, Biometrics 54, 899-908), even unbiased estimators of the distances might lead to biased density estimators, depending on the actual error distribution. In contrast with the findings of Chen, who used an additive model, unbiased estimation of distances, given a multiplicative model, lead to overestimation of density. Some error distributions result in observed distance distributions that make efficient estimation impossible, by removing the shoulder present in the original detection function. This indicates the need to improve field methods to reduce measurement error. An application of the new methods to a real data set is presented.},

The efficacy of each method is evaluated to produce a simple selection guide. We review the literature and use field data from the Udzungwa Mountains, Tanzania. The review is relevant to all group-living animals; however, examples are drawn from the primates. Perpendicular methods have better mathematical justification than non-perpendicular methods. For perpendicular methods using detection function models, it is preferable to measure group location using center of measurable individuals, as group centers are hard to estimate. The assumptions of detection function models are often broken in poor visibility habitats or with unhabituated animals. Alternatively strip transects may be used where there are reliable data on group spread and/or visibility. Strip transects are also the most practical, along with the animal–observer method; however, the latter lacks mathematical justification. We conclude that there are arguments for continued use of all four methods. In certain situations the use of raw encounter rates may also be considered. The appropriate method is determined by minimizing bias and considering time, resources and field conditions. Am. J. Primatol. 70:452–462, 2008. © 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

However, few studies have coped with the social-cultural dimension of ecosystem services, despite being considered a research priority. We examined how ecosystem service bundles and trade-offs emerge from diverging social preferences toward ecosystem services delivered by various types of ecosystems in Spain. We conducted 3,379 direct face-to-face questionnaires in eight different case study sites from 2007 to 2011. Overall, 90.5\% of the sampled population recognized the ecosystem's capacity to deliver services. Formal studies, environmental behavior, and gender variables influenced the probability of people recognizing the ecosystem's capacity to provide services. The ecosystem services most frequently perceived by people were regulating services; of those, air purification held the greatest importance. However, statistical analysis showed that socio-cultural factors and the conservation management strategy of ecosystems (i.e., National Park, Natural Park, or a non-protected area) have an effect on social preferences toward ecosystem services. Ecosystem service trade-offs and bundles were identified by analyzing social preferences through multivariate analysis (redundancy analysis and hierarchical cluster analysis). We found a clear trade-off among provisioning services (and recreational hunting) versus regulating services and almost all cultural services. We identified three ecosystem service bundles associated with the conservation management strategy and the rural-urban gradient. We conclude that socio-cultural preferences toward ecosystem services can serve as a tool to identify relevant services for people, the factors underlying these social preferences, and emerging ecosystem service bundles and trade-offs.}

  abstract = {Ghanaians have a long history in ivory, both for export and for carving. From the 1970s to the early 1990s, however, most of Ghana's elephant were killed either by local farmers in retribution for human-elephant conflict or by poachers for the ivory trade. Ghanaian ivory craftsmen used the tusks primarily to make jewellery and figurines over this time. These curios were mostly sold in Accra, the capital, but due to lack of market surveys, very little data are available. In July 2010 I surveyed the retail outlets selling ivory in Accra and counted only 10 items on display in an art gallery and 85 items brought to me in five of 186 souvenir shops and stalls I visited. The reason there were so few items was that the Ghana Police Service and Wildlife Division of the Forestry Commission had carried out a raid in November 2008 in the main curio market confiscating several hundred kilos of ivory items, fining and imprisoning the dealers. Since then the vendors in Accra have feared to sell ivory. Elephant poaching declined at the start of the 21st century thanks to improved law enforcement. In 2004 a new system was introduced that involves performance and adaptive management through the monitoring of patrol effort and observations by the field-staff in the Wildlife Division. The combined effect of performance and adaptive management was that the number of effective days spent in the field by an average Wildlife Guard doubled, which dramatically lowered the number of elephants killed illegally. In addition, governance improved, Ghanaians developed greater respect for the law and there was less corruption, which reduced elephant poaching and the sale of ivory objects. This paper concludes that Ghanaian examples of greater patrol staff performance through improved monitoring-and of successfully raiding outlets selling illegal ivory-are a sound approach to reducing elephant poaching. While improving anti-poaching exercises is more difficult in some African range States, the Ghanaian example of shop raids is easier to implement and has also worked in countries such as Cameroon and Ethiopia. Other countries in Africa, especially Cote d'Ivoire, Democratic Republic of Congo, Nigeria and Senegal, need to follow the example of Ghana in carrying out official raids on ivory in retail outlets.},

  abstract = {Commonalities and complementarities among approaches to conservation monitoring and evaluation (M\&E) are not well articulated, creating the potential for confusion, misuse, and missed opportunities to inform conservation policy and practice. We examine the relationships among five approaches to conservation M\&E, characterizing each approach in eight domains: the focal question driving each approach, when in the project cycle each approach is employed, scale of data collection, the methods of data collection and analysis, the implementers of data collection and analysis, the users of M\&E outputs, and the decisions informed by these outputs. Ambient monitoring measures status and change in ambient social and ecological conditions, independent of any conservation intervention. Management assessment measures management inputs, activities, and outputs, as the basis for investments to build management capacity for conservation projects. Performance measurement assesses project or program progress toward desired levels of specific activities, outputs, and outcomes. Impact evaluation is the systematic process of measuring the intended and unintended causal effects of conservation interventions, with emphasis upon long-term impacts on ecological and social conditions. Systematic review examines existing research findings to assess the state of the evidence regarding the impacts of conservation interventions, and to synthesize the insights emerging from this evidence base. Though these five approaches have some commonalities, they complement each other to provide unique insights for conservation planning, capacity-building, adaptive management, learning, and accountability. Ambient monitoring, management assessment, and performance measurement are now commonplace in conservation, but opportunities remain to inform conservation policy and practice more fully through catalytic investments in impact evaluations and systematic reviews.

It is difficult to judge the benefit of management actions that accelerate information gain, relative to the benefit of making the best management decision given what is known at the time. We present a first step in developing methods to optimize management decisions that incorporate both uncertainty and learning via adaptive management We assumed a manager can allocate effort to discrete units (e.g., areas for revegetation or animals for reintroduction), the outcome can be measured as success or failure (e.g., the revegetation in an area is successful or the animal survives and breeds), and the manager has two possible management options from which to choose. We further assumed that there is an annual budget that may be allocated to one or both of the two options and that the manager must decide on the allocation. We used Bayesian updating of the probability of success of the two options and stochastic dynamic programming to determine the optimal strategy over a specified number of years, The costs, level of certainty about the success of the two options, and the timeframe of management all influenced the optimal allocation of the annual budget. In addition, the choice of management objective had a large influence on the optimal decision. In a case study of Merri Creek, Melbourne, Australia, we applied the approach to determining revegetation strategies. Our approach can be used to determine how best to manage ecological systems in the face of uncertainty.},

Species can be difficult to detect when rare but, in general, how detection probabilities vary with abundance is unknown. We developed a new detectability model based on the time to detection of the first individual of a species. Based on this model, the predicted detection rate is proportional to a power function of abundance with a scaling exponent between zero and one that depends on clustering of individuals. We estimated the model parameters with data from three independent datasets: searches for chenopod shrub species and coins, experimental searches for planted seedlings, and frog surveys at multiple sites in sub-tropical forests of eastern Australia. Analyses based on the detection time and detection probability suggest that detection rate increases with abundance as predicted. The model provides a way to scale detection rates to cases of low abundance when direct estimation of detection rates is often impractical.},

Heuristic properties can suggest preferred indices, but we lack objective ways to discriminate between indices with similar heuristics. Biodiversity indices can be evaluated by determining how well they reflect management objectives that a monitoring program aims to support. For example, the Convention on Biological Diversity requires reporting about extinction rates, so simple indices that reflect extinction risk would be valuable. We developed 3 biodiversity indices that are based on simple models of population viability that relate extinction risk to abundance. We based the first index on the geometric mean abundance of species and the second on a more general power mean. In a third index, we integrated the geometric mean abundance and trend. These indices require the same data as previous indices, but they also relate directly to extinction risk. Field data for butterflies and woodland plants and experimental studies of protozoan communities show that the indices correlate with local extinction rates. Applying the index based on the geometric mean to global data on changes in avian abundance suggested that the average extinction probability of birds has increased approximately 1\% from 1970 to 2009., Conectando Índices para el Monitoreo de la Biodiversidad con la Teoría de Riesgo de Extinción},

  abstract = {This paper reviews the literature concerning forest and woodland structure at the scale of an individual stand. Stand structure is defined in terms of structural attributes and stand structural complexity. Stand structural complexity is considered to be a measure of the number of different attributes present and the relative abundance of each of these attributes. The review indicates there is no definitive suite of structural attributes; different authors emphasise subsets of different attributes, and relatively few studies provide quantitative evidence linking attributes to the provision of faunal habitat or other measures of biodiversity, although a number of studies identify attributes that distinguish between successional stages. A summary of key structural attributes identified in the literature is presented under the following stand elements: foliage arrangement, canopy cover, tree diameter, tree height, tree spacing, tree species, stand biomass, understorey vegetation, and deadwood. Indices of structural complexity are also reviewed. Three types of index framework are identified: indices based on the cumulative score of attributes; indices based on the average score of groups of attributes; and indices based on the interaction of attributes. The review identifies a variety of different indices under each of these frameworks with no single index preferred over the others. The most prominent of these indices are discussed in detail and the following guidelines suggested for the development of an index of structural complexity: (1) Start with a comprehensive set of structural attributes, in which there is a demonstrated association between attributes and the elements of biodiversity that are of interest. (2) Use a simple mathematical system to construct the index; this facilitates the use of multiple attributes and interpretation of the index in terms of real stand conditions. (3) Score attributes relative to the range of values occurring in stands of a comparable vegetation community. (4) Try different weightings of attributes in the index, adopting those weightings which most clearly distinguish between stands.},

  abstract = {Context Monitoring is a key component in managing wildlife populations and is critical for revealing long-term population trends of endangered species. Cryptic or highly mobile species that occur in low densities and in remote terrain require the development of specific monitoring methods. The southern cassowary is an Australian endangered species that poses many challenges for conducting population surveys. Aims The aims of the present study were to determine the effectiveness of camera traps in detecting cassowaries at a site, to determine whether visual lures increased detection rates, and to explore the potential of camera traps in population surveys. Methods Coloured lures (mimicking large blue and red fruit) were placed in front of a set of camera traps and compared with controls (no lures) at 29 survey sites on the Daintree coast, northern Queensland, Australia. Key results Camera traps with lures (1) detected more birds, (2) had a shorter detection latency, (3) had a marginally greater number of captures, (4) experienced a longer capture duration, (5) were more likely to have the cassowary stop in front of the camera, and (6) achieved a 95\% probability of detecting cassowaries in 12 trap days, compared with 28 trap days without lures. Conclusions An increase in the number of cassowaries detected, the reduction in camera latency times and the ability to identify the birds enables a more efficient approach to estimating population sizes over existing methods. This is the first published study to use visual lures to conduct camera trapping of birds. Implications The use of camera traps with lures is a practical and cost-efficient technique for the rapid detection of cassowaries at a site and lends itself to studies of population structure, size and trends.},

  abstract = {The trade in wildlife products can represent an important source of income for poor people, but also threaten wildlife locally, regionally and internationally. Bushmeat provides livelihoods for hunters, traders and sellers, protein to rural and urban consumers, and has depleted the populations of many tropical forest species. Management interventions can be targeted towards the consumers or suppliers of wildlife products. There has been a general assumption in the bushmeat literature that the urban trade is driven by consumer demand with hunters simply fulfilling this demand. Using the urban bushmeat trade in the city of Kumasi, Ghana, as a case study, we use a range of datasets to explore the processes driving the urban bushmeat trade. We characterise the nature of supply and demand by explicitly considering three market attributes: resource condition, hunter behaviour, and consumer behaviour. Our results suggest that bushmeat resources around Kumasi are becoming increasingly depleted and are unable to meet demand, that hunters move in and out of the trade independently of price signals generated by the market, and that, for the Kumasi bushmeat system, consumption levels are driven not by consumer choice but by shortfalls in supply and consequent price responses. Together, these results indicate that supply-side processes dominate the urban bushmeat trade in Kumasi. This suggests that future management interventions should focus on changing hunter behaviour, although complementary interventions targeting consumer demand are also likely to be necessary in the long term. Our approach represents a structured and repeatable method to assessing market dynamics in information-poor systems. The findings serve as a caution against assuming that wildlife markets are demand driven, and highlight the value of characterising market dynamics to informappropriate management.},

  abstract = {Landscapes in many developing countries consist of a heterogeneous matrix of mixed agriculture and forest. Many of the generalist species in this matrix are increasingly traded in the bushmeat markets of West and Central Africa. However, to date there has been little quantification of how the spatial configuration of the landscape influences the urban bushmeat trade over time. As anthropogenic landscapes become the face of rural West Africa, understanding the dynamics of these systems has important implications for conservation and landscape management. The bushmeat production of an area is likely to be defined by landscape characteristics such as habitat disturbance, hunting pressure, level of protection, and distance to market. We explored (SSG, tense) the role of these four characteristics in the spatio-temporal dynamics of the commercial bushmeat trade around the city of Kumasi, Ghana, over 27 years (1978 to 2004). We used geographic information system methods to generate maps delineating the spatial characteristics of the landscapes. These data were combined with spatially explicit market data collected in the main fresh bushmeat market in Kumasi to explore the relationship between trade volume (measured in terms of number of carcasses) and landscape characteristics. Over time, rodents, specifically cane rats (Thryonomys swinderianus), became more abundant in the trade relative to ungulates and the catchment area of the bushmeat market expanded. Areas of intermediate disturbance supplied more bushmeat, but protected areas had no effect. Heavily hunted areas showed significant declines in bushmeat supply over time. Our results highlight the role that low intensity, heterogeneous agricultural landscapes can play in providing ecosystem services, such as bushmeat, and therefore the importance of incorporating bushmeat into ecosystem service mapping exercises. Our results also indicate that even where high bushmeat production is possible, current harvest levels may cause wildlife depletion.},

  abstract = {The increasing economic and environmental losses caused by non-native invasive species amplify the value of identifying and implementing optimal management options to prevent, detect, and control invasive species. Previous literature has focused largely on preventing introductions of invasive species and post-detection control activities; few have addressed the role of detection. By increasing resources to detect invasive species, managers may increase their chances of finding a species at a smaller population level, lessening the extent of damages and making subsequent control potentially less expensive and more effective. However, detecting new invasive species is difficult and uncertain; many factors reduce the likelihood of successful detection, such as low population densities which are prevalent in invasive species management. This paper presents a model that captures the stochastic and dynamic aspects of this trade-off by incorporating a detection stage in which the agency managers choose search effort prior to the post-detection control stage. The analysis of the model illustrates that the optimal detection strategy depends primarily on the ‘detectability’, or ease of detection, and the biological relationships of each distinct species.

  abstract = {Aim: To analyse the conservation status of tropical dry forests at the global scale, by combining a newly developed global distribution map with spatial data describing different threats, and to identify the relative exposure of different forest areas to such threats. Location: Global assessment. Methods: We present a new global distribution map of tropical dry forest derived from the recently developed MODIS Vegetation Continuous Fields (VCF) product, which depicts percentage tree cover at a resolution of 500 m, combined with previously defined maps of biomes. This distribution map was overlaid with spatial data to estimate the exposure of tropical dry forests to a number of different threats: climate change, habitat fragmentation, fire, human population density and conversion to cropland. The extent of tropical dry forest currently protected was estimated by overlaying the forest map with a global data set of the distribution of protected areas. Results: It is estimated that 1,048,700 km(2) of tropical dry forest remains, distributed throughout the three tropical regions. More than half of the forest area (54.2\%) is located within South America, the remaining area being almost equally divided between North and Central America, Africa and Eurasia, with a relatively small proportion (3.8\%) occurring within Australasia and Southeast Asia. Overall, c. 97\% of the remaining area of tropical dry forest is at risk from one or more of the threats considered, with highest percentages recorded for Eurasia. The relative exposure to different threats differed between regions: while climate change is relatively significant in the Americas, habitat fragmentation and fire affect a higher proportion of African forests, whereas agricultural conversion and human population density are most influential in Eurasia. Evidence suggests that c. 300,000 km(2) of tropical dry forest now coincide with some form of protected area, with 71.8\% of this total being located within South America. Main conclusions: Virtually all of the tropical dry forests that remain are currently exposed to a variety of different threats, largely resulting from human activity. Taking their high biodiversity value into consideration, this indicates that tropical dry forests should be accorded high conservation priority. The results presented here could be used to identify which forest areas should be accorded highest priority for conservation action. In particular, the expansion of the global protected area network, particularly in Mesoamerica, should be given urgent consideration.},

It is derived from a document prepared by TRAFFIC, the wildlife trade monitoring network, for the 14th meeting of the Conference of the Parties to CITES in June 2007. The volume of horn entering illegal trade from Africa has increased significantly since 2000, indicating ongoing market demand and organized trade routes to the Middle and Far East. Through law enforcement, range States collectively recovered 42\% of the potential number of rhino horns moving into illicit trade, but a minimum of 386 horns are believed to have evaded detection and were lost to illegal trade. Poached rhinos continue to supply most horns, with at least 252 rhinos detected as illegally killed during 2000-2005. However, prominence has been rising of horns acquired and laundered from private stockpiles and from legally hunted white rhinos in South Africa. With effective metapopulation management strategies, most range States in Africa have minimized poaching to levels at which their overall rhino populations continue to increase in numbers. Two notable exceptions are the Democratic Republic of Congo and Zimbabwe, where respectively 59\% and 12\% of their 2003 rhino populations were illegally killed during 2003-2005. Where illegal activities have escalated in key rhino range States, two important factors limiting management effectiveness are the increased levels of criminal organization and a breakdown of socio-economic stability and governance. TRAFFIC recommends renewed international attention following recent CITES decisions, with a focus on problems in DRC, South Africa and Zimbabwe.},

  abstract = {Spatial models of density and abundance are widely used in both ecological research (e.g., to study habitat use) and wildlife management (e.g., for population monitoring and environmental impact assessment). Increasingly, modellers are tasked with integrating data from multiple sources, collected via different observation processes. Distance sampling is an efficient and widely used survey and analysis technique. Within this framework, observation processes are modelled via detection functions. We seek to take multiple data sources and fit them in a single spatial model. Density surface models (DSMs) are a two-stage approach: first accounting for detectability via distance sampling methods, then modelling distribution via a generalized additive model. However, current software and theory does not address the issue of multiple data sources. We extend the DSM approach to accommodate data from multiple surveys, collected via conventional distance sampling, double-observer distance sampling (used to account for incomplete detection at zero distance) and strip transects. Variance propagation ensures that uncertainty is correctly accounted for in final estimates of abundance. Methods described here are implemented in the dsm R package. We briefly analyse two datasets to illustrate these new developments. Our new methodology enables data from multiple distance sampling surveys of different types to be treated in a single spatial model, enabling more robust abundance estimation, potentially over wider geographical or temporal domains.},

We outline the general principles that have guided data integration methods and review recent developments in the field. We then outline key areas that allow for a more general framework for integrating data and provide suggestions for improving sampling design and validation for integrated models. Key to recent advances has been using point-process thinking to combine estimators developed for different data types. Extending this framework to new data types will further improve our inferences, as well as relaxing assumptions about how parameters are jointly estimated. These along with the better use of information regarding sampling effort and spatial autocorrelation will further improve our inferences. Recent developments form a strong foundation for implementation of data integration models. Wider adoption can improve our inferences about species distributions and the dynamic processes that lead to distributional shifts.},

Strategies that meet a stock conservation criterion under a base case scenario are subjected to a set of robustness trials, including biased and highly variable abundance estimates and poaching. Strategy performance is assessed with respect to a conservation criterion, the revenues achieved and their variability. Strategies that harvest heavily, even when the population is apparently very large, perform badly in the robustness trials. Setting a threshold below which harvesting does not take place, and above which all individuals are harvested, does not provide effective protection against over-harvesting. Strategies that rely on population growth rates rather than estimates of population size are more robust to biased estimates. The strategies that are most robust to uncertainty are simple, involving harvesting a relatively small proportion of the population each year. The simulation modelling approach to exploring harvesting strategies is suggested as a useful tool for the assessment of the performance of competing strategies under uncertainty.},

To investigate the probability distribution of trees in natural stands, 642 trees were selected for measurement using a systematic random sampling method. Selected trees were measured and data were analyzed. Gamma, beta, normal, lognormal, exponential and Weibull probability distributions were fitted to the height distribution of trees. Variables of distribution functions were estimated using the maximum likelihood estimation method. Actual probability and probability which derived from functions was compared using Kolmogorov–Smirnov and Anderson–Darling tests. Beta, Weibull and Weibull probability distributions explained the distributions of tree height, DBH and crown area.},

  abstract = {Game species monitoring using road based distance sampling in association with thermal imagers: a covariate analysis.-Monitoring of game species populations is necessary to adequately assess culling by hunters in areas where natural large predators are absent. However, game managers have to control several species and they often lack of an efficient and convenient survey design method. Monitoring several species at that same time over large areas could thus be cost- and time-effective. We tested the influence of several factors during monitoring of three common game species, (wild boar, roe deer and red fox, using road based distance sampling in association with thermal imagers. This pilot survey based on 20 night counts in five contrasting sites studied the effect of several covariates (species, thermal imaging, observer, group size, and habitat type) on the detection probabilities (= dp). No differences were observed between thermal imagers (do(JENOPTIK): 0-186, dP(FLIR): 0.193) and group sizes (dp(1ind): 0.243, dp(2ind) : 0.259, dp({$>$}2ind): 0.223), but we found differences between observers (dp(obs1): 0.207, dp(obs2): 0.274, dp(obs3): 0.159). Expected differences were also observed between species (dp(wild boar): 0.22, dp(roe deer): 0.35, dp(red fox): 0.32) and between habitat type (dp(forest): 0.27, dp(edge): 0.74, dp(open): 0.35). Our results show that the detectability of low cost thermal imaging equipment is similar to that of more expensive methods, highlighting new possibilities for the use of thermal imagery by game managers. Although adjustments should be made to the study design our findings suggest that large scale multi species monitoring could be an efficient method for common game species.},

  abstract = {The traditional sampling method for estimating frequency (the number of sub-quadrats containing a basal part of the organisms) is compared, using both computer simulations and direct comparison in the field, to two new methods that use a compound series of variable-sized concentric sub-quadrats. Both the new frequency-score and the new importance-score methods are closer approximations of density than is the standard frequency method, and the estimates produced by both of the new methods are less affected by the choice of sub-quadrat size and the spatial distribution (dispersion) of the organisms (i.e. clumping and regularity). Thus, the two nested-quadrat methods appear to ameliorate the usual frequency limitations associated with sub-quadrat size and organism dispersion, by the use of a range of different sub-quadrat sizes. This is important in community studies, where the component species may show a wide range of densities and dispersions. Both of the new methods are easily employed in the field. The importance-score method involves no more sampling effort than does standard qualitative (presenceabsence) sampling, and it can therefore be used to sample a larger quadrat area than would normally be used for frequency sampling. This makes the method much more cost-effective as a means of estimating abundance, and it allows a greater number of the rarer species to be included in the sampling. The frequency-score method is more time-consuming, but it is capable of detecting more subtle community patterns. This means that it is particularly useful for the study of species-poor communities or where small variations in composition need to be detected.},

  abstract = {In this essay, I make the case that our studies of wildlife and habitat are largely decoupled from any meaningful relationship to the distribution of the study species. The field that we broadly classify as wildlifehabitat relationships is characterized by an increasing number of studies that gather additional data on phenomena that are already well studied. I offer that unless we make changes to the fundamental aspect of study design, our studies will fail to advance conservation of species. The current habitat sampling and analysis paradigm involves identification of a convenient study area, drawing samples from the usual list of parameters, conducting a series of statistical analyses, comparing findings to other studies, and justifying publication by extrapolating findings to some unspecified larger area. Recommendations for management are usually vague and are seldom tested for efficacy. Most of our habitat studies have little relevance to the target species with regard to viability. Attempts to translate the best scientific information into a set of management guidelines for a species produce one size fits all documents. I describe how we usually compromise our studies well before data collection by failing to establish a cogent framework for sampling from an ecologically meaningful unit of a population, but rather sample based on funding priorities and convenience. Specifying the sampling universe for a species sets the stage for properly establishing the sampling frame. Although we always have a target population, that target is often the result of personal, political, or administrative interest, but has little to do with biological reality. I review various intraspecies levels that could be a focus for study, including subspecies and especially ecotypes. Although making assumptions about our study species and habitat parameters is a necessary step, carrying forward untested assumptions from previous studies and failing to test new ones substantially negates the application of research results to meaningful management actions. I include recommendations for enhancing studies of wildlife and habitat with the intent of altering the current norm of wildlifehabitat studies. (c) 2012 The Wildlife Society.},

A predictive equation for estimating dung bolus diameters from elephants of known age was derived and was found to follow the typical growth pattern exhibited by changes in shoulder height and foot length. The relationship between measurements of dung bolus and age was particularly strong when growth rates were high (age 0–25 years). The dung bolus growth curve from Amboseli elephants was similar to that derived from another wild population of African elephants, suggesting that dung bolus diameter can be used to assess age structure in areas where it is impossible to construct independent prediction curves of age and dung bolus.},

  abstract = {The distribution, habitat and conservation status of Notomys fuscus were determined by collating past records of the species and conducting field investigations covering areas of historical distribution and similar habitats. Detailed population sampling was carried out in two geographically distinct locations where populations appeared to be extant. Evidence of N. fuscus was found throughout the Strzelecki Desert east and south of the Strzelecki Creek in South Australia and in an isolated group of dunes south-east of the Diamantina River in south-west Queensland. Populations were located in a variety of sand dune habitats (excepting those dominated by Triodia) throughout these areas, implying that the species is a habitat-generalist with a preference for a sandy substrate. Eight floristic groups were identified from the 66 sites sampled, three of which supported N. fuscus populations. These ranged from extremely degraded dune and sand plain systems in the southern Strzelecki Desert, supporting mostly ephemeral plants, to well-vegetated dunes covered by sandhill canegrass,Zygochloa paradoxa, in south-west Queensland. However, the results suggest that the presence of consolidated dunes and perennial vegetation are important for the maintenance of stable populations. Relatively dense populations of N. fuscus were recorded only in the vicinity of major drainage systems. It is hypothesised that the higher nutrient status of the soils surrounding such systems may be an important factor affecting the distribution of N. fuscus. The study reaffirmed the species’ decline since European settlement of Australia, and recommends that the present vulnerable status of the species (IUCN Species Survival Commission (SSC) Rodent Specialist Group) be maintained.},

Population parameters of N. fuscus differed markedly between the two study sites. Whilst the population at Montecollina Bore exhibited large fluctuations in size, captures at Pelican Waterhole were lower but more consistent. Recaptures between sessions at Montecollina Bore peaked at 60\% but no individuals were recaptured at Pelican Waterhole. No evidence of seasonal breeding was recorded at either site. Male N. fuscus captured at Montecollina Bore were significantly heavier (average 31.4 g) than Pelican Waterhole animals (average 26.6 g). Over a 1–4-night period, the maximum linear distance moved by radio-collared individuals was 1.5 km (average 481 m) at Pelican Waterhole and 400 m (average 199 m) at Montecollina Bore. Differences in population dynamics between the two sites are ascribed to food availability and habitat quality. Whilst Pelican Waterhole may constitute a more stable, less degraded environment, Montecollina Bore appears to be defined by periods of either very high or very low resource availability depending on rainfall. The abundance of dingoes and low cat and fox activity may contribute to the persistence of N. fuscus at the two study sites.},

  abstract = {Tropical forests host at least two-thirds of the world’s flora and fauna diversity and store 25\% of the terrestrial above and belowground carbon. However, biodiversity decline due to deforestation and forest degradation of tropical forest is increasing at an alarming rate. Biodiversity dynamics due to natural and anthropogenic disturbances are mainly monitored using established field survey approaches. However, such approaches appear to fall short at addressing complex disturbance factors and responses. We argue that the integration of state-of-the-art monitoring approaches can improve the detection of subtle biodiversity disturbances and responses in changing tropical forests, which are often data-poor. We assess the state-of-the-art technologies used to monitor biodiversity dynamics of changing tropical forests, and how their potential integration can increase the detail and accuracy of biodiversity monitoring. Moreover, the relevance of these biodiversity monitoring techniques in support of the UNCBD Aichi targets was explored using the Essential Biodiversity Variables (EBVs) as a framework. Our review indicates that although established field surveys were generally the dominant monitoring systems employed, the temporal trend of monitoring approaches indicates the increasing application of remote sensing and in -situ sensors in detecting disturbances related to agricultural activities, logging, hunting and infrastructure. The relevance of new technologies (i.e., remote sensing, in situ sensors, and DNA barcoding) in operationalising EBVs (especially towards the ecosystem structure, ecosystem function, and species population classes) and the Aichi targets has been assessed. Remote sensing application is limited for EBV classes such as genetic composition and species traits but was found most suitable for ecosystem structure class. The complementarity of remote sensing and emerging technologies were shown in relation to EBV candidates such as species distribution, net primary productivity, and habitat structure. We also developed a framework based on the primary biodiversity attributes, which indicated the potential of integration between monitoring approaches. In situ sensors are suitable to help measure biodiversity composition, while approaches based on remote sensing are powerful for addressing structural and functional biodiversity attributes. We conclude that, synergy between the recent biodiversity monitoring approaches is important and possible. However, testing the suitability of monitoring methods across scales, integrating heterogeneous monitoring technologies, setting up metadata standards, and making interpolation and/or extrapolation from observation at different scales is still required to design a robust biodiversity monitoring system that can contribute to effective conservation measures.},

  abstract = {Stochastic versions of Gompertz, Ricker, and various other dynamics models play a fundamental role in quantifying strength of density dependence and studying long-term dynamics of wildlife populations. These models are frequently estimated using time series of abundance estimates that are inevitably subject to observation error and missing data. This issue can be addressed with a state-space modeling framework that jointly estimates the observed data model and the underlying stochastic population dynamics (SPD) model. In cases where abundance data are from multiple locations with a smaller spatial resolution (e.g., from mark-recapture and distance sampling studies), models are conventionally fitted to spatially pooled estimates of yearly abundances. Here, we demonstrate that a spatial version of SPD models can be directly estimated from short time series of spatially referenced distance sampling data in a unified hierarchical state-space modeling framework that also allows for spatial variance (covariance) in population growth. We also show that a full range of likelihood based inference, including estimability diagnostics and model-selection, is feasible in this class of models using a data cloning algorithm. We further show through simulation experiments that the hierarchical state--space framework introduced herein efficiently captures the underlying dynamical parameters and spatial abundance distribution. We apply our methodology by analyzing a time series of line-transect distance sampling data for fin whales (Balaenoptera physalus) off the U.S. west coast. Although there were only seven surveys conducted during the study time frame, 1991-2014, our analysis detected presence of strong density regulation and provided reliable estimates of fin whale densities. In summary, we show that the integrative framework developed herein allows ecologists to better infer key population characteristics such as presence of density regulation and spatial variability in a population's intrinsic growth potential.},

Most gibbons are threatened due to deforestation. We studied the western hoolock gibbon (Hoolock hoolock) in Bangladesh to determine population size and extent of suitable habitat. We used distance sampling to estimate density across 22 sites in northeastern and southeastern Bangladesh. We used Maxent modeling to determine areas of highly suitable habitat throughout Bangladesh. Density was estimated to be 0.39 \& PLUSMN; 0.09groups/km(2), and the total estimated population was 468.96 \& PLUSMN; 45.56 individuals in 135.31 \& PLUSMN; 2.23 groups. The Maxent model accurately predicted gibbon distribution. Vegetation cover, isothermality, annual precipitation, elevation and mean temperature of the warmest quarter influenced distribution. Two areas in the northeast and two areas in the southeast have high potential for gibbon conservation in Bangladesh. We also found significantly more gibbons in areas that had some level of official protection. Thus, we suggest careful evaluation, comprehensive surveys and restoration of habitats identified as suitable for gibbons. We recommend bringing specific sites in the northeastern and southeastern regions under protection to secure habitat for remaining gibbon populations.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Although much research has been done to improve the precision of nest-surveys, trade-offs between data-reliability and research-efficiency have not been solved. In this study, we used different approaches to assess the landscape-scale distribution patterns of great apes. We conducted a conventional nest survey and a camera-trap survey concurrently, and checked the consistency of the estimates. We divided the study area (ca. 500km(2)), containing various types of vegetation and topography, into thirty 16-km(2) grids (4kmx4km) and performed both methods along 2-km transects centered in each grid. We determined the nest creator species according to the definitions by Tutin \& Fernandez [Tutin \& Fernandez, 1984, Am J Primatol 6:313-336] and estimated nest-site densities of each species by using the conventional distance-sampling approach. We calculated the mean capture rate of 3 camera traps left for 3 months at each grid as the abundance index. Our analyses showed that both methods provided roughly consistent results for the distribution patterns of the species; chimpanzee groups (parties) were more abundant in the montane forest, and gorilla groups were relatively homogeneously distributed across vegetation types. The line-transect survey also showed that the number of nests per nest site did not vary among vegetation types for either species. These spatial patterns seemed to reflect the ecological and sociological features of each species. Although the consistent results may be largely dependent on site-specific conditions (e.g., high density of each species, distinct distribution pattern between the two species), conventional nest-surveys and a subsequent check of their consistency with independent estimates may be a reasonable approach to obtain certain information on the species distribution patterns. Further analytical improvement is necessary for camera-traps to be considered a stand-alone method. Am. J. Primatol. 75:1220-1230, 2013. (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

  abstract = {Camera traps are a powerful tool for wildlife surveys. However, camera traps may not always detect animals passing in front. This constraint may create a substantial bias in estimating critical parameters such as the density of unmarked populations. We proposed the 'double-observer approach' with camera traps to counter the constraint, which involves setting up a paired camera trap at a station and correcting imperfect detection with a reformulated hierarchical capture-recapture model for stratified populations. We performed simulations to evaluate this approach's reliability and determine how to obtain desirable data for this approach. We then applied it to 12 mammals in Japan and Cameroon. The results showed that the model assuming a beta-binomial distribution as detection processes could correct imperfect detection as long as paired camera traps detect animals nearly independently (Correlation coefficient\,≤\,0.2). Camera traps should be installed to monitor a predefined small focal area from different directions to satisfy this requirement. The field surveys showed that camera trap could miss animals by 3–40\%, suggesting that current density estimation models relying on perfect detection may underestimate animal density by the same order of magnitude. We hope that our approach will be incorporated into existing density estimation models to improve their accuracy.},

  abstract = {1. Efficient and reliable methods for estimating animal density are essential to wildlife conservation and management. Camera trapping is an increasingly popular tool in this area of wildlife research, with further potential arising from technological improvements, such as video-recording functions that allow for behavioural observation of animals. This information may be useful in the estimation of animal density, even without individual recognition. Although several models applicable to species lacking individual markings (i.e. unmarked populations) have been developed, a methodology incorporating behavioural information from videos has not yet been established. 2. We developed a likelihood-based model: the random encounter and staying time (REST) model. It is an extension of the random encounter model by Rowcliffe et al. (J Appl Ecol 45: 1228, 2008). The REST model describes the relationship among staying time, trapping rate, and density, which is estimable using a frequentist or Bayesian approach. We tested the reliability and feasibility of the REST model using Monte Carlo simulations. We also applied the approach in the African rainforest and compared the results with those of a line-transect survey. 3. The simulations showed that the REST model provided unbiased estimates of animal density. Even when animal movement speeds varied among individuals, and when animals travelled in pairs, the model provided unbiased density estimates. However, the REST model was vulnerable to unsynchronized activity patterns among individuals. Moreover, it is necessary to use a camera model with a fast and reliable infrared sensor and to set the camera trap's parameters appropriately (i.e. video length, delay period). The field survey showed that the staying time of two ungulate species in the African rainforest exhibited good fit with a temporal parametric distribution, and the REST model provided density estimates consistent with those of a line-transect survey. 4. Synthesis and applications. The random encounter and staying time model provides better efficiency and higher feasibility than the random encounter model in estimating animal density without individual recognition. Careful application of the random encounter and staying time model provides the potential to estimate density of many ground-dwelling vertebrates lacking individually recognizable markings, and thus should be an effective method for population monitoring.},

We compared density estimates derived from these techniques to those derived from labour-intensive capture-recapture techniques. Distance sampling and capture-recapture techniques produced comparable density estimates at medium and low hare densities. Density estimates derived from distance sampling were higher than those derived from capture-recapture in high-density hare populations. Both distance sampling and capture-recapture techniques gave wide confidence intervals at high hare density. Histograms of perpendicular sighting distances showed that a large proportion of hares were seen on or close to the transect line and that there was a rapid fall off in detection rates with distance. This finding indicated that hare behaviour may lead to problematic survey design and may reduce the precision of density estimates. The collection of accurate distance sampling data was particularly problematic when hare density was high. In contrast, in low-density hare populations, considerable sampling effort was required to obtain sufficient sightings of hares to reliably estimate density. Dung plots provided a relative index of abundance that successfully ranked populations of mountain hares in order of increasing density as determined by distance sampling and capture-recapture techniques. With careful study design, distance sampling provides a good compromise between accuracy, precision and effort in estimating the density of mountain hares. The use of dung plots is a rapid alternative when only estimates of relative abundance are required.},

  abstract = {Methods Line transect data collected by volunteers in 1998 from 2287 1-km squares across the UK were analysed using distance sampling methods to calculate habitat-specific density and abundance estimates. For each species, the habitat-specific decline in detectability with distance from a transect line was modelled and applied at a regional level to incorporate variation in sampling intensity in different areas of the country. Results National population and density estimates calculated here were at a magnitude expected for at least seven species in this study. However, national population size estimates were higher than expected for Starling Sturnus vulgaris, House Sparrow Passer domesticus, Blackbird Turdus merula, Greenfinch Carduelis chloris, Jackdaw Corvus monedula, Whitethroat Sylvia communis, Woodpigeon Columba palumbus and Linnet Carduelis cannabina and lower than expected for Skylark Alauda arvensis, Dunnock Prunella modularis, Song Thrush Turdus philomelos and Corn Bunting Miliaria calandra. These differences are likely to be related to differences in sampling design and survey methods. For example, Starling, House Sparrow, Blackbird, Jackdaw, Greenfinch and Wood Pigeon, which have considerable populations in urban areas, were undoubtedly underestimated by the Common Birds Census (CBC). The counts of species that flock during the breeding season, or are not strongly territorial (e.g. Linnet, Jackdaw and Wood Pigeon) could be biased if detectability is strongly related to flock size. National population estimates of Skylark and Corn Bunting are lower than those based on CBC, but higher, or similar, to targeted national surveys of these species. Possible reasons for the differences between these estimates are considered. Conclusions This study highlights the strength of the BBS over previous data sources in producing national estimates of density and abundance at the habitat and national level. More research on the sex ratio and status of birds counted during surveys, and on the reliability of the detectability functions derived from distance sampling is needed to improve the interpretation of population estimates derived from BBS data.},

  abstract = {[1. Population estimates are of fundamental importance for setting conservation priorities and for numerous aspects of conservation biology. 2. Distance sampling, which takes undetected individuals into account, is one of the most widely used methods for generating population estimates. We use this method to generate estimates of the national population size for all common and widespread non-marine breeding birds in the UK using Breeding Bird Survey data. 3. There is a strong positive relationship between our distance-sampled estimates and estimates generated using other methods. This implies that most methods get the broad picture right, even if one of them is less precise for individual species. 4. For some species, detectability may vary sufficiently between males and females to generate biases in population size estimates if these differences are not taken into account. We found a slight tendency for population estimates from distance sampling to be lower than existing estimates for species with marked sex biases in detectability. This may be a wider problem than is currently acknowledged in distance sampling. 5. Distance sampling provides a method for estimating total population size. Other bird population survey methods, such as intensive territory mapping, aim to count the number of breeding pairs, and thus exclude non-breeding individuals. Not surprisingly, we found that distance-sampled estimates tended to be higher for species with a large proportion of non-breeders. Both approaches are valid, but when calculating, reporting and using population estimates attention needs to be paid to which variable is of most interest. 6. The new estimates that we present are significantly larger than existing ones for species whose preferred habitat types were not previously well surveyed. This highlights the importance of sampling across all main habitat types. 7. Synthesis and applications. This study reviews alternative methods used for producing estimates of population size for common and widespread breeding birds in the UK. We assess a number of factors affecting population estimates generated by distance sampling.]},

Deriving rich coastal morphology and shore zone classification from LIDAR terrain models. Comprehensive mapping of shore-zone morphology supports evaluation of shore habitat, monitoring of environmental hazards, and characterization of the transfer of nutrients between marine and terrestrial environments. This article shows how rich shore-zone morphological metrics can be derived from LIDAR terrain models and evaluates the application of LIDAR to classify shore-zone substrates. The utility of LIDAR methods was tested in comparison with the current best-practice method of photo interpretation (i.e. the BC ShoreZone system) on Calvert Island, British Columbia, Canada. Wider applications are considered. Indicators of shore-zone morphology (i.e. slope, width, roughness, backshore elevation) were calculated from LIDAR terrain models for regularly spaced transects perpendicular to the coastline. A combination of boosted regression-tree modeling and direct-rule application was used to classify the shore-zone morphology according to the British Columbia (BC) ShoreZone system. Classification accuracy was assessed against existing ShoreZone classification data. Shore-zone substrate was classified from LIDAR-derived morphometric indicators with 90\% accuracy (five classes). A full classification, which combined substrate with shore width and slope, results in lower correspondence (40\%; 25 classes) when compared with ShoreZone classes. Differences can likely be attributed, in part, to variation in spatial resolution of elevation-based methods and photo interpretation. It is concluded that LIDAR data can be used to support characterization of shore-zone morphology. Differences in processing and interpretation cause a low direct correspondence with the current image-based classification system, but LIDAR has the advantage of higher resolution, rich terrain information, speed, and an objective and repeatable method for monitoring future change in coastal environments.},

  abstract = {Site productivity, as affected by soil nutrients and available moisture is often characterized using an edatopic grid. A challenge for forest ecologists and managers working across large areas and in complex landscapes is the need to identify spatially different ecological environments that follow an edatopic classification. Recent advances in remote sensing offer some potential approaches for mapping ecological environments and landscape conditions. It is now feasible to compile long temporal image sequences using Landsat imagery for reconstruction of forest stands and derivation of long term indices of landscape productivity; and the increasing proliferation of airborne laser scanning (ALS) technology also allows for the acquisition of detailed information on topographic elevation and vegetation structure with sub-meter accuracy. In a large area of boreal mixedwood forest in northwestern Alberta, Canada, we examined the utility of using Landsat-derived vegetation greenness (indicating productivity), and ALS-derived cartographic depth-to-water (indicating moisture), to determine forest cover type and vegetation responses following variable retention harvesting. Our results demonstrate that both long-term image sequences from Landsat and ALS-derived topography and vegetation structure act as proxies for edatopic grid components, and are well-suited to differentiating forest cover types. Deciduous-dominated, deciduousdominated with conifer understory, mixed, and conifer-dominated forests were generally distributed (in order) across a gradient of increasing moisture and decreasing greenness. Landscape greenness was the strongest predictor of vegetation regrowth after disturbance, followed by depth to water and other terrain factors, such as elevation and slope. New advances in, and complementary use of, different remotely sensed information provides a better understanding of both the landscape-scale distribution of forest cover types and patterns of vegetation regrowth following disturbance.},

  abstract = {Fire influences the distribution of fauna in terrestrial biomes throughout the world. Use of fire to achieve a mosaic of vegetation in different stages of succession after burning (i.e., patch-mosaic burning) is a dominant conservation practice in many regions. Despite this, knowledge of how the spatial attributes of vegetation mosaics created by fire affect fauna is extremely scarce, and it is unclear what kind of mosaic land managers should aim to achieve. We selected 28 landscapes (each 12.6 km2) that varied in the spatial extent and diversity of vegetation succession after fire in a 104,000 km2 area in the semiarid region of southeastern Australia. We surveyed for reptiles at 280 sites nested within the 28 landscapes. The landscape-level occurrence of 9 of the 22 species modeled was associated with the spatial extent of vegetation age classes created by fire. Biogeographic context and the extent of a vegetation type influenced 7 and 4 species, respectively. No species were associated with the diversity of vegetation ages within a landscape. Negative relations between reptile occurrence and both extent of recently burned vegetation (≤10 years postfire, n = 6) and long unburned vegetation ({$>$}35 years postfire, n = 4) suggested that a coarse-grained mosaic of areas (e.g. {$>$}1000 ha) of midsuccessional vegetation (11–35 years postfire) may support the fire-sensitive reptile species we modeled. This age class coincides with a peak in spinifex cover, a keystone structure for reptiles in semiarid and arid Australia. Maintaining over the long term a coarse-grained mosaic of large areas of midsuccessional vegetation in mallee ecosystems will need to be balanced against the short-term negative effects of large fires on many reptile species and a documented preference by species from other taxonomic groups, particularly birds, for older vegetation.},

For most wildlife species, multiple abundance estimation methods are available and the choice of method should depend on cost and efficacy. We field-tested the cost and efficacy of line transect, total count, sample count. and double observer methods for estimating abundance of gopher tortoise (Gopherus polyphemus) burrows in two habitats that differed in vegetation density (sparse and dense) at the Ordway-Swisher Biological Station in north-central Florida. In the dense vegetation stratum, density of burrows estimated using the line transect method (8.58 +/- 0.94 burrows ha(-1)) was lower than that obtained from the total count method (11.33 burrows ha(-1)). In the sparse vegetation stratum, estimated burrow density using the line transect method (11.32 +/- 1.19 burrows ha(-1)) was closer to the burrow density obtained from the total count method (13.00 burrows ha(-1)). Density of burrows estimated using the double observer method was identical to that obtained from the total count method in dense vegetation stratum, but slightly greater than that obtained from the total count method in sparse vegetation stratum. Density of burrows estimated using the sample count method varied widely depending on the proportion of plots sampled. The cost of sampling as well as estimates of burrow density varied with habitat type. The line transect method was the least costly of the methods, and we were able to sample a larger effective area with the same effort. Using burrow cameras and patch occupancy modeling approach, we also estimated the probability of burrow occupancy by gopher tortoises (active: 0.50 +/- 0.09; inactive: 0.04 +/- 0.04), and used these values to estimate abundance of gopher tortoises. Using estimates of burrow abundance based on the line transect method, density of gopher tortoises was 2.75 +/- 0.74 ha(-1) in the sparse vegetation stratum. We recommend that gopher tortoise monitoring programs use rigorous methods for estimating burrow abundance (e.g., line transect methods) and the probability of burrow occupancy by gopher tortoises (e.g., patch occupancy modeling approach).},

  abstract = {The continued degradation of forest habitats and isolation of fragmented populations means that the conservation of endemic marmosets in the Brazilian Atlantic forest depends on human interventions including legal protection. Population monitoring is required to ensure effective management and appropriate allocation of conservation resources; however, deriving estimates of population metrics such as density within heterogeneous environments is challenging. We aimed to quantify the population density and spatial distribution of buffy-tufted-ear marmosets (Callithrix aurita) in the northern region of Serra-do-Mar State Park. We incorporated habitat suitability as quantified by a niche modeling algorithm (MAXENT) to refine density estimates obtained via distance methods. We used 6 environmental predictors to model the distribution of Callithrix aurita and used the resulting MAXENT niche model to identify environmental conditions that represent suitable habitat for this species. We used 877.7 km of line transect surveys and distance methods to derive estimates of 2.19 groups or 7.55 individuals/km2 from direct observations (n = 40), providing an overall population estimate of 1892 (95\% CI = 1155–3068) individuals in 250.7 km2 of Atlantic forest. Our refined density estimate, obtained by combining distance methods and a niche model, yielded a result of 1386 individuals. Suitable habitat was not uniformly distributed across the study area and was most strongly associated with altitude and the type of vegetation cover. We provide a review of previous surveys and find this is the largest known population of Callithrix aurita. Our refinement of density estimates provides a simple and informative addition to the primatologist’s toolbox.},

By generating relative-abundance indices with point-count methods and density with point-transect sampling methods, we examined whether the assumptions underlying each method were met during field surveys for four bird species (Brown-headed Cowbird [Molothrus ater], Bullock's Oriole [Icterus bullockii], Warbling Vireo [Vireo gilvus], and Yellow Warbler [Dendroica petechia]). Point-count methods failed to reasonably meet the fundamental assumption of constant proportionality, with estimated detectability varying 3- to 5-fold despite the use of widely accepted and well-standardized methods. Population trends based on relative abundance were subsequently unstable, often varying in both magnitude and direction with the survey plot radius used (25 In, 50 In, or unlimited distance). Distance-sampling methods appeared to meet critical assumptions, were robust to assumption violations, allowed methodological self-assessment, and were demonstrably efficient in a large-scale, multispecies survey setting. Our data show surveys of birds without estimations of detectability are likely biased because the assumption of constant proportionality is violated to a degree that precludes strict inference and may confound trend analyses.

  abstract = {Enlightened forest management requires reliable information on the status and condition of each forest - interpreted from a broad context - and of change in forest conditions over time. The process of forest planning must begin with a clear statement of goals, from which detailed objectives and management plans follow. Goals and objectives for forest management should reflect the conservation value of a forest relative to other forests of the same general type. This paper reviews some recent assessments (with emphasis on North America), presents a framework for forest assessment and monitoring, and suggests some indicators of biodiversity in forests. Among the broad assessments of forest status and conservation value are a global `forest frontiers' assessment by the World Resources Institute, gap analysis projects that assess the level of representation of forests and other communities in protected areas, and ecoregion-based conservation assessments conducted by the World Wildlife Fund. Also important is information on change in forest area and condition over time. Among the common changes in forests over the past two centuries are loss of old forests, simplification of forest structure, decreasing size of forest patches, increasing isolation of patches, disruption of natural fire regimes, and increased road building, all of which have had negative effects on native biodiversity. These trends can be reversed, or at least slowed, through better management. Progress toward forest recovery can be measured through the use of ecological indicators that correspond to the specific conditions and trends of concern. Although there is a wealth of indicators to choose from, most have been poorly tested and require rigorous validation in order to be interpreted with confidence. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

  abstract = {Abstract:  Biodiversity is presently a minor consideration in environmental policy. It has been regarded as too broad and vague a concept to be applied to real-world regulatory and management problems. This problem can be corrected if biodiversity is recognized as an end in itself, and if measurable indicators can be selected to assess the status of biodiversity over time. Biodiversity, as presently understood, encompasses multiple levels of biological organization. In this paper, I expand the three primary attributes of biodiversity recognized by Jerry Franklin — composition, structure, and function—into a nested hierarchy that incorporates elements of each attribute at four levels of organization: regional landscape, community-ecosystem, population-species, and genetic. Indicators of each attribute in terrestrial ecosystems, at the four levels of organization, are identified for environmental monitoring purposes. Projects to monitor biodiversity will benefit from a direct linkage to long-term ecological research and a commitment to test hypotheses relevant to biodiversity conservation. A general guideline is to proceed from the top down, beginning with a coarse-scale inventory of landscape pattern, vegetation, habitat structure, and species distributions, then overlaying data on stress levels to identify biologically significant areas at high risk of impoverishment. Intensive research and monitoring can be directed to high-risk ecosystems and elements of biodiversity, while less intensive monitoring is directed to the total landscape (or samples thereof). In any monitoring program, particular attention should be paid to specifying the questions that monitoring is intended to answer and validating the relationships between indicators and the components of biodiversity they represent.},

Yet, rigorous longitudinal monitoring within PAs is rare. In Southeast Asia (SEA), there is a paucity of long-term wildlife monitoring within PAs, and many threatened species lack population estimates from anywhere in their range, making global assessments difficult. Here, we present new abundance estimates and population trends for 11 species between 2010 and 2020, and spatial distributions for 7 species, based on long-term line transect distance sampling surveys in Keo Seima Wildlife Sanctuary in Cambodia. These represent the first robust population estimates for four threatened species from anywhere in their range and are among the first long-term wildlife population trend analyses from the entire SEA region. Our study revealed that arboreal primates and green peafowl (Pavo muticus) generally had either stable or increasing population trends, whereas ungulates and semiarboreal primates generally had declining trends. These results suggest that ground-based threats, such as snares and domestic dogs, are having serious negative effects on terrestrial species. These findings have important conservation implications for PAs across SEA that face similar threats yet lack reliable monitoring data.},

  abstract = {Bushmeat management policies are often developed outside the communities in which they are to be implemented. These policies are also routinely designed to be applied uniformly across communities with little regard for variation in social or ecological conditions. We used fuzzy-logic cognitive mapping, a form of participatory modeling, to compare the assumptions driving externally generated bushmeat management policies with perceptions of bushmeat trade dynamics collected from local community members who admitted to being recently engaged in bushmeat trading (e.g., hunters, sellers, consumers). Data were collected during 9 workshops in 4 Tanzanian villages bordering Serengeti National Park. Specifically, we evaluated 9 community-generated models for the presence of the central factors that comprise and drive the bushmeat trade and whether or not models included the same core concepts, relationships, and logical chains of reasoning on which bushmeat conservation policies are commonly based. Across local communities, there was agreement about the most central factors important to understanding the bushmeat trade (e.g., animal recruitment, low income, and scarcity of food crops). These matched policy assumptions. However, the factors perceived to drive social-ecological bushmeat trade dynamics were more diverse and varied considerably across communities (e.g., presence or absence of collaborative law enforcement, increasing human population, market demand, cultural preference). Sensitive conservation issues, such as the bushmeat trade, that require cooperation between communities and outside conservation organizations can benefit from participatory modeling approaches that make local-scale dynamics and conservation policy assumptions explicit. Further, communities' and conservation organizations' perceptions need to be aligned. This can improve success by allowing context appropriate policies to be developed, monitored, and appropriately adapted as new evidence is generated.},

  abstract = {In the last few years there has been a marked growth of interest in the recent history of climate. The evidence of secular variations in climatic parameters during the last few centuries has implications for ecologists studying forests containing long-lived species. Such species record aspects of past climate in their annual growth-rings and in their population structures. The study of annual growth rings in Australian trees is still in its infancy. The concepts and techniques of dendrochronology and its sub-fields dendroecology and dendroclimatology are outlined. A species by species account of dendrochronological studies employing Australian trees is presented. As most of the results are unpublished, the treatment is selective and intended to illustrate the potential of, or progress with, a particular tree species. The greatest potential for dendrochronology in Australia lies with the endemic Tasmanian conifers in the genera Athrotaxis, Dacrydium and Phyllocladus. Not only do these contain very long lived individuals (e.g. {$>$}2000yr, Dacrydium frankliniU but also they have the most suitable ring characteristics. Chronologies of about 1000 y rand 780 yr are being prepared for A. cupressoides and Phyllocladus aspleniifolius respectively. There is good regional cross-dating within species, and to a lesser extent between species, giving promise of a detailed reconstruction of past climate for Tasmania.},

  abstract = {Effective management and conservation of wildlife populations require reliable estimates of population size, which can be difficult and costly to obtain. We evaluated how precision in estimates of herd size and abundance varies with sample size and strip width using two field surveys and bootstrap resampling of the field data. We also examined precision under distance sampling and evaluated the cost-effectiveness of both survey techniques. Precision in estimates of abundance increased with increasing sample size and varied with strip width independently of sample size. The hazard rate key function was best for five species in two surveys with contrasting visibility conditions. Precision in density was more sensitive to the number of herds sighted than to variation in herd size and effective strip width for distance sampling. Strip counts produced lower abundance estimates but higher precision than distance sampling. We estimated that distance sampling would cost about US\$3.1 km(-1) of transect. Strip counts deserve serious consideration for surveys of species that occur at high densities and form large, loose agglomerations but distance methods are suitable for species occurring at moderate to low densities in areas where visibility varies substantially. Distance sampling may thus need to be supplemented by strip counts to efficiently estimate densities of rare, abundant and highly clustered multi-species assemblages of African savanna mammals. In small areas, it may often prove necessary to conduct several surveys to obtain adequate sample sizes for distance models.},

  abstract = {Management often bases decisions on estimates of animal density and population size. Aerial sampling is expensive whilst current ground methods, noticeably Distance sampling, assume a single detection function for each habitat and that visibility in a given habitat type declines in a smooth, increasing manner with distance from the observer. If the visibility within a habitat varies widely or is suddenly cut off, as amongst abrupt topography, these assumptions are invalidated. We present an affordable, accessible and accurate method for conducting repeated annual censuses on large herbivores in such terrain. We used a GIS habitat-based approach. Monthly, over a two year period, we conducted repeated road transects in Ithala Game Reserve, South Africa, using GPS to record the geographic position of each sighting. These records (n=8742) were then imported into a GIS and overlaid onto an existing habitat-type GIS layer. With the sampled area thus defined as an irregular polygon in the GIS encompassing all records, we calculated densities of each herbivore species by habitat type and extrapolated total population size estimates. Estimates of maximum population size for wildebeest and zebra correlated (+/- 15\%) with management's estimates based on aerial surveys, walked transects and experience. White rhino are individually counted in the reserve and our estimates (year 1: 52; year 2: 57) matched these known numbers (year 1: 50; year 2: 53). Our method also yielded realistic numbers for impala, but unrealistic numbers for kudu and warthog. Our GIS-based census technique produced realistic maximum population estimates for abundant grazing and mixed-feeder mesoherbivores and for scarce, but highly visible, megaherbivores, but not for cryptic species. With the increasing availability of GIS data, the technique is recommended to those working in abrupt terrain frustrated by the inability of current ground census techniques, principally Distance sampling, to produce realistic population estimates.},

Quantitative estimates of gazelle numbers are essential for understanding the causes of changes in the population, and thus devising conservation strategies to assure its long-term viability. Observed herds ranged in size from 1-4,000; among surveys, median herd sizes varied from 14-42. Density estimates varied from 10.7 gazelles km(-2) in spring to 11.5 gazelles km(-2) in autumn, with total population estimates of 803,820 (483,790-1,330,100 95\%, confidence interval) and 870,625 (499,432-1,491,278 95\% confidence interval), respectively. Confidence limits were wide, and to obtain a coefficient of variation of 20\%, transect lengths would need to be extended three- to four-fold.

  abstract = {Systematic, effective monitoring of animal population parameters underpins successful conservation strategy and wildlife management, but it is often neglected in many regions, including much of the Mediterranean Sea. Nonetheless, a series of systematic multispecies aerial surveys was carried out in the seas around Italy to gather important baseline information on cetacean occurrence, distribution and abundance. The monitored areas included the Pelagos Sanctuary, the Tyrrhenian Sea, portions of the Seas of Corsica and Sardinia, the Ionian Seas as well as the Gulf of Taranto. Overall, approximately 48,000 km were flown in either spring, summer and winter between 2009-2014, covering an area of 444,621 km(2). The most commonly observed species were the striped dolphin and the fin whale, with 975 and 83 recorded sightings, respectively. Other sighted cetacean species were the common bottlenose dolphin, the Risso's dolphin, the sperm whale, the pilot whale and the Cuvier's beaked whale. Uncorrected model-and design-based estimates of density and abundance for striped dolphins and fin whales were produced, resulting in a best estimate (model-based) of around 95,000 striped dolphins (CV=11.6\%; 95\% CI=92,900-120,300) occurring in the Pelagos Sanctuary, Central Tyrrhenian and Western Seas of Corsica and Sardinia combined area in summer 2010. Estimates were also obtained for each individual study region and year. An initial attempt to estimate perception bias for striped dolphins is also provided. The preferred summer 2010 uncorrected best estimate (design-based) for the same areas for fin whales was around 665 (CV=33.1\%; 95\% CI=350-1260). Estimates are also provided for the individual study regions and years. The results represent baseline data to develop efficient, long-term, systematic monitoring programmes, essential to evaluate trends, as required by a number of national and international frameworks, and stress the need to ensure that surveys are undertaken regularly and at a sufficient spatial scale. The management implications of the results are discussed also in light of a possible decline of fin whales abundance over the period from the mid-1990s to the present.

  abstract = {Statistical models for estimating absolute densities of field populations of animals have been widely used over the last century in both scientific studies and wildlife management programs. To date, two general classes of density estimation models have been developed: models that use data sets from capture-recapture or removal sampling techniques (often derived from trapping grids) from which separate estimates of population size ((N) over cap) and effective sampling area ((A) over cap) are used to calculate density ((D) over cap = (N) over cap/(A) over cap); and models applicable to sampling regimes using distance-sampling theory (typically transect lines or trapping webs) to estimate detection functions and densities directly from the distance data. However, few studies have evaluated these respective models for accuracy, precision. and bias on known field populations. and no studies have been conducted that compare the two approaches under controlled field conditions. In this study, we evaluated both classes of density estimators on known densities of enclosed rodent populations. Test data sets (n = 11) were developed using nine rodent species from capture-recapture live-trapping on both trapping grids and trapping webs in four replicate 4.2-ha enclosures on the Sevilleta National Wildlife Refuge in central New Mexico, USA. Additional "saturation" trapping efforts resulted in an enumeration of the rodent populations in each enclosure, allowing the computation of true densities. Density estimates ((D) over cap) were calculated using program CAPTURE for the grid data sets and program DISTANCE for the web data sets, and these results were compared to the known true densities (D) to evaluate each model's relative mean square error, accuracy, precision, and bias. In addition, we evaluated a variety of approaches to each data set's analysis by having a group of independent expert analysts calculate their best density estimates without a priori knowledge of the true densities this "blind" test allowed us to evaluate the influence of expertise and experience in calculating density estimates in comparison to simply using default values in programs CAPTURE and DISTANCE. While the rodent sample sizes were considerably smaller than the recommended minimum for good model results, we found that several models performed well empirically. including the web-based uniform and half-normal models in program DISTANCE, and the grid-based models M-b and M-bh in program CAPTURE (with A adjusted by species-specific full mean maximum distance moved (MMDM) values). These models produced accurate (D) over cap values (with 95\% confidence intervals that included the true D values) and exhibited acceptable bias but poor precision. However. in linear regression analyses comparing each model's (D) over cap values to the true D values over the range of observed test densities, only the web-based uniform model exhibited a regression slope near 1.0; all other models showed substantial slope deviations. indicating biased estimates at higher or lower density values. In addition, the grid-based (D) over cap analyses using full MMDM values for (W) over cap area adjustments required a number of theoretical assumptions of uncertain validity, and we therefore viewed their empirical successes with caution. Finally, density estimates from the independent analysts were highly variable, but estimates from web-based approaches had smaller mean square errors and better achieved confidence-interval coverage of D than did grid-based approaches. Our results support the contention that web-based approaches for density estimation of small-mammal populations are both theoretically and empirically superior to grid-based approaches, even when sample size is far less than often recommended. In view of the increasing need for standardized environmental measures for comparisons among ecosystems and through time, analytical models based on distance sampling appear to offer accurate density estimation approaches for research studies involving small-mammal abundances.},

  abstract = {Conservation management of wildlife species should be underpinned by knowledge of their distribution and abundance, as well as impacts of human activities on their populations and habitats. Common dolphins (Delphinus delphis) are subject to incidental capture in a range of Australia’s commercial fisheries including gill netting, purse seining and mid-water trawling. The impact these fishery interactions have on common dolphin populations is uncertain, as estimates of abundance are lacking, particularly for the segments of the populations at risk of bycatch and in greater need of protection. Here we used double-observer platform aerial surveys and mark-recapture distance sampling methods to estimate the abundance of common dolphins in 2011 over an area of 42,438 km2 in central South Australia, where incidental mortality of common dolphins due to fisheries bycatch is the highest. We also used the potential biological removal (PBR) method to estimate sustainable levels of human-caused mortality for this segment of the population. The estimated abundance of common dolphins was 21,733 (CV = 0.25; 95\% CI = 13,809–34,203) in austral summer/autumn and 26,504 in winter/spring (CV = 0.19; 95\% CI = 19,488–36,046). Annual PBR estimates, assuming a conservative maximum population growth rate of Rmax = 0.02 and a recovery factor of Fr = 0.5 for species of unknown conservation status, ranged from 189 (summer/autumn) to 239 dolphins (winter/spring), and from 378 (summer/autumn) to 478 dolphins (winter/spring) with an Rmax = 0.04. Our results indicate that common dolphins are an abundant dolphin species in waters over the central South Australian continental shelf (up to 100 m deep). Based on the 2011 abundance estimates of this species, the highest estimated bycatch of common dolphins (423 mortalities in 2004/05) in the southern Australian region exceeded the precautionary PBR estimates for this population segment. Recent bycatch levels appear to be below PBR estimates, but low observer coverage and underreporting of dolphin mortalities by fishers means that estimates of dolphin bycatch rates are not robust. The effects of cumulative human impacts on common dolphins are not well understood, and thus we recommend a precautionary management approach to manage common dolphin bycatch based on local abundance estimates.},

  abstract = {Monitoring the distribution and abundance of hunted wildlife is critical to achieving sustainable resource use, yet adequate data are sparse for most tropical regions. Conventional methods for monitoring hunted forest-vertebrate species require intensive in situ survey effort, which severely constrains spatial and temporal replication. Integrating local ecological knowledge (LEK) into monitoring and management is appealing because it can be cost-effective, enhance community participation, and provide novel insights into sustainable resource use. We develop a technique to monitor population depletion of hunted forest wildlife in the Brazilian Amazon, based on the local ecological knowledge of rural hunters. We performed rapid interview surveys to estimate the landscape-scale depletion of ten large-bodied vertebrate species around 161 Amazonian riverine settlements. We assessed the explanatory and predictive power of settlement and landscape characteristics and were able to develop robust estimates of local faunal depletion. By identifying species-specific drivers of depletion and using secondary data on human population density, land form, and physical accessibility, we then estimated landscape-and regional-scale depletion. White-lipped peccary (Tayassu pecari), for example, were estimated to be absent from 17\% of their putative range in Brazil's largest state (Amazonas), despite 98\% of the original forest cover remaining intact. We found evidence that bushmeat consumption in small urban centers has far-reaching impacts on some forest species, including severe depletion well over 100 km from urban centers. We conclude that LEK-based approaches require further field validation, but have significant potential for community-based participatory monitoring as well as cost-effective, large-scale monitoring of threatened forest species.},

  abstract = {Estimating population abundance for territorial species is challenging because individuals often differ in behavior (e.g., transience, multiterritoriality), and thus in detectability. How well prevailing methods detect and quantify individuals using multiple strategies is rarely addressed. In our effort to efficiently quantify avian abundance and transience among diverse nonbreeding habitats, we combined 'unmarked' (distance sampling) with traditional 'marked' (territory mapping) survey methods using a migratory passerine, the American Redstart (Setophaga ruticilla), wintering in 3 habitats in Jamaica from 2010 to 2012. We predicted that the 'unmarked' survey method would detect not only all known (marked) territorial individuals, but also individuals that were transient or nonterritorial in the same habitats. Comparisons of abundance estimates generated by our best distance sampling (unmarked) model with territory mapping data identified high proportions of transient individuals (up to 50\%) in 2 habitats, coastal dry scrub and mangrove, and virtually none in the third habitat, higher-elevation wet limestone forest. Documenting so many nonterritorial individuals, disproportionately weighted toward females and yearlings, in some habitat-year combinations prompts questions of what conditions favor transience and what role these individuals play in population processes. Our results illustrate how unmarked and marked survey methods can be used jointly to establish the number and identity of transients from neighboring areas. The unmarked survey method was sufficient for estimating population size among different habitats, but marked survey methods were necessary to identify and quantify transient individuals. Combined, these methods provide a powerful tool for assessing the range and variation of space-use strategies deployed by nonbreeding individuals.},

  abstract = {Despite being a widespread and important game species in Europe, scientifically reliable, easy applicable and cost effective methods for monitoring abundance of roe deer Capreolus capreolus populations do not yet exist. The currently recommended kilometric index (AI-p) captures temporal variation in the relative abundance of populations; however, because this index is carried out on foot, it is demanding in terms of sampling effort and difficult to apply at spatial scales of several hundred km(2) typical of deer management units. Here, we propose and test a modified version of the kilometric index by using a vehicle to carry out transects over large areas (AI-v). To validate this abundance index, we compared variation in population abundance estimated with AI-p and AI-v with capture-mark-recapture (CMR) estimates of population density in a roe deer population, Chize (France), monitored for 24 years (including eight years when both indices were collected). We found no detectable effect of conditions of observation (temperature and precipitation) on either AI-p or AI-v. AI-p and AI-v were both positively and linearly related (on a log scale) to CMR estimates of population density, after accounting for uncertainty of CMR estimates by using a bootstrap procedure. AI-p was slightly better correlated to population density (r = 0.76) than AI-v (r = 0.58). The positive correlation of AI-p and AI-v with CMR density estimates as well as the reduced costs of conducting surveys by car instead on foot (-47\%) suggest that diurnal vehicle counts of roe deer can provide a suitable abundance index to monitor temporal trends in roe deer populations at operational management scales. For reliable management of wildlife populations, diurnal vehicle counts of roe deer could be used in association with measures of animal performance and herbivore impacts on the habitat, within the framework of the indicators of ecological change.},

We have used data from 21 surveys of mountain ungulates in the Iberian Peninsula, France and the Italian Alps. Data from such surveys were analyzed with the program Distance 6.0. Our analyses show that estimated density can be higher for higher levels of data truncation. We also confirm that the estimates tend to be more precise when data are analyzed without binning and without truncating. We found no evidence of size biased sampling as group size and distances were uncorrelated in most of our surveys. Despite distance sampling being a fairly robust methodology, it can be sensitive to some data analysis strategies.},

Another concern in aerial surveys is accounting for undetected animals (i.e., visibility bias). Currently, a stratified random block-survey design (hereafter, block-surveys) is used to develop moose (Alces alces) population estimates in several regions of North America. In this case study, we evaluated the application of distance sampling as an alternative to block-surveys in Alberta, Canada. We conducted distance-sampling surveys in 2010 and 2012 and compared density estimates, precision (coeff. of variation) and flight effort (hr/100 km(2) of survey area) to block-surveys flown in 2002, 2007, 2009, and 2012. To assess sightability bias and subsequently correct for moose missed on the transect line, we developed a predictive sightability model using 41 sightability trials with 21 radiocollared moose in 2009 and 2010. Without correcting for visibility bias on the transect line, distance sampling was more efficient in terms of flight-hours than block-surveys, while providing population estimates with similar or higher precision. Estimated sightability on the transect line was 67\% in 2010 and 46\% in 2012, which was used to re-scale the detection functions. Considering that population estimates from block-surveys as applied in Alberta are based on observable moose, distance sampling with a sightability correction likely provided more accurate estimates. Our results support the application of distance sampling as an alternative to block-surveys, but we suggest further investigation of methods for correcting visibility bias on the transect line.

  abstract = {Grauer's gorillas (Gorilla beringei graueri) have declined drastically across their range in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). Survey data analysed in 2016 estimated a 77\% decline in numbers between the mid- 1990s and 2016 and predicted that Kahuzi-Biega National Park (KBNP), and the contiguous Oku Community Reserve (OCR) held much of the global population. An estimate of 3800 Grauer's gorillas was made across its range at that time. Here, we publish the most extensive survey of Grauer's gorilla numbers to date, using nest counts from 230 line transects across KBNP and OCR to derive more accurate estimates of both gorilla and chimpanzee numbers. Gorilla numbers were estimated from line transects at 1,571 (95\% confidence interval [CI]: 824–2,993) within KBNP and at 2,244 (95\% CI: 1,471–3,422) in OCR. Eastern chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii) numbers were estimated at 2,500 (95\% CI: 1,804–3,462) in KBNP and 687 (95\% CI: 472–999) in OCR. Estimates of total numbers for the survey area were 5,252 (95\% CI: 3,687–7,481) Grauer's gorillas and 4,275 (95\% CI: 3,322–5,502) eastern chimpanzees. Chimpanzee numbers were not significantly different from the estimates in the mid-1990s but the gorillas had significantly declined, mostly in KBNP. Modeled densities of these apes indicated that distances to mines, villages, or roads significantly explained part of the distribution of these apes, with higher densities also found in more rugged and remote sites. Other primates have all declined in this region, likely due to bushmeat hunting, especially the Endangered Ulindi River Red Colobus Piliocolobus lulindicus. These results confirm the negative impact of insecurity on Grauer's gorilla but indicate that the population declines may not be as great as previously feared.

  abstract = {Techniques for estimation of absolute abundance of wildlife Populations have received a lot of attention in recent years, The statistical research has been focused on intensive small-scale studies. Recently. however. wildlife biologists have desired to study populations of animals at very large scales for monitoring purposes. Population indices are widely used in these extensive monitoring programs because they are inexpensive compared to estimates of absolute abundance. A crucial underlying assumption is that the population index (0 is directly proportional to the Population density (D), The proportionality constant.. is simply the probability of 'detection' for animals in the survey. As spatial and temporal comparisons of indices are crucial, it is necessary to also assume that the probability of detection is constant over space and time. Biologists intuitively recognize this when they design rigid protocols for the studies where the indices are collected. Unfortunately. however, in many field studies the assumption is clearly invalid. We believe that the estimation of detection probability should be built into the monitoring design through a double sampling approach. A large sample of points provides an abundance index, and a smaller sub-sample of the same point,, is used to estimate detection probability. There is an important need for statistical research on the design and analysis of these complex studies. Some basic concepts based on actual avian. amphibian, and fish monitoring studies are presented in this article. Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley Sons Ltd.},

  abstract = {Abundance estimates are important to management of most harvested species of wildlife. In West Greenland, recent estimates of barren-ground caribou Rangifer tarandus groenlandicus population size have been derived from aerial surveys conducted in early March of numerous short (7.5 km) transects that focused on obtaining high detection probabilities. The resultant study area coverage was low ({$<$}= 1.6\%), in part due to the survey design. In this article, we conducted a critical review of the current West Greenland caribou survey methodology using data from past surveys and recent GPS collar data, and present recommendations to improve the methodology. On an annual basis, movement rates of collared females were lowest in March, supporting survey timing. March distribution of collared caribou, however, differed markedly between 2009 and 2010, indicating that stratification flights prior to each survey are required to produce the most accurate and precise estimates. A viewshed analysis in GIS supported the use of a 300-m strip width, but demonstrated that the current 15-m survey flight altitude resulted in 4-5\% availability bias due to the portion of the strip width hidden by topography and out of sight of observers, and a corresponding nil detection probability for caribou in these areas. A 30-m or 45-m flight height may be more appropriate to reduce the availability bias in this rugged terrain. Examination of the population composition data collected during and after abundance estimates suggested that robust calf:cow and bull:cow ratio data could be obtained with less sampling effort distributed proportionate to the population density. We suggest that systematic strip transects should be considered to increase survey coverage; this design would increase survey efficiency (ratio of helicopter time to coverage) and inherently increase precision. Distance sampling collected by group would be an improvement over the current negatively biased, transect-total method to calculate detection probabilities. Managers should ensure that sufficient resources are available to obtain robust estimates of abundance and composition of West Greenland caribou. These recommendations may be applicable to other areas in which ungulate populations exist in heterogeneous habitats with low sightability.},

  abstract = {Conservation outcomes are principally achieved through the protection of intact habitat or the restoration of degraded habitat. Restoration is generally considered a lower priority action than protection because protection is thought to provide superior outcomes, at lower costs, without the time delay required for restoration. Yet while it is broadly accepted that protected intact habitat safeguards more biodiversity and generates greater ecosystem services per unit area than restored habitat, conservation lacks a theory that can coherently compare the relative outcomes of the two actions. We use a dynamic landscape model to integrate these two actions into a unified conservation theory of protection and restoration. Using nonlinear benefit functions, we show that both actions are crucial components of a conservation strategy that seeks to optimise either biodiversity conservation or ecosystem services provision. In contrast to conservation orthodoxy, in some circumstances, restoration should be strongly preferred to protection. The relative priority of protection and restoration depends on their costs and also on the different time lags that are inherent to both protection and restoration. We derive a simple and easy-to-interpret heuristic that integrates these factors into a single equation that applies equally to biodiversity conservation and ecosystem service objectives. We use two examples to illustrate the theory: bird conservation in tropical rainforests and coastal defence provided by mangrove forests.},

  abstract = {The Key Largo woodrat (Neotoma floridana smalli) is an endangered rodent with a restricted geographic range and small population size. Establishing an efficient monitoring program of its abundance has been problematic; previous trapping designs have not worked well because the species is sparsely distributed. We compared Key Largo woodrat abundance estimates in Key Largo, Florida, USA, obtained using trapping point transects (TPT) and spatially explicit capture-recapture (SECR) based on statistical properties, survey effort, practicality, and cost. Both methods combine aspects of distance sampling with capture-recapture, but TPT relies on radiotracking individuals to estimate detectability and SECR relies on repeat capture information to estimate densities of home ranges. Abundance estimates using TPT in the spring of 2007 and 2008 were 333 woodrats (CV = 0.46) and 696 (CV = 0.43), respectively. Abundance estimates using SECR in the spring, summer, and winter of 2007 were 97 (CV = 0.31), 334 (CV = 0.26), and 433 (CV = 0.20) animals, respectively. Trapping point transects used approximately 960 person-hours and 1,010 trap-nights/season. Spatially explicit capture-recapture used approximately 500 person-hours and 6,468 trap-nights/season. Significant time was saved in the SECR survey by setting large numbers of traps close together, minimizing time walking between traps. Trapping point transects were practical to implement in the field, and valuable auxiliary information on Key Largo woodrat behavior was obtained via radiocollaring. In this particular study, detectability of the woodrat using TPT was very low and consequently the SECR method was more efficient. Both methods require a substantial investment in survey effort to detect any change in abundance because of large uncertainty in estimates. (C) 2016 The Wildlife Society.},

Large, remote protected areas are thought to best safeguard forest elephants by supporting large populations buffered from habitat fragmentation, edge effects and human pressures. One such area, the Minkébé National Park (MNP), Gabon, was created chiefly for its reputation of harboring a large elephant population. MNP held the highest densities of elephants in Central Africa at the turn of the century, and was considered a critical sanctuary for forest elephants because of its relatively large size and isolation. We assessed population change in the park and its surroundings between 2004 and 2014. Using two independent modeling approaches, we estimated a 78–81\% decline in elephant numbers over ten years — a loss of more than 25,000 elephants. While poaching occurs from within Gabon, cross-border poaching largely drove the precipitous drop in elephant numbers. With nearly 50\% of forest elephants in Central Africa thought to reside in Gabon  [1] , their loss from the park is a considerable setback for the preservation of the species.},

The rationale is that increased accessibility of the best available evidence will provide a more efficient and less biased platform for decision making. We argue that there are significant benefits for conservation in using such a framework, but the scientific community needs to undertake and disseminate more systematic reviews before the full benefit can be realized. We devised a set of guidelines for undertaking formalized systematic review, based on a health services model. The guideline stages include planning and conducting a review, including protocol formation, search strategy, data inclusion, data extraction, and analysis. Review dissemination is addressed in terms of current developments and future plans for a Web-based open-access library. By the use of case studies we highlight critical modifications to guidelines for protocol formulation, data-quality assessment, data extraction, and data synthesis for conservation and environmental management. Ecological data presented significant but soluble challenges for the systematic review process, particularly in terms of the quantity, accessibility, and diverse quality of available data. In the field of conservation and environmental management there needs to be further engagement of scientists and practitioners to develop and take ownership of an evidence-based framework.},

The cover estimates by the three methods were compared with 'true' values measured on photographs using an image analysis technique. VE had the highest accuracy, precision and sensitivity. PF systematically overestimated cover. The greatest drawback of PF was the low sensitivity to species detection. It failed to detect 22-30\% of the species in two forests and a bog. SF has high precision and sensitivity but low accuracy. Time consumption on one quadrat was about 6 min for VE and SF, 8.5 min for PE Inter- and intra-person error with the three methods depends on plants. Inter-person error with VE was slightly greater for small and wide-spread plants, especially mosses, than for other life-forms. For wide-spread plants, intra-person error was slightly greater with PF than with the other methods.

  abstract = {Aims Knowledge of species richness is of prime importance to both basic and applied aspects of ecological studies. However, quantifying plant species richness in the tropics is potentially time-consuming because of high species diversity. Plant species richness estimates are also frequently biased, because many rare species are not detected. To address these problems, the use of a variable area method has been proposed as an alternative to fixed area methods, but its applicability to plants with aggregated distributions has been questioned based on simulation studies. We use empirical data to compare the efficiency and accuracy of a variable area method and a fixed area method for estimating species richness, density and basal area for plants with aggregated distributions, using palms as a model taxon. Methods Adult palms were sampled in twenty 10 x 30 m transects in an Atlantic Forest in Rio de Janeiro state, Brazil. All individuals were considered in the fixed area method, while in the variable area method only the first six adults in each transect were sampled; in this case, transect length was defined according to the distance of the sixth adult from the beginning of the transect. When fewer than six individuals were observed in a given transect, transect length was extended up to 50 m to search for additional individuals. The efficiency of both methods was compared based on species rarefaction curves, using the Chao 1 statistic (for abundance data). For each species we calculated mean density per transect and basal area, according to each sampling method. Sampling effort in terms of the number of individual plants and the area necessary to characterize maximum species richness in each sampling method, as well as mean time taken to sample a single transect, were compared as measures of efficiency. Important findings An accurate estimate of species richness was achieved using both methods, but in the variable area method, a quarter of the number of individuals and half the area was sufficient to characterize maximum species richness. Density and basal area did not differ between methods for any of the species studied. In the fixed area method sampling effort was 90 min per transect, whereas in the variable area method it was 30 min per transect. The variable area method, with its faster assessment of palm species richness, should facilitate greater spatial representativeness by making it easier to sample a larger number of plots at different spatial scales. We thus find sufficient evidence to recommend the variable area method for rapid and robust evaluations of species richness for palms with aggregate distributions, as well as for other plants with similar spatial patterns, in tropical forests.},

  abstract = {Broad-leaved subtropical forests are the most productive, diversified, and complex ecosystems on the planet. Unfortunately, they are currently under severe threat from anthropogenic activities, such as. deforestation, housing settlements, and agricultural expansion. In response to these severe effects, the present study was conducted to explore the current conservation status and population structure of a wide range of bird species inhabiting different subtropical broad-leaved urban forests of Pakistan. In total, 2879 individuals comprising 53 species and 28 families were detected between December 2017 and November 2018 as revealed through the distance sampling line transect method. The habitat selection among bird species varied according to vegetation structure and composition, food resources, adjoining habitats, and human settlements. According to IUCN Red List data, one species was deemed vulnerable out of 53 bird species, while the remaining 52 species were ranked as ofleast concern. The findings of the density analysis revealed that bird density varied between six subtropical broad-leaved forests. Palamar (3.954 +/- 0.221 birds/ha) and Kityari (3.138 +/- 0.162 birds/ha) were densely populated, whereas Kamal Khan (1.102 +/- 0.178 birds/ha) was of the least concern. Likewise, the diversity analysis showed that Kamal Khan was a more diverse habitat (Shannon-Wiener Index; H' = 3.581 +/- 0.021). Shahabad was richer (Margalef Richness Index; R1 = 8.007 +/- 0.053) and Dob Ghar was evenly distributed (Pielou J Evenness Index; E = 0.940 +/- 0.005) compared to other urban habitats studied. Eight foraging guilds were identified among the bird species. Insectivores were the most abundant bird species utilizing the urban dwelling habitats. carnivores/piscivores/insectivores utilized Dob Ghar forest, while more frugivores utilized Kamal Khan and Dob Ghar. Based on the data, it was concluded that subtropical broad-leaved urban forests are dynamic, complex, and of vital significance for a diverse range of bird species.},

  abstract = {The continued growth of human populations and of per capita consumption have resulted in unsustainable exploitation of Earth's biological diversity, exacerbated by climate change, ocean acidification, and other anthropogenic environmental impacts. We argue that effective conservation of biodiversity is essential for human survival and the maintenance of ecosystem processes. Despite some conservation successes (especially at local scales) and increasing public and government interest in living sustainably, biodiversity continues to decline. Moving beyond 2010, successful conservation approaches need to be reinforced and adequately financed. In addition, however, more radical changes are required that recognize biodiversity as a global public good, that integrate biodiversity conservation into policies and decision frameworks for resource production and consumption, and that focus on wider institutional and societal changes to enable more effective implementation of policy.}

In this paper, we develop a socio-economicecological model of optimal management of wildlife preservation areas through incorporating the environmental preferences of local communities. These preferences are dynamic and influenced by local economic growth. When environmental preferences of local communities are brought in sync with those of the regulators, monitoring and regulatory policies aimed at curbing illegal smuggling become efficacious. Our results indicate that when communities residing in the vicinity of wildlife protection areas see a rapid change in their environmental preferences owing to economic development within the region, it aids in biodiversity protection by making stringent monitoring and regulatory measures acceptable. However, promoting economic development may require providing higher access to biodiversity preservation areas in the initial stages even if it comes at the cost of mild habitat degradation. When the probability of catching illegal smugglers is a function of cooperation received from the local inhabitants, it is optimal to invest in policy measures that improve local economic well-being and willingness to cooperate before increasing monitoring efforts.},

We compared estimates of detection probability and density from distance and time-removal models and survey protocols based on 5- or 10-min counts and outer radii of 50 or 100 m. We surveyed singing male Acadian flycatchers (Empidonax virescens), cerulean warblers (Dendroica cerulea), Kentucky warblers (Oporornis formosus), Louisiana waterthrushes (Parkesia motacilla), wood thrushes (Hylocichla mustelina), and worm-eating warblers (Helmitheros vermivorum) in bottomland and upland forest across 5 states in the Central Hardwoods Bird Conservation Region during the breeding season in 2007 and 2008. Detection probabilities differed between distance and time-removal models and species detectabilities were affected differently by year, forest type, and state. Density estimates from distance models were generally higher than from time-removal models, resulting from lower detection probabilities estimated by distance models. We found support for individual heterogeneity (modeled as a finite mixture model) in the time-removal models and that 50-m radius counts generated density estimates approximately twice as high as 100-m radius counts. Users should be aware that in addition to estimating different components of detectability, density estimates derived from distance and time-removal models can be affected by survey protocol because some count durations and plot radii may better meet model assumptions than others. The choice of a method may not affect the use of estimates for relative comparisons (e. g., when comparing habitats) but could affect conclusions when used to estimate population size. We recommend careful consideration of assumptions when deciding on point-count protocol and selection of analysis methods. (C) 2011 The Wildlife Society.},

This study illustrates distinct wildlife responses to logging and hunting in RDS sectors that vary in protection and enforcement levels and the erosion of some critical animal communities across the RDS in the face of challenges of increasing human populations and flows of arms and ammunitions there. Our results show elephants (Loxodonta africana cyclotis) to be appreciably absent close to human settlements, and increasingly vulnerable to hunting in the more integrally protected sectors far from town.

  abstract = {Presence-absence surveys are a commonly used method for monitoring broad-scale changes in wildlife distributions. However, the lack of power of these surveys for detecting population trends is problematic for their application in wildlife management. Options for improving power include increasing the sampling effort or arbitrarily relaxing the type I error rate. We present an alternative, whereby targeted sampling of particular habitats in the landscape using information from a habitat model increases power. The advantage of this approach is that it does not require a trade-off with either cost or the Pr(type I error) to achieve greater power. We use a demographic model of koala (Phascolarctos cinereus) population dynamics and simulations of the monitoring process to estimate the power to detect a trend in occupancy for a range of strategies, thereby demonstrating that targeting particular habitat qualities can improve power substantially. If the objective is to detect a decline in occupancy, the optimal strategy is to sample high-quality habitats. Alternatively, if the objective is to detect an increase in occupancy, the optimal strategy is to sample intermediate-quality habitats. The strategies with the highest power remained the same under a range of parameter assumptions, although observation error had a strong influence on the optimal strategy. Our approach specifically applies to monitoring for detecting long-term trends in occupancy or abundance. This is a common and important monitoring objective for wildlife managers, and we provide guidelines for more effectively achieving it.},

  abstract = {The negative impact of bushmeat hunting on prey species has been frequently claimed, but little thought has been given to how the level of hunting should most appropriately be measured. Current methods range from qualitative descriptions to quantified measures, and in many cases these are used to infer the biological impact of hunting, when they are in fact economic measures of the effort invested by a hunter. The choice of measure used has important implications for correctly attributing observed levels of prey abundance to a particular level of hunting, and for the use of hunting statistic data as an index of abundance. Using information from over 200 hunter follows and eight hunting camp diaries collected over a 15 month period in Equatorial Guinea, we investigate how hunting effort is most appropriately measured. We explore the use of time as a measure of effort, the effect of hunting method and compare hunter and prey perspectives of catch, in order to investigate the possible sources of bias associated with different measures. We show (1) that total time measures can be biased, overestimating biologically relevant effort; (2) that quantifying trapping effort is problematic due to variable trap checking rates, variable trap group composition and species trap specificity; and (3) that economically relevant measures of catch, taken from the hunter perspective underestimate the true biological impact of hunting. To our knowledge this is the first study to investigate and explicitly quantify the sources of bias that exist between different hunting effort measures. our results have important implications for how future studies should measure hunting effort in order to assess properly the biological impact of bushmeat hunting, but further comparative studies are needed to investigate the existence of biased effort measures in a range of hunting systems.

  abstract = {Growing threats to biodiversity in the tropics mean there is an increasing need for effective monitoring that balances scientific rigor with practical feasibility. Alternatives to professional techniques are emerging that are based on the involvement of local people. Such locally based monitoring methods may be more sustainable over time, allow greater spatial coverage and quicker management decisions, lead to increased compliance, and help encourage attitude shifts toward more environmentally sustainable practices. Nevertheless, few studies have yet compared the findings or cost-effectiveness of locally based methods with professional techniques or investigated the power of locally based methods to detect trends. We gathered data on bushmeat-hunting catch and effort using a professional technique (accompanying hunters on hunting trips) and two locally based methods in which data were collected by hunters (hunting camp diaries and weekly hunter interviews) in a 15-month study in Equatorial Guinea. Catch and effort results from locally based methods were strongly correlated with those of the professional technique and the spatial locations of hunting trips reported in the locally based methods accurately reflected those recorded with the professional technique. We used power simulations of catch and effort data to show that locally based methods can reliably detect meaningful levels of change (20\% change with 80\% power at significance level [alpha] = 0.05) in multispecies catch per unit effort. Locally based methods were the most cost-effective for monitoring. Hunter interviews collected catch and effort data on 240\% more hunts per person hour and 94\% more hunts per unit cost, spent on monitoring, than the professional technique. Our results suggest that locally based monitoring can offer an accurate, cost-effective, and sufficiently powerful method to monitor the status of natural resources. To establish such a system in Equatorial Guinea, the current lack of national and local capacity for monitoring and management must be addressed.},

  abstract = {Understanding the impact of hunting on wildlife populations is crucial to achieving sustainability and requires knowledge of prey abundance responses to different levels of exploitation. While the abundance of primates has been shown to respond independently to hunting and habitat, habitat is rarely considered simultaneously when evaluating the impacts of hunting. Furthermore, the importance of these two factors in determining the abundance of other species has not been well investigated. We evaluate the independent effects of hunting and habitat on the abundance of a diverse assemblage of species, using a series of predictions and data from a study in Equatorial Guinea. Line transect surveys in sites of varying hunting intensity and habitat, and weekly interviews with hunters on current hunting effort in each site, were conducted. We also consider the role of past hunting, and discuss the interrelationships between hunting and habitat variables. We show that for primates, hunting is important in determining abundance, while for rodents and duikers, habitat is more important. Our findings show that the effects of hunting and habitat on abundance vary greatly between species, are often confounded and require an approach that isolates their independent effects to determine the true impact of hunting. Conservation managers must consider and incorporate habitat heterogeneity when managing hunting systems, taking into account the way in which the relative importance of these factors can vary between species.},

The traditional distance sampling framework is further extended to account for multiple scan positions at a single sample plot and to allow for an imperfect detection probability at distance r = 0. The novel methodology is tested with real world data, as well as in simulations. It is shown that the underlying detection model can be parameterized using only data from single scans. Hereby, it is possible to predict the detection probability also for different sample plot sizes and scanner position layouts in a multi-scan setting. Simulations showed that a minor discretization bias can occur if the sample size is small. The methodology enables a generalized optimization of the scanning layout in a multi-scan setting with respect to the detection probability and the sample plot area. This will increase the efficiency of multi-scan TLS-based forest inventories in the future.},

Traditional sampling techniques, such as Fixed Area Sampling, Angle Count Sampling and Line Intersect Sampling, do not regard this fact and may be inefficient for surveys of DW, because of limited search areas. A sampling technique that should remedy this shortcoming is Point Transect Sampling (Buckland et al. in Introduction to distance sampling: estimating abundance of biological populations. Oxford University Press, Oxford, 2001; Advanced distance sampling: estimating abundance of biological populations. Oxford University Press, Oxford, 2004), where as a matter of principle, all objects that are sighted from a fixed location are counted. We compare Point Transect Sampling with the other well-established sampling approaches for the estimation of volume, necro-mass and carbon storage in terms of precision and sampling effort. It is shown that Point Transect Sampling is the superior method for sampling standing DW regarding efficiency, whereas for sampling downed DW, it is clearly outperformed by Line Intersect Sampling.},

  abstract = {Population monitoring is an essential component of endangered species recovery programs. The federally endangered Diamond Darter Crystallaria cincotta is in need of an effective monitoring design to improve our understanding of its distribution and track population trends. Because of their small size, cryptic coloration, and nocturnal behavior, along with limitations associated with current sampling methods, individuals are difficult to detect at known occupied sites. Therefore, research is needed to determine if survey efforts can be improved by increasing probability of individual detection. The primary objective of this study was to determine if there are seasonal and diel patterns in Diamond Darter detectability during population surveys. In addition to temporal factors, we also assessed five habitat variables that might influence individual detection. We used N-mixture models to estimate site abundances and relationships between covariates and individual detectability and ranked models using Akaike's information criteria. During 2015 three known occupied sites were sampled 15 times each between May and Oct. The best supported model included water temperature as a quadratic function influencing individual detectability, with temperatures around 22 C resulting in the highest detection probability. Detection probability when surveying at the optimal temperature was approximately 6\% and 7.5\% greater than when surveying at 16 C and 29 C, respectively. Time of Night and day of year were not strong predictors of Diamond Darter detectability. The results of this study will allow researchers and agencies to maximize detection probability when surveying populations, resulting in greater monitoring efficiency and likely more precise abundance estimates.}

  abstract = {Although investigators have evaluated the efficacy of survey methods for assessing densities of breeding birds, few comparisons have been made of survey methods for wintering birds, especially in grasslands. In winter, social behavior and spatial distributions often differ from those in the breeding season. We evaluated the degree of correspondence between density estimates based on different survey methods. Surveys were conducted during two winters (2001–2002 and 2002–2003) on 16 grassland sites in southwestern Oklahoma. Line-transect (using a detection function to account for birds present but not detected) and area-search (where density was based on the total count within a given area) methods were employed. Observations on line transects were also analyzed as strip transects, where density was based on total count within a given strip width and no detection function was used. Savannah Sparrows (Passerculus sandwichensis), LeConte’s Sparrows (Ammodramus leconteii), Song Sparrows (Melospiza melodia), Smith’s Longspurs (Calcarius pictus), Chestnut-collared Longspurs (C . ornatus), and Eastern Meadowlarks (Sturnella magna) were sufficiently abundant to allow comparison. Area-search density estimates tended to be higher than line-transect estimates for Savannah Sparrows, Song Sparrows, and Eastern Meadowlarks, suggesting that some individuals initially located close to the transect line were not detected on line transects. The area-search and line-transect methods gave similar density estimates for Chestnut-collared and Smith’s longspurs. Area-search estimates of Eastern Meadowlarks were significantly higher in the second year of the study only. For this species, area-search estimates did not differ from those of strip transects covering an equal area, so the reason for the differing meadowlark estimates is not clear. Higher density estimates using the area-search method likely resulted from: (1) birds that might escape detection by hiding were more likely detected (flushed) during area searches because of the repeated passes through the area, and (2) birds close to the line in line transects escape detection by hiding, biasing those estimates low. We also evaluated the correspondence of density rankings for the six species as determined by the different survey methods and for the same species across survey sites. Correlations among the six species of the area-search results with those of line transects and strip transects generally were high, increasing in 2002–2003 when densities of birds were greater. All three methods provided similar density rankings among species. Density rankings within species across sites for the four non-longspur species generally were concordant for the three methods, suggesting that any of them will adequately reflect among-site differences, especially when densities vary greatly across sites. Further research is needed to determine the extent to which grassland birds are missed on line transects. We suggest that workers using line transects to study these species give careful consideration and make additional efforts to satisfy the distance-sampling assumption that all birds on or near the line are detected. If density is measured as a total count in a fixed area, we recommend that observers pass within {$<$}10 m of all points in the area.},

  abstract = {Unsustainable hunting of wildlife or bushmeat for human consumption across the tropics threatens both wildlife populations and the livelihoods of people who depend on these resources. The probability that hunting can be sustainable depends in part on ecological conditions that affect the ‘supply’ of and ‘demand’ for wildlife resources. In this study, supply is estimated across a number of tropical ecosystem types by calculating the theoretical ‘maximum sustainable offtake’ in kg/km2 for harvestable wildlife. Demand is estimated from observed harvests in kg/km2. We examine how supply and demand vary across relatively undisturbed ecosystems, indexed by annual rainfall. Supply is potentially highest in dry forests and wetter savannah grasslands and decreases in moist forests and more xeric grasslands. Demand tends to exceed supply in moist forests and xeric grasslands. Analogous to this ecological variation along the rainfall gradient is the gradient created by the conversion of tropical forests by humans. We hypothesise that the wild meat supply is greater in secondary forests and forest–farm–fallow mosaics than in undisturbed forests and test this with available data. We conclude that the probability that hunting will be sustainable varies with ecosystem type and degree of human disturbance and should influence where land is zoned for protected areas and where for wildlife harvests.},

Structured decision making (SDM) provides a formal decision analytic framework for evaluating difficult decisions by breaking decisions into component parts and separating the values of stakeholders from the scientific evaluation of management actions and uncertainty. The result is a rigorous, transparent, and values-driven process. This decision-aiding process provides the decision maker with a more complete understanding of the problem and the effects of potential management actions on stakeholder values, as well as how key uncertainties can affect the decision. We use a case study to illustrate how SDM can be used as a decision-aiding tool for management decision making at large scales. We evaluated alternative white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) buck-harvest regulations in New York designed to reduce harvest of yearling bucks, taking into consideration the values of the state wildlife agency responsible for managing deer, as well as deer hunters. We incorporated tradeoffs about social, ecological, and economic management concerns throughout the state. Based on the outcomes of predictive models, expert elicitation, and hunter surveys, the SDM process identified management alternatives that optimized competing objectives. The SDM process provided biologists and managers insight about aspects of the buck-harvest decision that helped them adopt a management strategy most compatible with diverse hunter values and management concerns.},

We identify unprotected areas of the world that have remarkably high conservation value (irreplaceability) and are under serious threat. These areas concentrate overwhelmingly in tropical and subtropical moist forests, particularly on tropical mountains and islands.

Decision makers managing threatened or pest species are regularly faced with this uncertainty. Wildlife diseases can drive species to extinction; thus, managing species with disease is an important part of conservation. Devil facial tumor disease (DFTD) is one such disease that led to the listing of the Tasmanian devil (Sarcophilus harrisii) as endangered. Managers aim to maintain devils in the wild by establishing disease-free insurance populations at isolated sites. Often a resident DFTD-affected population must first be removed. In a successful collaboration between decision scientists and wildlife managers, we used an accessible population model to inform monitoring decisions and facilitate the establishment of an insurance population of devils on Forestier Peninsula. We used a Bayesian catch-effort model to estimate population size of a diseased population from removal and camera trap data. We also analyzed the costs and benefits of declaring the area disease-free prior to reintroduction and establishment of a healthy insurance population. After the monitoring session in May-June 2015, the probability that all devils had been successfully removed was close to 1, even when we accounted for a possible introduction of a devil to the site. Given this high probability and the baseline cost of declaring population absence prematurely, we found it was not cost-effective to carry out any additional monitoring before introducing the insurance population. Considering these results within the broader context of Tasmanian devil management, managers ultimately decided to implement an additional monitoring session before the introduction. This was a conservative decision that accounted for uncertainty in model estimates and for the broader nonmonetary costs of mistakenly declaring the area disease-free.},

  abstract = {1. Calibrating indices of animal abundance to true densities is critical in wildlife studies especially when direct density estimations are precluded by high costs, lack of required data or model parameters, elusiveness and rarity of target species. For studies deploying camera traps, the use of photographic rate (photographs per sampling time) as an index of abundance potentially applies to the majority of terrestrial mammals where individual recognition, and hence capture-recapture analysis, are unfeasible. The very few studies addressing this method have either been limited by lack of independence between trapping rates and density estimations, or because they combined different species, thus introducing potential bias in camera trap detection rates. This study uses a single model species from several sites to analyse calibration of trapping rates to independently derived estimations of density. The study also makes the first field test of the method by Rowcliffe et al. (2008) for density derivation from camera trapping rates based on modelling animal-camera contacts. 2. We deployed camera traps along line transects at six sites in the Udzungwa Mountains of Tanzania and correlated trapping rates of Harvey's duiker Cephalophus harveyi with densities estimated from counts made along the same transects. 3. We found a strong, linear relationship (R(2) = 0.90) between trapping rate and density. Sampling precision analysis indicates that camera trapping rates reach satisfactory precision when trapping effort amounts to 250-300 camera days. Density estimates using Rowcliffe et al.'s (2008) gas model conversion are higher than from transect censuses; we discuss the possible reasons and stress the need for more field tests. 4. Synthesis and applications. Subject to rigorous and periodic calibration, and standardization of sampling procedures in time and over different sites, camera trapping rate is shown to be, in this study, a valid index of density in the target species. Comparative data indicate that this may also apply to forest ungulates in general. The method has great potential for standardizing monitoring programmes and reducing the costs of wildlife surveys, especially in remote areas.},

The habitat quality of these forests differs in forest size, vegetation type, human impact and level of protection. The red duiker (Cephalophus natalensis harveyi Thomas 1893) was the only species regularly seen (mean of 0.16 animals seen per km walked) at one of the three sites, Mwanihana Forest, a large forest block within the Udzungwa Mountains National Park ranging in altitude from 300-2100 m. Counts of antelope tracks and dung piles were used to supplement information from areas where no direct observations were scored. This study provides the first account of the abundance of forest antelopes in the Udzungwa Mountains and confirms that methodological problems — such as poor antelope detectability due to understorey vegetation and difficulties in identifying antelope species — are inherent in estimations of forest antelope density by line transect counts. Combining counts of indirect signs with direct counts increases the information for some species and comparable data show that camera-trapping can also greatly supplement the information, especially for more elusive and/or more nocturnal species.},

A common objective of such studies is to evaluate the relationship between abundance or density and covariates that describe animal habitat or other environmental influences. However, little attention has been focused on methods of modeling abundance covariate effects in conventional distance-sampling models. In this paper we propose a distance-sampling model that accommodates covariate effects on abundance. The model is based on specification of the distance-sampling likelihood at the level of the sample unit in terms of local abundance (for each sampling unit). This model is augmented with a Poisson regression model for local abundance that is parameterized in terms of available covariates. Maximum-likelihood estimation of detection and density parameters is based on the integrated likelihood, wherein local abundance is removed from the likelihood by integration. We provide an example using avian point-transect data of Ovenbirds (Seiurus aurocapillus) collected using a distance-sampling protocol and two measures of habitat structure (understory cover and basal area of overstory trees). The model yields a sensible description (positive effect of understory cover, negative effect on basal area) of the relationship between habitat and Ovenbird density that can be used to evaluate the effects of habitat management on Ovenbird populations.},

Such surveys often generate sparse count data from which it is difficult to estimate population size while formally accounting for detection probability. In this article, I describe a class of models (N-mixture models) which allow for estimation of population size from such data. The key idea is to view site-specific population sizes, N, as independent random variables distributed according to some mixing distribution (e.g., Poisson). Prior parameters are estimated from the marginal likelihood of the data, having integrated over the prior distribution for N. Carroll and Lombard (1985, Journal of American Statistical Association 80, 423–426) proposed a class of estimators based on mixing over a prior distribution for detection probability. Their estimator can be applied in limited settings, but is sensitive to prior parameter values that are fixed a priori. Spatial replication provides additional information regarding the parameters of the prior distribution on N that is exploited by the N-mixture models and which leads to reasonable estimates of abundance from sparse data. A simulation study demonstrates superior operating characteristics (bias, confidence interval coverage) of the N-mixture estimator compared to the Caroll and Lombard estimator. Both estimators are applied to point count data on six species of birds illustrating the sensitivity to choice of prior on p and substantially different estimates of abundance as a consequence.},

Previously, models have been developed primarily for fixed trap arrays which define the observable locations of individuals by a set of discrete points. 2. Here, we develop a class of models for ‘search-encounter’ data, i.e. for detections of recognizable individuals in continuous space, not restricted to trap locations. In our hierarchical model, detection probability is related to the average distance between individual location and the survey path. The locations are allowed to change over time owing to movements of individuals, and individual locations are related formally by a model describing individual activity or home range centre which is itself regarded as a latent variable in the model. We provide a Bayesian analysis of the model in WinBUGS, and develop a custom MCMC algorithm in the R language. 3. The model is applied to simulated data and to territory mapping data for the Willow Tit from the Swiss Breeding Bird Survey MHB. While the observed density was 15 territories per nominal 1 km2 plot of unknown effective sample area, the model produced a density estimate of 21·12 territories per square km (95\% posterior interval: 17–26). 4. Spatial capture–recapture models are relevant to virtually all animal population studies that seek to estimate population size or density, yet existing models have been proposed mainly for conventional sampling using arrays of traps. Our model for search-encounter data, where the spatial pattern of searching can be arbitrary and may change over occasions, greatly expands the scope and utility of spatial capture–recapture models.},

  abstract = {1. Monitoring red fox Vulpes vulpes abundance is necessary to assess the status and management of this species and to understand predator-prey relationships. Spotlight counts are most often used for this purpose. However, comparisons between regions or over years may be questionable when using encounter rates, i.e. the number of foxes seen per kilometre. We evaluated whether distance-sampling methods, which take account of variation in visibility, could be applied to spotlight counts of foxes along roads and trails. 2. Distance-sampling methods were used at 12 contrasting sites in France in a systematic design with equally spaced transects or points. Line and point transects were simultaneously applied at two sites to find the more precise and efficient method. 3. The number of foxes seen near the centreline was always low, although some foxes may have been missed. A peak of sightings at subsequent intervals from the centreline suggested evasive movements. 4. Despite the low sighting frequency near the centreline, which may reflect a violation of distance-sampling assumptions, a good model fit was obtained for eight out of 12 data sets using a regular 50-m grouping of the distance data. Increasing the first interval to account for evasive movement improved model fit in the four other data sets. Density estimates ranged from 0.39 to 3.54 foxes km(-2) (range of coefficient of variation 4.5-24.6\%). 5. Point and line transects resulted in similar density estimates, but point transects were more time consuming and resulted in larger coefficients of variation due to a smaller number of foxes seen by this method. Line transects may therefore produce better estimates of fox numbers. 6. There were few differences among the effective strip width estimates between the 12 sites (range 191-286 m), thus line transect estimates may have a limited advantage over encounter rates. 7. Synthesis and applications. The systematic scheme we applied in this study improved sampling design and variance estimations and should be useful for surveying terrestrial mammals with spotlight counts. However, the location of transects along roads and in open habitats probably induced biased results. Methodological improvements are necessary before spotlight distance sampling can become a routine monitoring tool for foxes.},

  abstract = {We aimed to determine optimal methods of underwater visual census (UVC) for estimating the abundance of coral reef fishes exploited by fisheries in the tropical Pacific. Two main methods were tested using SCUBA: strip transect and stationary point counts. We assessed their relative accuracy, precision, power and efficiency (cost), and compared different census area dimensions, observer swimming speeds, and number of replicates. Twenty-five comparisons of the two UVC methods were conducted for 73 species from five families of coral reef fishes, on reefs in Australia and Fiji. Species were grouped within families based on their mobility. Few significant differences were found, either among or between strip transects and stationary point counts. The data were characterised by high variability, low precision and low power. A trend for greater accuracy in density estimates of small sedentary species with smaller census area was apparent, which probably reflects searching efficiency. Only one species group, the sedentary Acanthuridae showed differences between transects and point counts. Higher, hence presumably more accurate, density estimates were obtained with 50 m x 5 m transects. Notably, point counts could be deployed in similar to 70\% of the time of transects. A bootstrapping procedure demonstrated a consistent improvement in precision of density estimates with increasing number of replicates, but no appreciable change in precision was found beyond 10 to 15 replicates, in all species groups and for both transects and point counts. Consequently, and because of the high variability inherent in fish density estimates, we recommend that at least 10 replicates be used to quantify the species considered here. The power calculations showed that only large differences in density will be detected with the replication levels typical of UVC surveys. Power was greatest for the roving serranids, with a decrease in density of about 50\% detectable for this species group. We discuss the importance of carefully defining the behavioural attributes of species prior to selecting a UVC method. A method of temporal stratification in a count is described for censusing a range of species of varying mobilities. We suggest that fish mobility and search efficiency are key factors in optimising UVC methods.},

  abstract = {Attalea palms provide primary habitat to Rhodnius spp., vectors of Trypanosoma cruzi. Flying from palms, these blood-sucking bugs often invade houses and can infect people directly or via food contamination. Chagas disease (CD) risk may therefore increase when Attalea palms thrive near houses. For example, Attalea dominate many deforested landscapes of eastern Amazonia, where acute-CD outbreaks are disturbingly frequent. Despite this possible link between deforestation and CD risk, the population-level responses of Amazonian Attalea and their resident Rhodnius to anthropogenic landscape disturbance remain largely uncharted. We studied adult Attalea palms in old-growth forest (OGF), young secondary forest (YSF), and cattle pasture (CP) in two localities of eastern Amazonia. We recorded 1856 Attalea along 10 transects (153.6 ha), and detected infestation by Rhodnius spp. in 18 of 280 systematically-sampled palms (33 bugs caught). Distance-sampling models suggest that, relative to OGF, adult Attalea density declined by 70–80\% in CP and then recovered in YSF. Site-occupancy models estimate a strong positive effect of deforestation on palm-infestation odds (βCP-infestation = 4.82±1.14 SE), with a moderate decline in recovering YSF (βYSF-infestation = 2.66±1.10 SE). Similarly, N-mixture models suggest that, relative to OGF, mean vector density sharply increased in CP palms (βCP-density = 3.20±0.62 SE) and then tapered in YSF (βYSF-density = 1.61±0.76 SE). Together, these results indicate that disturbed landscapes may support between \textasciitilde 2.5 (YSF) and \textasciitilde 5.1 (CP) times more Attalea-dwelling Rhodnius spp. per unit area than OGF. We provide evidence that deforestation may favor palm-dwelling CD vectors in eastern Amazonia. Importantly, our landscape-disturbance effect estimates explicitly take account of (i) imperfect palm and bug detection and (ii) the uncertainties about infestation and vector density arising from sparse bug data. These results suggest that incorporating landscape-disturbance metrics into the spatial stratification of transmission risk could help enhance CD surveillance and prevention in Amazonia.},

  abstract = {Conservation planning requires information at a variety of geographic scales, and it is often unclear whether surveys designed for other purposes will provide appropriate information for management at various scales. We evaluated the use of the North American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) to meet information needs for conservation planning in Bird Conservation Regions (BCRs). The BBS originally was developed to provide regional estimates for states, provinces, physiographic regions, and larger areas. Many analyses have used physiographic regions within states/provinces as strata. We evaluated potential consequences of using BCRs instead of the BBS physiographic regions, testing for spatial differences in sample intensity within states and provinces. We reclassified the BBS survey routes to BCRs and conducted route regression trend (interval-specific population change) analyses for a variety of regions and time intervals. Our results were similar to those based on traditional BBS regions and suggest minimal consequences of the reclassification for the BBS sample. We summarized population change within BCRs and assessed the efficiency of the BBS in estimating population change for 421 species surveyed. As would be expected from an omnibus survey, many species appeared to be poorly monitored by the BBS, with 42\% of species encountered at {$<$}1 bird per route from the survey, and 28\% of trend estimates too imprecise to detect a 3\% per year change over 35 years. Our results indicated that the quality of the survey for estimation of population change varied among BCRs. Population trends of species were heterogeneous over space and time, varying among BCRs for 76\% of species and over time for 39\% of species. Regional heterogeneity also existed in trends of species groups from the BBS. While 49\% of all species in the survey had increasing populations, grassland breeding birds showed consistent declines, with only 18\% of species having positive trend estimates. Bird Conservation Regions appear to provide reasonable strata for summary of BBS data.},

  abstract = {Obtaining useful estimates of wildlife abundance or density requires thoughtful attention to potential sources of bias and precision, and it is widely understood that addressing incomplete detection is critical to appropriate inference. When the underlying assumptions of sampling approaches are violated, both increased bias and reduced precision of the population estimator may result. Bear (Ursus spp.) populations can be difficult to sample and are often monitored using mark-recapture distance sampling (MRDS) methods, although obtaining adequate sample sizes can be cost prohibitive. With the goal of improving inference, we examined the underlying methodological assumptions and estimator efficiency of three datasets collected under an MRDS protocol designed specifically for bears. We analyzed these data using MRDS, conventional distance sampling (CDS), and open-distance sampling approaches to evaluate the apparent bias-precision tradeoff relative to the assumptions inherent under each approach. We also evaluated the incorporation of informative priors on detection parameters within a Bayesian context. We found that the CDS estimator had low apparent bias and was more efficient than the more complex MRDS estimator. When combined with informative priors on the detection process, precision was increased by {$>$} 50\% compared to the MRDS approach with little apparent bias. In addition, open-distance sampling models revealed a serious violation of the assumption that all bears were available to be sampled. Inference is directly related to the underlying assumptions of the survey design and the analytical tools employed. We show that for aerial surveys of bears, avoidance of unnecessary model complexity, use of prior information, and the application of open population models can be used to greatly improve estimator performance and simplify field protocols. Although we focused on distance sampling-based aerial surveys for bears, the general concepts we addressed apply to a variety of wildlife survey contexts.},

  abstract = {Managers rely on accurate estimators of wildlife abundance and trends for management decisions. Despite the focus of contemporary wildlife science on developing methods to improve inference from wildlife surveys, legacy datasets often rely on index counts that lack information about the detection process. Data integration can be a useful tool for combining index counts with data collected under more rigorous designs (i.e., designs that account for the detection process), but care is required when datasets represent different population processes or are mismatched in space and time. This can be particularly problematic in cases where animals aggregate in response to a spatially or temporally limited resource because individuals may temporarily immigrate from outside the study area and be included in the abundance index. Abundance indices based on brown bear (Ursus arctos) feeding aggregations within coastal meadows in early summer in Lake Clark National Park and Preserve, Alaska, USA, are one such example. These indices reflect the target population (brown bears residing within the park) and temporary immigrants (i.e., bears drawn from outside the park boundary). To properly account for the effects of temporary immigration, we integrated the index data with abundance data collected via park-wide distance sampling surveys, the latter of which properly addressed the detection process. By assuming that the distance data provide inference on abundance and the index counts represent some combination of abundance and temporary immigration processes, we were able to decompose the relative contribution of each to overall trend. We estimated that the density of brown bears within our study area was 38–54 adults/1,000 km2 during 2003–2019 and that abundance increased at a rate of approximately 1.4\%/year. The contribution of temporary immigrants to overall trend in the index was low, so we created 3 hypothetical scenarios to more fully demonstrate how the integrated approach could be useful in situations where the composite trend in meadow counts may obscure trends in abundance (e.g., opposing trends in abundance and temporary immigration). Our work represents a conceptual advance supporting the integration of legacy index data with more rigorous data streams and is broadly applicable in cases where trends in index values may represent a mixture of population processes.},

  abstract = {1. Effective wildlife management and conservation depends on a detailed understanding of population dynamics at large spatial scales. Distance sampling is an efficient tool for landscape-scale monitoring, and the recent development of the open-population distance sampling framework for analysis allows efficient estimation of population parameters for unmarked populations. 2. Applications of open-population distance approaches are relatively rare, and further development is required to generalize this powerful class of models for use in complex sampling scenarios. 3. Here, we extend this class of models to situations where individuals occur in groups and address: the incorporation of group composition information, fluctuations in aggregation among individuals into groups, and non-repeated survey designs. We also describe a new parameter, kappa, representing the change in the rate of aggregation of individuals into groups over time. Using simulations, we assess the performance of this extended framework, and demonstrate its utility through an applied example using a Dall's sheep (Ovis dalli dalli) dataset collected in Alaska from 2009 to 2016. 4. Our simulation study demonstrated that our extended model reliably recovered the data-generating parameter values without bias. In the applied example, we found that an abrupt decline in abundance observed in the Dall's sheep population was driven primarily by reductions in lambs and ewe-like sheep that coincided with the late onset of spring conditions in 2013. Rams were much less affected, suggesting declines in the ewe-like class drove overall population trajectory in this population. 5. This work demonstrates how ecological questions related to the dynamics of group-dwelling species may be assessed in complex sampling situations using an open-population distance sampling framework. The resulting framework is broadly applicable to a variety of species and will be especially useful for evaluating population dynamics in unmarked populations of group-dwelling species at large spatial scales.},

  abstract = {Management of large mammal populations has often been based on aerial minimum count surveys that are uncorrected for incomplete detection and lack estimates of precision. These limitations can be particularly problematic for Dall's sheep (Ovis dalli dalli) due to the high cost of surveys and variation in detection probability across time and space. The limitations of these methods have been recognized for some time, but previously proposed alternatives for sheep surveys proved to be too costly and logistically unfeasible in most circumstances (Udevitz et al. 2006). We assessed the potential for a combination of distance sampling surveys and a hierarchical modeling approach to provide a more efficient means for estimating Dall's sheep abundance by conducting aerial contour transect surveys over all sheep habitat in Gates of the Arctic National Park and Preserve (GAAR), Alaska in 2009 and 2010. We estimated the population of Dall's sheep was 8,412 (95\% CI: 6,51711,090) and 10,072 (95\% CI 8,08112,520) in 2009 and 2010, respectively. Abundance within the Itkillik Preserve area within GAAR was 1,898 (95\% CI: 1,4212,578) and 1,854 (95\% CI: 1,3422,488) in 2009 and 2010, respectively. Estimates of lamb abundance in 2010 were more than double those of 2009 after correcting for detection bias related to group size, suggesting that the apparent estimate of lambs in the population may be biased in some years depending on the degree of aggregation. Overall, the contour transect surveys were feasible logistically, cost 7080\% less than minimum count surveys, and produced precise estimates of abundance, indicating that the application of these methods could be used effectively to increase the statistical rigor and spatial extent of Dall's sheep abundance surveys throughout Alaska. These methods could be used to improve the assessment of long-term trends in populations and productivity and provide valuable information for harvest management at both local and landscape scales at reduced costs in comparison to traditional minimum count surveys.

Unsustainable hunting was the most commonly reported threat and occurred in 61\% of all PAs, followed by disturbance from recreational activities occurring in 55\%, and natural system modifications from fire or its suppression in 49\%. The number of reported threats was lower in PAs with greater remoteness, higher control of corruption, and lower human development scores. The main reported threats in developing countries were linked to overexploitation for resource extraction, while negative impacts from recreational activities dominated in developed countries.

  abstract = {Rigorous monitoring of Earth's terrestrial surface requires mapping estimates of land cover and of their errors in space and time. Estimation of error in land-cover change detection currently relies heavily on external, post hoc validation—i.e., comparison of estimated cover to independent values that are assumed to be true. However, reference data are themselves uncertain, and acquiring observations coincident with historical data is often impossible. Complementarily, modeling the transmission, or propagation, of error through the processes of classification and change detection provides an internal means to estimate classification and change-detection error at the scale of pixels. Modeling uncertainty around the estimate of fractional, “continuous-field” cover as a standard Normal distribution in each pixel at each of two times, we derive a method for propagating this uncertainty to categorical land cover-classification and change detection. We demonstrate the approach for mapping forest-cover change and its uncertainty based on bi-temporal estimates of percent-tree cover and their associated root-mean-square errors (RMSE). The method described here propagates only the imprecision component of error and not bias, so neither the resulting categorical estimates of cover nor the detection of change (e.g., forest loss) are affected by the transmission of uncertainty. However, propagating the RMSE of input estimates into probabilities of forest cover and change enables mapping and visualization of the spatial distribution of the imprecision resulting from model-based estimation of tree cover and from selection of the threshold of tree cover to define “forest”. When compared to reference data with a fixed definition of forest (e.g., ≥30\% tree cover) the threshold effect is an importance source of apparent error in forest-cover and -change estimates. The approach described here provides a useful description of classification and change-detection certainty and can accommodate any definition of forest based on tree cover—an especially important consideration given the variety of institutional definitions of forest cover based on remotely sensible structural characteristics.},

A population density index was used to estimate population densities for each species growing between 1 and 15 m deep. The exponential scale of the index permitted the scoring of population densities from 0.01 to 5,000 plant growing points m−2 based upon an average observation area of 1,000 m2. SCUBA observations as a means of estimating abundance were calibrated by collecting plant shoots with densities corresponding to each point on the scale and determining the number of shoots m−2 for each species present. Direct underwater observations of plant communities covering large areas yielded comprehensive data on species diversity, population density and biomass. The population density index was found to be statistically valid using 95\% confidence limits and prediction intervals. When this index is used in conjunction with the average dry weight of mature shoots for each species, a useful estimation of the mature biomass for each species is possible to within an order of magnitude over a range from 0.01 to 200 g dry weight m−2.},

  abstract = {Forests in the Southwestern United States are becoming increasingly susceptible to large wildfires. As a result, forest managers are conducting forest fuel reduction treatments for which spatial fuels and structure information are necessary. However, this information currently has coarse spatial resolution and variable accuracy. This study tested the feasibility of using unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) imagery to estimate forest canopy fuels and structure in a southwestern ponderosa pine stand. UAV-based multispectral images and Structure-from-Motion point clouds were used to estimate canopy cover, canopy height, tree density, canopy base height, and canopy bulk density. Estimates were validated with field data from 57 plots and aerial photography from the U.S. Department of Agriculture National Agriculture Imaging Program. Results indicate that UAV imagery can be used to accurately estimate forest canopy cover (correlation coefficient (R2) = 0.82, root mean square error (RMSE) = 8.9\%). Tree density estimates correctly detected 74\% of field-mapped trees with a 16\% commission error rate. Individual tree height estimates were strongly correlated with field measurements (R2 = 0.71, RMSE = 1.83 m), whereas canopy base height estimates had a weaker correlation (R2 = 0.34, RMSE = 2.52 m). Estimates of canopy bulk density were not correlated to field measurements. UAV-derived inputs resulted in drastically different estimates of potential crown fire behavior when compared with coarse resolution LANDFIRE data. Methods from this study provide additional data to supplement, or potentially substitute, traditional estimates of canopy fuel.},

First results from testing and field applications of this design underline its suitability for reliable and extended monitoring of how animals interact with the environment. Our empirical results show this design can provide high-resolution data with altitude measurements accurate to the nearest several metres at 1-s intervals, provided a local known elevation pressure reference, elucidating fine-scale differences between species/individuals in their use of the air column over 10-day intervals.},

Hence, it was noteworthy when a field-rat was first caught at Heirisson Prong in 1994, 40 km north-east of the previous location at Shark Bay. Further individuals were caught regularly from late 1995. The population peaked in July–October 2000 (with captures of \textasciitilde 190 individuals per month) and had collapsed by July 2001 (with only the occasional animal caught thereafter). None were caught beyond 2006, despite regular trapping to 2013. This irruption and collapse was beyond the established range of the species and was in atypical habitat. Widespread trapping after the collapse suggested that the population inhabited few localised ‘source’ areas and a broad area of ‘sink’ habitat, with the latter occupied only after extraordinarily high rainfall events leading to higher grass cover. A return to dry years and the consequent loss of cover (aided by an abundant rabbit population) and strong growth in predator numbers (feral cats and small birds of prey) in response to the high number of field-rats appears to have facilitated the collapse.},

Donor and public understanding of the economic factors is becoming increasingly central to the longevity of funding for conservation efforts. Unlike typical economic evaluation, many costs and benefits related to conservation efforts are realised in nonmonetary terms. We identify the types of benefits and costs that arise from conservation projects and examine several well developed techniques that economists use to convert benefits and costs into monetary values so they may be compared in a common metric. Costs are typically more readily identifiable than benefits, with financial project costs reported most frequently, and opportunity and damage costs reported much less often. Most current evaluation methods rely primarily on cost-effectiveness analysis rather than cost-benefit analysis, a result of the difficultly in measuring benefits. We highlight improved methodology to measure secondary costs and benefits on a broader spatial scale, thereby promoting project efficacy and long-term success. Estimation of the secondary effects can provide a means to engage a wider audience in discussions of wildlife conservation by illuminating the relevant impacts to income and employment in local economies.},

  abstract = {Population size and habitat-specific abundance estimates are essential for conservation management. A major impediment to obtaining such estimates is that few statistical models are able to simultaneously account for both spatial variation in abundance and heterogeneity in detection probability, and still be amenable to large-scale applications. The hierarchical distance-sampling model of J. A. Royle, D. K. Dawson, and S. Bates provides a practical solution* Here, we extend this model to estimate habitat-specific abundance and rangewide population size of a bird species of management concern, the Island Scrub-Jay ( Aphelocoma insularis ), which occurs solely on Santa Cruz Island, California, USA. We surveyed 307 randomly selected, 300 m diameter, point locations throughout the 250-km2 island during October 2008 and April 2009. Population size was estimated to be 2267 (95\% CI 1613-3007) and 1705 (1212-2369) during the fall and spring respectively, considerably lower than a previously published but statistically problematic estimate of 12 500. This large discrepancy emphasizes the importance of proper survey design and analysis for obtaining reliable information for management decisions. Jays were most abundant in low-elevation chaparral habitat; the detection function depended primarily on the percent cover of chaparral and forest within count circles. Vegetation change on the island has been dramatic in recent decades, due to release from herbivory following the eradication of feral sheep ( Ovis aries) from the majority of the island in the mid-1980s. We applied best-fit fall and spring models of habitat-specific jay abundance to a vegetation map from 1985, and estimated the population size of A. insularis was 1400-1500 at that time. The 20-30\% increase in the jay population suggests that the species has benefited from the recovery of native vegetation since sheep removal. Nevertheless, this jay's tiny range and small population size make it vulnerable to natural disasters and to habitat alteration related to climate change. Our results demonstrate that hierarchical distance-sampling models hold promise for estimating population size and spatial density variation at large scales. Our statistical methods have been incorporated into the R package unmarked to facilitate their use by animal ecologists, and we provide annotated code in the Supplement.

To compare the efficiency of three methods in detecting species richness and abundance, we tested them in the grasslands of Emas National Park, central Brazil. Track census was the most effective method for detecting richness, followed by camera-trapping and direct faunal counts. Track census reached an asymptote for number of species after only 12 days, but all methods converged on similar estimates of species richness after around 30 days. There was no significant spatial correlation for species richness or total abundance, between camera trap and tracks, across the 29 samples distributed in the park. However, for some species, abundance showed significant spatial correlation between methods. Also, these rates were significantly correlated across species and the spatial correlation between methods was significantly associated with log-transformed body mass across species. We conclude that, despite the high initial costs for camera-trapping, this method is the most appropriate for mammal inventory in all environmental conditions, allowing a rapid assessment of wildlife conservation status.},

  abstract = {The intensity of harvest of wild plants and animals often varies with the distance from human settlements, processing facilities, markets, and transportation routes such as roads and rivers, resulting in marked spatial gradients in the abundance of such resources. Spatial modeling of the harvest of wild species has therefore emerged as an important research approach. The literature on such modeling is, however, fragmented between different resource types, and empirical validation of the models is often weak or absent. This paper presents a model that is intended to have validity for a wide variety of wild plant and animal resources. It combines a logistic model of resource growth with an economic model assuming that costs associated with harvest consist of three components, namely transport, search, and handling, and a one-dimensional spatial structure where resource harvesters are based at a "central place" surrounded by infinite extensions of habitat for the harvested resource. Model outcomes show that the spatial distribution of harvest heavily depends on the carrying capacity and the catchability coefficient, i.e. the ease of finding and harvesting a resource unit. An empirical study of wildlife hunting and palm leaf harvest in indigenous villages in Ecuadorian Amazonia confirmed the validity of model outcomes. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {A successful wildlife management requires monitoring. Including non-scientific volunteers into monitoring actions is a common way for obtaining long-term and comprehensive data. Hunters present a valuable target group as they are spread out nationwide in Germany and additionally, they provide a know-how regarding game species. Since 1990s, various German hunting associations established monitoring programs and motivated hunters to join, in order to record population sizes of huntable game species under standardized census methods. The aim of this study was to compare instructed hunters performed spotlight counts of European brown hares with thermography in three federal states (Lower-Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, North Rhine-Westphalia) in 2015–2018 in Northern Germany. Therefore, we modelled the number of hares counted by both methods with the associated observed area. Moreover, we performed repeated thermographic counts in selected areas and performed distance sampling to test the deviations of estimated population densities within a short time period. Repeated infrared thermographic counts on three consecutive nights show a coefficient of variation from 6.6\% to 15.5\% with deviations of 2.2–2.7 hares per 100 ha, while the method of distance sampling reveals minor deviations of 0.9–1.7 hares per 100 ha and a coefficient of variation from 3.1–7.4\%. The coefficient of variation value between spotlight and infrared thermographic count lies between 0 to 21.4\%. Our model confirmed no significant differences between the European brown hare density estimations based on a spotlight count and an infrared thermographic count on the following night. The results provide insight into the dimension of the error margin of density estimations performed by spotlight counts. Therefore, we recommend to take possible counting errors into account and to ideally perform repeated counts to assess the error margin for each counting site. This would help for example to quantify the uncertainty in the calculation of mortality rates. Additionally, our results show that monitoring data generated by instructed hunters can provide reliable and valid data, if implemented and conducted in a standardized scientific way.},

  abstract = {Gopher tortoise, Gopherus polyphenus. Populations are threatened by habitat loss across their range. Management and conservation of the species has been hidered by the lack of population monitoring data. Recent studies have demonstrated that line transect distance sampling (LTDS) is efficient for estimating population parameters for gopher tortoises, yet this method has not gained wide-spread acceptance. We attempted to use LTDS to survey gopher tortoise populations on 20 protected areas southern Georgia. USA in 2007 and 2008. We used a camera system to determine burrow occupancy at each site. The survey data were used to debsity ranged from 0.21 +/- 0.04 tortoises/ha at Ohoopee Dunes Natural Area to 1.65 +/- 0.37 tortoises/ha at General Coffee State Park. Hence, we reported only the tortoise encounter rate and burrow occupancy estimates for these sites. Population estimates obtained with area-constrained surveys and a 50\% burrow occupancy rate differed by as much as 114\% from those obtained with LTDS and occupancy estimates based on burrow scoping.

  abstract = {Modeling population dynamics while accounting for imperfect detection is essential to monitoring programs. Distance sampling allows estimating population size while accounting for imperfect detection, but existing methods do not allow for estimation of demographic parameters. We develop a model that uses temporal correlation in abundance arising from underlying population dynamics to estimate demographic parameters from repeated distance sampling surveys. Using a simulation study motivated by designing a monitoring program for Island Scrub-Jays (Aphelocoma insularis), we investigated the power of this model to detect population trends. We generated temporally autocorrelated abundance and distance sampling data over six surveys, using population rates of change of 0.95 and 0.90. We fit the data generating Markovian model and a mis-specified model with a log-linear time effect on abundance, and derived post hoc trend estimates from a model estimating abundance for each survey separately. We performed these analyses for varying numbers of survey points. Power to detect population changes was consistently greater under the Markov model than under the alternatives, particularly for reduced numbers of survey points. The model can readily be extended to more complex demographic processes than considered in our simulations. This novel framework can be widely adopted for wildlife population monitoring.

  abstract = {Payments for environmental services (PES) aim to improve the supply of environmental services by making payments to service providers, which are conditional on the provision of those services. Payments cannot be conditional unless the service can be effectively monitored, making monitoring of service provision a central feature of PES. We introduce a framework for designing monitoring programmes in PES schemes for biodiversity conservation. We suggest that decisions must be made concerning the indicators to be used (e.g. species, threats or positive actions), how they will be monitored (e.g. using ground-based or remote-sensed data) and how the monitoring information will be used to differentiate payments (e.g. trends over time, performance relative to neighbouring sites, performance against a target). We then use this framework to examine the feasibility of monitoring species and threat indicators in a community-based biodiversity payment scheme in Menabe, Madagascar. We find that detecting population changes, differences between sites, or whether a target has been met is only feasible for the most common indicators, suggesting that it may not be possible to base payments on the species conservationists are most interested in. If payments need to be based on relatively common indicators, threat indicators may be more appropriate than common species indicators due to a stronger relationship to the service of interest (presence of a rare species). It is, however, possible to incorporate information from rare indicators using accumulation curves to compare between sites. This study highlights the impact of indicator choice on the monitoring effort required in a biodiversity PES. We urge caution in the design of payment schemes and suggest it can be detrimental to structure a scheme around an indicator that cannot be effectively monitored. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Using an information theoretic argument we derive a measure P-D for the effective number of parameters in a model as the difference between the posterior mean of the deviance and the deviance at the posterior means of the parameters of interest. In general P-D approximately corresponds to the trace of the product of Fisher's information and the posterior covariance, which in normal models is the trace of the 'hat' matrix projecting observations onto fitted values. Its properties in exponential families are explored. The posterior mean deviance is suggested as a Bayesian measure of fit or adequacy, and the contributions of individual observations to the fit and complexity can give rise to a diagnostic plot of deviance residuals against leverages. Adding P-D to the posterior mean deviance gives a deviance information criterion for comparing models, which is related to other information criteria and has an approximate decision theoretic justification. The procedure is illustrated in some examples, and comparisons are drawn with alternative Bayesian and classical proposals. Throughout it is emphasized that the quantities required are trivial to compute in a Markov chain Monte Carlo analysis.},

The probability of detecting lynx in mountainous habitats that support resident populations was 0.80-0.99 when surveys were conducted on an 8 3 8 km2 grid with 10 km of search effort per cell. Snow-track surveys were highly successful at detecting the presence of Canada lynx over large landscapes. Two survey replicates established absence of Canada lynx with 95\% certainty.

A common feature is that the results primarily determine the course of further clinical evaluation of a treatment rather than providing de®nitive evidence of treatment ef®cacy. This means that there is more ¯exibility available in the design and analysis of such studies than in phase III trials. This has led to a range of different approaches being taken to the statistical design of stopping rules for such trials. This paper brie¯y describes and compares the different approaches. In most cases the stopping rules can be described and implemented easily without knowledge of the detailed statistical and computational methods used to obtain the rules.},

Common forest inventories are usually carried out at regular time intervals (e.g. every 10 years) and are the basis for management planning. This study investigated the potential of utilizing the data of common forest inventories for simulating the spatial distribution of forest tree locations. Fixed area plot sample data were taken from the University Forest of Pertouli, which is an uneven-aged Abies borisii regis Matf. forest. Using as criterion the index of dispersion, the tree spatial distribution was characterized as aggregated. The Neyman Type A distribution, a typical distribution of aggregated populations, was a good fit to the data, while tree locations simulation was based on the Poisson cluster process. The simulations resulting from the application of fixed area plot sampling do not incorporate information about the real distances between the trees, but they can describe adequately the spatial patterns of their locations in twodimensional space and seem to be useful tools for managers of forest ecosystems. For similar populations the detection of their aggregation seems not to be affected by a considerable decrease of the number (up to 36) and the size (up to 125 m2) of sample fixed-area plots. This method is cost effective and its use, potentially in combination with other methods, could be further investigated for its advantages.},

  abstract = {In response to significant elephant population declines in the 1970s and 1980s because of poaching for ivory, the Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) banned the international trade in Asian and African elephant species by listing them on Appendix I in 1973 and 1989, respectively. Many southern African countries disagreed with the African elephant trade ban and have continued to argue against it since the mid-1980s. They maintain that their governments practise sound wildlife management policies and actions and, as a consequence, their national elephant populations have reached unsustainable size. They argue that they should not be penalized because other countries cannot manage their wildlife. Further, they say they need the proceeds from ivory and other by-product sales to finance conservation efforts. In 1997, the CITES Conference of Parties voted to allow Botswana, Namibia and Zimbabwe to auction off 50 tonnes of government ivory stockpiles to Japanese traders on a one-off experimental basis, which took place in 1999. Ivory trade opponents allege that this sale stimulated ivory demand, resulting in a surge of elephant poaching. Nevertheless, CITES voted again in 2002 to allow Botswana, Namibia and South Africa to auction off another 60 tonnes of ivory after May 2004. Trade opponents have launched an active campaign to prevent the sales, warning that they could provoke a renewed elephant holocaust. This paper reviews available quantitative evidence on ivory trade and elephant killing to evaluate the arguments of the ivory trade proponents and opponents. The evidence supports the view that the trade bans resulted generally in lower levels of ivory market scale and elephant poaching than prevailed prior to 1990. There is little evidence to support claims that the 1999 southern African ivory auctions stimulated ivory demand or elephant poaching. Levels of elephant poaching and illegal ivory trading in a country are more likely to be related to wildlife management practices, law enforcement and corruption than to choice of CITES appendix listings and consequent extent of trade restrictions. Elephant conservation and public welfare can be better served by legal ivory trade than by a trade ban, but until demand for ivory can be restrained and various monitoring and regulation measures are put into place it is premature for CITES to permit ivory sales.},

  abstract = {Gopher tortoises (Gopherus polyphemus) are candidates for range-wide listing as threatened under the U.S. Endangered Species Act. Reliable population estimates are important to inform policy and management for recovery of the species. Line transect distance sampling has been adopted as the preferred method to estimate population size. However, when tortoise density is low, it can be challenging to obtain enough tortoise observations to reliably estimate the probability of detection, a vital component of the method. We suggest a modification to the method based on counting usable tortoise burrows (more abundant than tortoises) and separately accounting for the proportion of burrows occupied by tortoises. The increased sample size of burrows can outweigh the additional uncertainty induced by the need to account for the proportion of burrows occupied. We demonstrate the method using surveys conducted within a 13,118-ha portion of the Gopher Tortoise Habitat Management Unit at Fort Gordon Army Installation, Georgia. We used a systematic random design to obtain more precise estimates, using a newly developed systematic variance estimator. Individual transects had a spatially efficient design (pseudocircuits), which greatly improved sampling efficiency on this large site. Estimated burrow density was 0.091 +/- 0.011 burrows/ha (CV = 12.6\%, 95\% CI = 0.071-0.116), with 25\% of burrows occupied by a tortoise (CV = 14.4\%), yielding a tortoise density of 0.023 +/- 0.004 tortoise/ha (CV = 19.0\%, 95\% CI = 0.016-0.033) and a population estimate of 297 tortoises (95\% CI = 210-433). These techniques are applicable to other studies and species. Surveying burrows or nests, rather than animals, can produce more reliable estimates when it leads to a significantly larger sample of detections and when the occupancy status can reliably be ascertained. Systematic line transect survey designs give better precision and are practical to implement and analyze.},

  abstract = {Wild tigers are in a critical state with an estimated population decline of more than 95\% over the past century. Improving the capacity and effectiveness of law enforcement in reducing poaching of tigers is an immediate priority to secure remaining wild populations in source sites. From 2008-2010, standardized patrol-based law enforcement monitoring (LEM) was established under the Tigers Forever Program across 8 key tiger sites in order to improve and evaluate law enforcement interventions. Patrol-based monitoring has the distinct advantage of providing regular and rapid information on illegal activities and ranger performance, although, until recently, it has received relatively little scrutiny from the conservation community. The present paper outlines a framework for implementation of LEM in tiger source sites using MIST, a computerized management information system for ranger-based data collection. The framework addresses many of the technical, practical and institutional challenges involved in the design, implementation, sustainability and evaluation of LEM. Adoption of such a framework for LEM is a cost-effective strategy to improve the efficiency of law enforcement efforts, to increase the motivation of enforcement staff and to promote the accountability of law enforcement agencies in addressing threats to tigers. When combined with independent, systematic and science-based monitoring of tigers and their prey, LEM has great potential for evaluating the effectiveness of protection-based conservation investments.},

  abstract = {Protected areas are fundamental to biodiversity conservation, but there is growing recognition of the need to extend beyond protected areas to meet the ecological requirements of species at larger scales. Landscape-scale conservation requires an evaluation of management impact on biodiversity under different land-use strategies; this is challenging and there exist few empirical studies. In a conservation landscape in northern Republic of Congo we demonstrate the application of a large-scale monitoring program designed to evaluate the impact of conservation interventions on three globally threatened species: western gorillas, chimpanzees and forest elephants, under three land-use types: integral protection, commercial logging, and community-based natural resource management. We applied distance-sampling methods to examine species abundance across different land-use types under varying degrees of management and human disturbance. We found no clear trends in abundance between land-use types. However, units with interventions designed to reduce poaching and protect habitats - irrespective of land-use type - harboured all three species at consistently higher abundance than a neighbouring logging concession undergoing no wildlife management. We applied Generalized-Additive Models to evaluate a priori predictions of species response to different landscape processes. Our results indicate that, given adequate protection from poaching, elephants and gorillas can profit from herbaceous vegetation in recently logged forests and maintain access to ecologically important resources located outside of protected areas. However, proximity to the single integrally protected area in the landscape maintained an overriding positive influence on elephant abundance, and logging roads – even subject to anti-poaching controls - were exploited by elephant poachers and had a major negative influence on elephant distribution. Chimpanzees show a clear preference for unlogged or more mature forests and human disturbance had a negative influence on chimpanzee abundance, in spite of anti-poaching interventions. We caution against the pitfalls of missing and confounded co-variables in model-based estimation approaches and highlight the importance of spatial scale in the response of different species to landscape processes.

  abstract = {This book begins with a review of basic results in optimal search for a stationary target. It then develops the theory of optimal search for a moving target, providing algorithms for computing optimal plans and examples of their use. Next it develops methods for computing optimal search plans involving multiple targets and multiple searchers with realistic operational constraints on search movement. These results assume that the target does not react to the search. In the final chapter there is a brief overview of mostly military problems where the target tries to avoid being found as well as rescue or rendezvous problems where the target and the searcher cooperate.~ Larry Stone wrote his definitive book Theory of Optimal Search~in 1975, dealing almost exclusively with the stationary target search problem. Since then the theory has advanced to encompass search for targets that move even as the search proceeds, and computers have developed sufficient capability to employ the improved theory. In this book, Stone joins Royset and Washburn to document and explain this expanded theory of search. The problem of how to search for moving targets arises every day in military, rescue, law enforcement, and border patrol operations.},

We validated retrievals with ground-truth data collected from two sites near Tumbarumba, New South Wales, Australia. In a ponderosa pine plantation, LAI values of 1.84 and 2.18 retrieved by two different methods using a single EVI scan bracketed a value of 1.98 estimated by allometric equations. In a natural, but managed, Eucalypus stand, eight scans provided mean LAI values of 2.28–2.47, depending on the method, which compare favorably with a value of 2.4 from hemispherical photography. The retrieved foliage profile clearly showed two canopy layers. A “find-trunks” algorithm processed the EVI scans at both sites to identify stems, determine their diameters, and measure their distances from the scan center. Distances were retrieved very accurately (r2 = 0.99). The accuracy of EVI diameter retrieval decreased somewhat with distance as a function of angular resolution of the instrument but remained unbiased. We estimated stand basal area, mean diameter, and stem count density using the Relaskop method of variable radius plot sampling and found agreement with manual Relaskop values within about 2\% after correcting for the obscuring of far trunks by near trunks (occlusion). These early trials prove the potential of under-canopy, upward-scanning lidar to retrieve forest structural parameters quickly and accurately.},

  abstract = {Problems and correlates of success in the conservation of Africa's rain forests were evaluated for 16 protected areas in 11 countries, representing approximately half of all protected areas in this biome. Data were obtained from questionnaires, published and unpublished accounts, and direct observations. Despite numerous problems, all protected areas conserved indigenous rain forest biodiversity more effectively than did alternative land uses. More than half the protected areas suffered extensive ecological isolation. Effective management of protected areas was seriously compromised by inadequate funding and government support. Dense human populations, often resulting from immigration, constituted major threats to, protected areas. Perceived conservation success was greatest for large protected areas surrounded by similar habitat with strong public support, effective law enforcement, low human population densities, and substantial support from international donors. Contrary to expectations, protected area success was not directly correlated with employment benefits for the neighboring community, conservation education, conservation clubs, or with the presence and extent of integrated conservation and development programs. Studies are needed to better understand what shapes positive pubic attitude towards protected areas because none of the conventional public outreach programs were correlated with public attitude. We also identify apparent deficiencies in foreign assistance to these protected areas. The single most important short-term strategy was considered to be the improvement of law enforcement effectiveness through greater technical and financial support. Nine medium-term strategies are identified, including provision of adequate and secure long-term funding, establishing research and monitoring programs, and developing more appropriate conservation and development programs. Long-term strategies deal with two ultimate causal factors, mainly attitudes and value systems, and stabilizing human populations. Future success of Africa's protected areas is contingent upon long-term international assistance including contingencies mandating realistic performance standards. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {Stem diameter at breast height (DBH) and tree height (H) are commonly used measures of tree growth. We examined patterns of height growth and diameter growth along a stem using a 20-year record of an even-aged hinoki cypress (Chamaecyparis obtusa (Siebold \& Zucc.) Endl.) stand. In the region of the stem below the crown (except for the butt swell), diameter growth rates (ΔD) at different heights tended to increase slightly from breast height upwards. This increasing trend was pronounced in suppressed trees, but not as much as the variation in ΔD among individual trees. Hence, ΔD below the crown can be regarded as generally being represented by the DBH growth rate (ΔDBH) of a tree. Accordingly, the growth rate of the stem cross-sectional area increased along the stem upwards in suppressed trees, but decreased in dominant trees. The stem diameter just below the crown base (DCB), the square of which is an index of the amount of leaves on a tree, was an important factor affecting ΔDBH. DCB also had a strong positive relationship with crown length. Hence, long-term changes in the DCB of a tree were associated with long-term changes in crown length, determined by the balance between the height growth rate (ΔH) and the rising rate of the crown base (ΔHCB). Within the crown, ΔD's were generally greater than the rates below the crown. Even dying trees (ΔD\,≈\,0 below the crown) maintained ΔD\,{$>$}\,0 within the crown and ΔH\,{$>$}\,0 until about 5 years before death. This growth within the crown may be related to the need to produce new leaves to compensate for leaves lost owing to the longevity of the lower crown. These results explain the different time trajectories in DBH–H relationships among individual trees, and also the long-term changes in the DBH–H relationships. The view that a rise in the crown base is strongly related to leaf turnover helps to interpret DBH–H relationships.},

  abstract = {This study evaluates information produced from 14 fisheries independent monitoring programs (FIM) in the Gulf of Mexico. We consider the uniqueness of information from each program and its usefulness in estimating fisheries management indices. Biomass values of 35 functional groups are extracted from an operating model (Ecospace) with a method that replicates the patterns of historic FIM samplings. Observation error is added to these data in order to create a set of pseudo data that replicate the type and quality of information obtained from FIM programs. The pseudo data were put into a separate fishery assessment model (Pella-Tomlinson) to determine management indices of each functional group (maximum sustainable yield (MSY), biomass at MSY, and fishing mortality at MSY). These indices are compared against values in Ecospace, and against previously published single-species stock assessments. We also evaluate the full suite of information derived from FIM within an ecosystem context, considering whether functional roles are over- or under-sampled, and whether sampling effort is proportional to the value of fish stocks. Results reveal that model derived fishery indices closely matched published indices for the majority of the functional groups, economic and ecological evaluation suggests that several piscivorous functional groups are under-sampled include forage base species that are likely to indirectly support fisheries for piscivores, and sampling efforts are not proportional to the value of some fish stocks. Following ecological modelling we performed statistical analyses on historic FIM catch data to identify optimal species-specific sampling months and gear-types that can be used to refine future FIM sampling efforts.}

  abstract = {The conservation of gray wolf (Canis lupus) and its coexistence with humans presents a challenge and requires continuous monitoring and management efforts. One of the noninvasive methods that produces high-quality wolf monitoring datasets is camera trapping. We present a novel monitoring approach where camera traps are positioned on wildlife crossing structures that channel the animals, thereby increasing trapping success and increasing the cost-efficiency of the method. In this way we have followed abundance trends of five wolf packs whose home ranges are intersected by a motorway which spans throughout the wolf distribution range in Croatia. During the five-year monitoring of six green bridges we have recorded 28 250 camera-events, 132 with wolves. Four viaducts were monitored for two years, recording 4914 camera-events, 185 with wolves. We have detected a negative abundance trend of the monitored Croatian wolf packs since 2011, especially severe in the northern part of the study area. Further, we have pinpointed the legal cull as probable major negative influence on the wolf pack abundance trends (linear regression, r(2) {$>$} 0.75, P {$<$} 0.05). Using the same approach we did not find evidence for a negative impact of wolves on the prey populations, both wild ungulates and livestock. We encourage strict protection of wolf in Croatia until there is more data proving population stability. In conclusion, quantitative methods, such as the one presented here, should be used as much as possible when assessing wolf abundance trends.},

During 2000, 34 I-km transects were each sampled twice in the 368.5-ha study area. We observed 46 tortoises with midline carapace lengths greater than or equal to 150 mm (subadults and adults) plus 7 juveniles on transects. For subadults and adults, the encounter rate was 0.63 tortoises/km, and the mean proportion of tortoises observable during radiotelemetry, conducted concurrently with transect sampling, was 82\%. Corrected mean density based on line transects and radiotelemetry was 0.523 tortoises/ha (CV = 22.99, 95\% CI = 0.29-0.79), and absolute abundance in the study area was estimated to be 193 (CV = 23.0\%, CI = 107-291). Using the 2 independent coverages of transects as separate samples, the Lincoln-Petersen mark-recapture estimator produced an abundance estimate of 224 subadult and adult tortoises (CV = 53.9\%, CI = 72-440). Transects measured on the ground over uneven topography resulted in 3\% smaller estimates of density when compared to analysis with transect lengths determined from coordinates plotted on a map. Distance sampling appears to be a feasible method of estimating density of Sonoran Desert populations of the desert tortoise, but transect lengths should be based on mapped rather than measured distances to prevent biases caused by uneven topography.},

Camera trap placement design is likely to influence these parameter estimates.

Both setups recorded 25 species when same number of trail and random cameras (n = 31) were compared. However, species accumulation rate was faster with trail cameras. Relative abundance indices (RAI) from random cameras surrogated abundance estimated from capture-mark-recapture and distance sampling, while RAI were biased higher for carnivores from trail cameras. Group size of wild-ungulates obtained from both camera setups were comparable. Random cameras detected nocturnal activities of wild ungulates in contrast to mostly diurnal activities observed from trail cameras. Our results show that trail and random camera setup give similar estimates of species richness and group size, but differ for estimates of relative abundance and activity patterns. Therefore, inferences made from each of these camera trap designs on the above parameters need to be viewed within this context.},

  abstract = {Patterns that resemble strongly skewed size distributions are frequently observed in ecology. A typical example represents tree size distributions of stem diameters. Empirical tests of ecological theories predicting their parameters have been conducted, but the results are difficult to interpret because the statistical methods that are applied to fit such decaying size distributions vary. In addition, binning of field data as well as measurement errors might potentially bias parameter estimates. Here, we compare three different methods for parameter estimation – the common maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) and two modified types of MLE correcting for binning of observations or random measurement errors. We test whether three typical frequency distributions, namely the power-law, negative exponential and Weibull distribution can be precisely identified, and how parameter estimates are biased when observations are additionally either binned or contain measurement error. We show that uncorrected MLE already loses the ability to discern functional form and parameters at relatively small levels of uncertainties. The modified MLE methods that consider such uncertainties (either binning or measurement error) are comparatively much more robust. We conclude that it is important to reduce binning of observations, if possible, and to quantify observation accuracy in empirical studies for fitting strongly skewed size distributions. In general, modified MLE methods that correct binning or measurement errors can be applied to ensure reliable results.},

  abstract = {Background Effective management depends upon accurately estimating trends in abundance of bird populations over time, and in some cases estimating abundance. Two population estimation methods, double observer (DO) and double sampling (DS), have been advocated for avian population studies and the relative merits and short-comings of these methods remain an area of debate. Methodology/Principal Findings We used simulations to evaluate the performances of these two population estimation methods under a range of realistic scenarios. For three hypothetical populations with different levels of clustering, we generated DO and DS population size estimates for a range of detection probabilities and survey proportions. Population estimates for both methods were centered on the true population size for all levels of population clustering and survey proportions when detection probabilities were greater than 20\%. The DO method underestimated the population at detection probabilities less than 30\% whereas the DS method remained essentially unbiased. The coverage probability of 95\% confidence intervals for population estimates was slightly less than the nominal level for the DS method but was substantially below the nominal level for the DO method at high detection probabilities. Differences in observer detection probabilities did not affect the accuracy and precision of population estimates of the DO method. Population estimates for the DS method remained unbiased as the proportion of units intensively surveyed changed, but the variance of the estimates decreased with increasing proportion intensively surveyed. Conclusions/Significance The DO and DS methods can be applied in many different settings and our evaluations provide important information on the performance of these two methods that can assist researchers in selecting the method most appropriate for their particular needs.},

  abstract = {Unsustainable hunting threatens both biodiversity and local livelihoods. Despite high levels of research effort focused on understanding the dynamics of bushmeat trade and consumption, current research is largely site specific. Without synthesis and quantitative analysis of available case studies, the national and regional characteristics of bushmeat trade and consumption remain largely speculative, impeding efforts to inform national and regional policy on bushmeat trade. Here we describe the structure and content of the West and Central African bushmeat database which holds quantitative data on bushmeat sales, consumption and offtake for 177 species from 275 sites across 11 countries in two regions, spanning three decades of research. Despite this wealth of available data, we found important biases in research effort. The majority of studies in West and Central Africa have collected market data, which although providing a useful record of bushmeat sales, are limited in their ability to track changes in hunting offtake. In addition, few data exist for West Africa, and few studies have tracked changes over time, using repeat sampling.

  abstract = {Two measuring devices are available to classify units into one of two mutually exclusive categories. The first device is an expensive procedure which classifies units correctly; the second device is a cheaper procedure which tends to misclassify units. To estimate p, the proportion of units which belong to one of the categories, a double sampling scheme is presented. At the first stage, a sample of N units is taken and the fallible classifications are obtained; at the second stage a subsample of n units is drawn from the main sample and the true classifications are obtained. The maximum likelihood estimate of p is derived along with its asymptotic variance. Optimum values of n and N which minimize the measurement costs for a fixed variance of estimation and which minimize the precision for fixed cost are derived. This double sampling scheme is compared to the binomial sampling scheme in which only true measurements are obtained.}

  abstract = {Artificial coastal reefs were initially installed off Reunion Island (SW Indian Ocean) in order to attract and catch small pelagic fish of economic importance for the local fishery. These artificial reefs also attract a high density of juvenile coral reef fish, especially after recruitment. Because of high species richness and density, a suitable method of evaluating diversity and abundance in such assemblages is needed. An experiment was conducted in situ for 1 year in order to test which of the two visual techniques, slate or video recording, would be the most suitable for sampling artificial reefs. For the quantitative study, a rope framework (four belt transects each measuring 24×3 m) was used to ease the movement of the divers. To avoid bias due to time variations, the study was conducted under limited time in situ. The advantages and disadvantages of the two techniques regarding the accuracy of qualitative and quantitative results are discussed. The qualitative study results show that the slate technique is the most accurate one for determining species richness. In the quantitative study, factors such as species characteristics (ecological type), attractiveness (relationship between fish and diver) and abundance of fish communities around the artificial reefs appear to influence our results on the comparison of the two techniques. Of 13 ‘permanent’ (observed in more than 75\% of dives) species, 6 returned a similar frequency of detection by slate and video (Lutjanus kasmira, Lutjanus bengalensis, Priacanthus hamrur, Chaetodon kleinii, Heniochus diphreutes, Mulloides vanicolensis); these were then selected for comparison of the techniques using quantitative data. The correlation between video and slate census results is high, but, in comparison with the slate census, the video census underestimates abundance, especially for low values. A corrected index is proposed to remedy this underestimation; it could be used for video surveys conducted on species responding well to video detection (as below).},

The biological system is described by a state-space model, where the true but unknown state of the population is modelled by a state process, and this is linked to survey data by an observation process. All sources of uncertainty in the inputs, including uncertainty about model specification, are readily incorporated. The paper shows how the state process can be represented as a generalization of the standard Leslie or Lefkovitch matrix. By dividing the state process into subprocesses, complex models can be constructed from manageable building blocks. The paper illustrates the approach with a model of the British grey seal metapopulation, using sequential importance sampling with kernel smoothing to fit the model.},

  abstract = {Monitoring natural resources in Alaskan national parks is challenging because of their remoteness, limited accessibility, and high sampling costs. We describe an iterative, three-phased process for developing sampling designs based on our efforts to establish a vegetation monitoring program in southwest Alaska. In the first phase, we defined a sampling frame based on land ownership and specific vegetated habitats within the park boundaries and used Path Distance analysis tools to create a GIS layer that delineated portions of each park that could be feasibly accessed for ground sampling. In the second phase, we used simulations based on landcover maps to identify size and configuration of the ground sampling units (single plots or grids of plots) and to refine areas to be potentially sampled. In the third phase, we used a second set of simulations to estimate sample size and sampling frequency required to have a reasonable chance of detecting a minimum trend in vegetation cover for a specified time period and level of statistical confidence. Results of the first set of simulations indicated that a spatially balanced random sample of single plots from the most common landcover types yielded the most efficient sampling scheme. Results of the second set of simulations were compared with field data and indicated that we should be able to detect at least a 25\% change in vegetation attributes over 31 years by sampling 8 or more plots per year every five years in focal landcover types. This approach would be especially useful in situations where ground sampling is restricted by access. Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract = {There is an urgent need for information on western gorilla population sizes and distribution to improve present and plan future conservation actions. Researchers traditionally have estimated gorilla densities on the basis of nest counts despite demonstrated variation in nest production and decay rates. The variation may lead to large biases in estimates of gorilla abundance. We investigated the use of an alternate index of gorilla abundance, via defecation data collected from habituated gorillas at Bai Hokou, Central African Republic. Our sample of 274/370 defecation events/dung piles produced a production rate of ca. 5 dung piles/d: comparable to previous estimates based on much smaller sample sizes. Heuristic models that failed to account for imperfect dung pile detection produced a lower defecation rate estimate than that of a maximum likelihood model that explicitly modeled detection probability. Generalized linear modeling (GLM) showed that dung pile production rate was strongly linked to rainfall, suggesting that failure to correct for seasonal variation in dung pile production rates could lead to substantial biases in gorilla abundance estimates. In our study, failing to distinguish between the number of defecation events and the number of dung piles produced would lead to a ca. 31\% overestimate of true gorilla numbers. The use of dung as an index of gorilla abundance shows potential, but more fieldwork and modeling on seasonal variation in dung production rates is required.},

Our hair snare was successful in collecting hair from 316 squirrels of 3 species with 99.4\% single captures and only 1 permanent capture. Using morphological analysis, we differentiated among northern flying squirrels, southern flying squirrels (G. volans), and red squirrels (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus) using 8 morphological measurements and an orthogonal discriminant function analysis to successfully refine and confirm identification of the hair. We advocate the use of this relatively noninvasive and inexpensive protocol for studying other sensitive wildlife species. (C) 2017 The Wildlife Society.},

  abstract = {Starting in the 1970s, many populations of large-bodied mammalian carnivores began to recover from centuries of human-caused eradication and habitat destruction. The recovery of several such populations has since slowed or reversed due to mortality caused by humans. Illegal killing (poaching) is a primary cause of death in many carnivore populations. Law enforcement agencies face difficulties in preventing poaching and scientists face challenges in measuring it. Both challenges are exacerbated when evidence is concealed or ignored. We present data on deaths of 937 Wisconsin gray wolves (Canis lupus) from October 1979 to April 2012 during a period in which wolves were recolonizing historic range mainly under federal government protection. We found and partially remedied sampling and measurement biases in the source data by reexamining necropsy reports and reconstructing the numbers and causes of some wolf deaths that were never reported. From 431 deaths and disappearances of radiocollared wolves aged {$>$} 7.5 months, we estimated human causes accounted for two-thirds of reported and reconstructed deaths, including poaching in 39-45\%, vehicle collisions in 13\%, legal killing by state agents in 6\%, and nonhuman causes in 36-42\%. Our estimate of poaching remained an underestimate because of persistent sources of uncertainty and systematic underreporting. Unreported deaths accounted for over two-thirds of all mortality annually among wolves {$>$} 7.5 months old. One-half of all poached wolves went unreported, or {$>$} 80\% of poached wolves not being monitored by radiotelemetry went unreported. The annual mortality rate averaged 18\% +/- 10\% for monitored wolves but 47\% +/- 19\% for unmonitored wolves. That difference appeared to be due largely to radiocollaring being concentrated in the core areas of wolf range, as well as higher rates of human-caused mortality in the periphery of wolf range. We detected an average 4\% decline in wolf population growth in the last 5 years of the study. Because our estimates of poaching risk and overall mortality rate exceeded official estimates after 2012, we present all data for transparency and replication. More recent additions of public hunting quotas after 2012 appear unsustainable without effective curtailment of poaching. Effective antipoaching enforcement will require more accurate estimates of poaching rate, location, and timing than currently available. Independent scientific review of methods and data will improve antipoaching policies for large carnivore conservation, especially for controversial species facing high levels of human-induced mortality.},

The majority of survey observations occurred in the central and northern part of Saipan Lagoon, which correlated with capture locations documented in the commercial fishery landings. Analysis of contemporary and historical commercial fishery data showed that HHW could not be considered primary fishery target species. Distance sampling results indicated that coral/hard bottom and Enhalus acroroides seagrass were the habitats most important to HHW, as reflected by higher density estimates. The use of distance sampling was useful in estimating the spatial distribution and density of HHW, and should be considered when assessing other rare marine finfish species.},

  abstract = {With increasing human pressures on wildlife comes a responsibility to monitor them effectively, particularly in an environment of declining research funds. Scarce funding resources compromise the level and efficacy of monitoring possible to detect trends in abundance, highlighting the priority for developing cost-effective programs. A systematic and rigorous sampling regime was developed to estimate abundance of a small, genetically isolated spinner dolphin (Stenella longirostris) population exposed to high levels of human activities. Five monitoring scenarios to detect trends in abundance were evaluated by varying sampling effort, precision, power, and sampling interval. Scenario 1 consisted of monthly surveys, each of 12days, used to obtain the initial two consecutive annual abundance estimates. Scenarios 2, 3, and 4 consisted of a reduced effort, while Scenario 5 doubled the effort of Scenario 1. Scenarios with the greatest effort (1 and 5) produced the most precise abundance estimates (CV=0.09). Using a CV=0.09 and power of 80\%, it would take 9years to detect a 5\% annual change in abundance compared with 12years at a power of 95\%. Under this best-case monitoring scenario, if the trend was a decline, the population would have decreased by 37\% and 46\%, respectively, prior to detection of a significant decline. With the potential of a large decline in a small population prior to detection, the lower power level should be used to trigger a management intervention. The approach presented here is applicable across taxa for which individuals can be identified, including terrestrial and aquatic mammals, birds, and reptiles.},

The multidirectional accuracy and quality of the laser measurement set-ups (lateral sideway, lateral bottom-up, hemispherical bottom-up) subsequently were compared based on the development of a mathematical description of each case. Vertical plant profiles were computed for the different experimental set-ups showing the direct influence of the vertical distribution pattern of the laser beams on the estimation of plant material in a certain height bin. The main measurement direction proved to have the biggest impact on the quality of the dataset, since the derived vertical profile followed the main trend of this laser beam distribution pattern. The use of probabilitybased statistics was necessary to correct the vertical profiles in order to obtain an acceptable estimation of the amount of plant material per height bin of 0.05 m.},

  abstract = {Objectives: Clinical trials in neurodegenerative disorders are facing high futility rates and rising development costs. We aim to review and exemplify the value of group sequential trial designs (i.e., designs with one or more prospectively planned interim analyses) within the field of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Study Design and Setting: We reviewed the literature to identify sequentially conducted trials. Subsequently, we reanalyzed the dexpramipexole trial (EMPOWER), a classically designed and conducted trial involving 942 participants, by sequentially monitoring the functional questionnaire and survival endpoint. Finally, we simulated the performance of the sequential methodology under different treatment effects. Results: Only six (12\%) randomized, placebo-controlled trials incorporated stopping rules for both futility and superiority. Despite its high enrollment rate, sequential reanalysis of the EMPOWER study reduced the total trial duration with 140 days (23.4\%, 95\% confidence interval [CI] 13.2e34.4\%), the number of follow-ups with 2,688 visits (23.6\%, 95\% CI 11.3e38.6\%), and the total drug exposure time with 73,377 days (20.6\%, 95\% CI 9.8e35.9\%). The functional questionnaire considerably increased the heterogeneity in the test statistics, which may negatively affect sequential monitoring. Conclusion: Group sequential trials can result in important reductions in the trial duration, which could make clinical trials more ethical by reducing the patients’ exposure to noneffective treatments or by limiting their time on placebo.

  abstract = {Numerous indicator approaches are found in the scientific literature to describe changes in biodiversity. It is however far from clear which indicators are most appropriate and which are less suitable to summarize trends in biodiversity. One reason for this lack of clarity is that so far the mathematical properties of indicator approaches have had little attention. In this paper, we derive a number of desirable mathematical properties of indicators from economic price-index theory and apply these in the form of tests to W metrics to summarize changes in biodiversity. The metrics species richness, Simpson index, Shannon index, Buckland's modified Shannon index and Sorensen's similarity coefficient violate the monotonicity and proportionality test. The percentage of increasing minus declining species also fails the proportionality test, and in the case where trends are assessed relative to the preceding year, this metric also violates the identity test. Most of these indicators are sensitive to spatial scale. The arithmetic and geometric mean of population indices and the mean abundance have better mathematical performance, but the first two are sensitive to appearing and disappearing species in the system surveyed. The metric mean abundance however can only be applied under particular conditions and has some undesirable properties. Unlike the arithmetic mean, the geometric mean is not sensitive to the base year chosen and has the most favourable mathematical properties of the indicators evaluated. The geometric mean can be straightforwardly extended to take into account unequal values of species if desired. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

These networks enable the capture of data perceived as necessary to evidence conservation strategies and foster public support. We collected interview and archival data from UK-based conservation organisations with regard to their use of digital technologies for wildlife monitoring. As a conceptual device to examine these efforts, we used Benedict Anderson's (1991) work on censuses, maps and museums as social instruments that enabled the imagining of communities. Through a critical application of this framework, the technologically-aided acquisition of wildlife data was shown to inform the new ways in which conservation organisations identify and quantify wildlife, conceptualise animal spaces, and curate conservation narratives. In so defining, delineating and displaying the non-human animal world with the backing of organisational authority, new technologies aid in the representational construction of animal censuses, maps and museums. In terms of practice, large amounts of new data can now be gathered and processed more cost-effectively. However, the use of technologies may also be the result of pressures on organisations to legitimise conservation by being seen as innovative and popular. Either way, human participants are relegated to supporting rather than participatory roles. At a more abstract level, the scale of surveillance associated with instrumentation can be read as an exercise of human dominance. Nonetheless, new technologies present conservation organisations with the means necessary for defending wildlife against exploitation. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Gabon and the Republic of Congo alone are thought to hold roughly 80\% of the world's gorillas(2) and most of the common chimpanzees(1). Here we present survey results conservatively indicating that ape populations in Gabon declined by more than half between 1983 and 2000. The primary cause of the decline in ape numbers during this period was commercial hunting, facilitated by the rapid expansion of mechanized logging. Furthermore, Ebola haemorrhagic fever is currently spreading through ape populations in Gabon and Congo and now rivals hunting as a threat to apes. Gorillas and common chimpanzees should be elevated immediately to `critically endangered' status. Without aggressive investments in law enforcement, protected area management and Ebola prevention, the next decade will see our closest relatives pushed to the brink of extinction.}

  abstract = {1. A key element of African elephant conservation is monitoring how different forms of human activity influence elephant distribution and abundance. Information on human-elephant interaction is critical for guiding conservation action at all levels, from very local management interventions, through national protected area planning, to international policy initiatives such as the ban on ivory trade. However, methods for monitoring elephant numbers often produce rather poor estimate precision. Therefore, a major challenge for elephant monitoring programmes at all levels is to allocate survey effort efficiently: the greatest possible statistical power to detect the effects of particular forms of human activity must be obtained from limited survey effort. 2. This study examined an approach to survey design based on the assumption that the precision of an abundance estimate is directly proportional to sampling effort. Field data from three sites in Central Africa were used to evaluate the potential of this approach for projecting how much effort will be necessary to survey and monitor forest elephants. 3. Variance in elephant dung pile encounter rate was proportional to sampling effort, but variance was also influenced by mean encounter rate. The relationship between variance and mean encounter rate followed a power law more closely than the linear model suggested by many previous authors. The linear model tended to substantially underestimate the effort level required for areas with high encounter rates. A bootstrapping exercise suggested that modelling the precision-effort relationship across strata should produce more accurate projections than estimating a distinct precision-effort relationship for each stratum. 4. Our results suggest that the survey design framework examined could substantially improve the statistical power of forest elephant monitoring programmes, although the use of a power law (rather than linear) model seems preferable. A similar approach should be appropriate for designing savanna elephant monitoring programmes and for addressing other issues, including rates of hunting and human elephant conflict. Furthermore, the parameter estimates reported in this study should be useful in designing elephant survey and monitoring programmes at other forested sites in Central Africa.},

  abstract = {The decision by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) to condition a limited sale of ivory on the status of elephant poaching has brought into sharp focus the technical, organizational, and financial challenges inherent in setting up a continent-wide monitoring program. The task will be particularly arduous in central Africa, where forest elephant populations are difficult to monitor and the infrastructure necessary for population monitoring is lacking. The magnitude of effort that will be necessary is illustrated by an elephant survey done in the Gamba Complex, a network of protected areas on the southwest coast of Gabon. Implementing the survey required a large-scale program for training Gabonese nationals in field survey and analysis methods necessary for elephant monitoring. Field work carried out during the training program suggests that a combination of reconnaissance and line transects can product statistically valid population estimates for a substantially lower effort than line transects alone. We illustrate statistical frameworks for comparing the efficiency of alternative sampling methods, and we analyze the sensitivity of current survey methods, which can detect abundance changes on the order of 15\% given fairly high effort levels. Although these training and methodological results are encouraging, they are just small steps in a complex and ongoing process. We argue that this process has many parallels with what needs to be done if the international conservation community is to respond to the challenge set for it by the 1997 CITES meeting. There must be a concerted effort focused both on improving survey methods and on developing the human resources and on-the-ground infrastructure necessary to implement these methods.},

  abstract = {Game reserves (GR) in Tanzania have been found to support similar or lower densities of large mammals compared with National parks (NP). But as these areas usually differ considerably not only in regard to management but also to environmental factors, we assessed the relative importance of vegetation cover, species-specific habitat preferences and legal (trophy hunting) and illegal off-take for observed differences in species-specific densities. In the Katavi ecosystem, open habitats were characteristic elements of Katavi NP, while Rukwa GR was dominated by miombo forest. In an inter-specific comparison, density differences were moderately correlated with preferences for open habitats, and with estimates of combined legal and illegal off-take but not with one of these separately. In a multiple linear regression, open habitat preference was found to explain 39.6\% of the density differences between the two protected areas. This analysis suggests that the broad-scale pattern of most species' distributions is governed by differing vegetation cover but that several species are overexploited by illegal (elephant, giraffe, buffalo, bush pig, warthog) or combined off-take (hippopotamus, eland, waterbuck), thus emphasizing the need for quota readjustments and a more efficient anti-poaching control.},

  abstract = {Background:\hspace{0.6em} Plant height is an important morphological and developmental phenotype that directly indicates overall plant growth and is widely predictive of final grain yield and biomass. Currently, manually measuring plant height is laborious and has become a bottleneck for genetics and breeding programs. The goal of this research was to evaluate the performance of five different sensing technologies for field-based high throughput plant phenotyping (HTPP) of sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench] height. With this purpose, (1) an ultrasonic sensor, (2) a LIDAR-Lite v2 sensor, (3) a Kinect v2 camera, (4) an imaging array of four high-resolution cameras were evaluated on a ground vehicle platform, and (5) a digital camera was evaluated on an unmanned aerial vehicle platform to obtain the performance baselines to measure the plant height in the field. Plot-level height was extracted by averaging different percentiles of elevation observations within each plot. Measurements were taken on 80 single-row plots of a US\,×\,Chinese sorghum recombinant inbred line population. The performance of each sensing technology was also qualitatively evaluated through comparison of device cost, measurement resolution, and ease and efficiency of data analysis. Results:\hspace{0.6em} We found the heights measured by the ultrasonic sensor, the LIDAR-Lite v2 sensor, the Kinect v2 camera, and the imaging array had high correlation with the manual measurements (r\,≥\,0.90), while the heights measured by remote imaging had good, but relatively lower correlation to the manual measurements (r\,=\,0.73). Conclusion:\hspace{0.6em} These results confirmed the ability of the proposed methodologies for accurate and efficient HTPP of plant height and can be extended to a range of crops. The evaluation approach discussed here can guide the fieldbased HTPP research in general.},

  abstract = {Global changes are driving ecosystem alterations, and the effects are becoming more and more obvious. Ecosystem management clarifies the fundamental supporting functions of ecosystems for human survival and sustainable development. Integrated ecosystem monitoring and assessment has become a popular topic of ecology study. However, many scientific questions need to be addressed, including what assessment contents and methods are optimal for temporal and spatial measurements. Therefore, the development of a scientific evaluation framework that includes certain core contents and indicators is very important. This paper proposes a regional integrated ecosystem assessment framework involving comprehensive monitoring. Satellite images are the main data source for different ecosystem and ecological parameters, and these need to be supplemented with the help of surveys or field observation data. A healthy ecosystem is the basis of human survival and sustainable development, and ecological service should be taken as the core of integrated ecosystem assessment. This is decided by the spatial distribution, classification, and patterns of regional ecosystems. That is to say, ecological service, together with ecosystems distribution and pattern, ecological problem indicators, and ecological stress, needs to be integrated analyzed and evaluated.}

  abstract = {Background Increasingly, underwater visual censuses (UVC) are used to assess fish populations. Several studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of protected areas for increasing fish abundance or provided insight into the natural abundance and structure of reef fish communities in remote areas. Recently, high apex predator densities ({$>$}100,000 individuals·km−2) and biomasses ({$>$}4 tonnes·ha−1) have been reported for some remote islands suggesting the occurrence of inverted trophic biomass pyramids. However, few studies have critically evaluated the methods used for sampling conspicuous and highly mobile fish such as sharks. Ideally, UVC are done instantaneously, however, researchers often count animals that enter the survey area after the survey has started, thus performing non-instantaneous UVC. Methodology/Principal Findings We developed a simulation model to evaluate counts obtained by divers deploying non-instantaneous belt-transect and stationary-point-count techniques. We assessed how fish speed and survey procedure (visibility, diver speed, survey time and dimensions) affect observed fish counts. Results indicate that the bias caused by fish speed alone is huge, while survey procedures had varying effects. Because the fastest fishes tend to be the largest, the bias would have significant implications on their biomass contribution. Therefore, caution is needed when describing abundance, biomass, and community structure based on non-instantaneous UVC, especially for highly mobile species such as sharks. Conclusions/Significance Based on our results, we urge that published literature state explicitly whether instantaneous counts were made and that survey procedures be accounted for when non-instantaneous counts are used. Using published density and biomass values of communities that include sharks we explore the effect of this bias and suggest that further investigation may be needed to determine pristine shark abundances and the existence of inverted biomass pyramids. Because such studies are used to make important management and conservation decisions, incorrect estimates of animal abundance and biomass have serious and significant implications.},

  abstract = {Fire is both a widespread natural disturbance that affects the distribution of species and a tool that can be used to manage habitats for species. Knowledge of temporal changes in the occurrence of species after fire is essential for conservation management in fireprone environments. Two key issues are: whether postfire responses of species are idiosyncratic or if multiple species show a limited number of similar responses; and whether such responses to time since fire can predict the occurrence of species across broad spatial scales. We examined the response of bird species to time since fire in semiarid shrubland in southeastern Australia using data from surveys at 499 sites representing a 100-year chronosequence. We used nonlinear regression to model the probability of occurrence of 30 species with time since fire in two vegetation types, and compared species’ responses with generalized response shapes from the literature. The occurrence of 16 species was significantly influenced by time since fire: they displayed six main responses consistent with generalized response shapes. Of these 16 species, 15 occurred more frequently in mid- or later-successional vegetation (.20 years since fire), and only one species occurred more often in early succession (,5 years since fire). The models had reasonable predictive ability for eight species, some predictive ability for seven species, and were little better than random for one species. Bird species displayed a limited range of responses to time since fire; thus a small set of fire ages should allow the provision of habitat for most species. Postfire successional changes extend for decades and management of the age class distribution of vegetation will need to reflect this timescale. Response curves revealed important seral stages for species and highlighted the importance of mid- to late-successional vegetation (.20 years). Although time since fire clearly influences the distribution of numerous bird species, predictive models of the spatial distribution of species in fire-prone landscapes need to incorporate other factors in addition to time since fire.},

  abstract = {Predicting the response of faunal communities to fire presents a challenge for land managers worldwide because the post-fire responses of species may vary between locations and fire events. Post-fire recovery can occur via nucleated recovery from in situ surviving populations or by colonization from ex situ populations. Finescale spatial patterns in the patchiness of fires and the proximity of burnt sites to source populations may contribute to both the variability in post-fire responses and the processes by which populations recover. We examined the avifauna at recently burnt sites within extensive semi-arid shrublands of south-eastern Australia, including 72 sites {$<$} 5 years since fire and 26 sites 10 years since fire. Study sites represented a gradient of increasing distance from ‘unburnt’ vegetation (i.e. {$>$} 27 years since fire) and varied in the presence or absence of small (25–900 m2) unburnt patches of vegetation. For sites {$<$} 5 years since fire, species richness was higher at sites closer to unburnt vegetation and at sites containing unburnt patches. These patterns were no longer evident at sites of 10 years since fire. The probability of occurrence of three of seven bird species modelled decreased with increasing distance to unburnt vegetation, but this pattern was evident only at sites burnt uniformly. One species was found almost exclusively at patchily burnt sites. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that proximity to unburnt vegetation enhances post-fire occupancy, and that colonization from ex situ populations is an important process for post-fire recovery of avifauna. Additionally, small unburnt patches enhance the rapid recovery of assemblages post-fire. These patterns are important for understanding the dynamics of post-fire population recovery. We recommend that management of fire for ecological purposes should explicitly consider the role that the spatial attributes of fires play in determining the post-fire community.},

  abstract = {Aim Most approaches to conservation prioritization are focused on biodiversity features that are already threatened. While this is necessary in the face of accelerating anthropogenic threats, there have been calls to conserve large intact landscapes, often termed 'wilderness', to ensure the long-term persistence of biodiversity. In this study, we examine the consequences of directing conservation expenditure using a threat-based framework for wilderness conservation. Location The Australian continent. Methods We measured the degree of congruence between the extent of wilderness and the Australian protected area network in 2000 and 2006, which was established using a threat-based systematic planning framework. We also assessed priority areas for future reserve acquisitions identified by the Australian government under the current framework. Results In 2000, 14\% of Australia's wilderness was under formal protection, while the protected area network covered only 8.5\% of the continent, suggesting a historical bias towards wilderness protection. However, the expansion of the reserve system from 2000 to 2006 was biased towards non-wilderness areas. Moreover, 90\% of the wilderness that was protected over this period comprised areas not primarily designated for biodiversity conservation. We found a significant (P {$<$} 0.05) negative relationship between bioregions considered to be a priority for future reserve prioritization and the amount of wilderness they contain. Main conclusions While there is an urgent need to overcome past biases in reserve network design so as to better protect poorly represented species and habitats, prioritization approaches should not become so reactive as to ignore the role that large, intact landscapes play in conserving biodiversity, especially in a time of human-induced climate change. This can be achieved by using current or future threats rather than past threats to prioritize areas, and by incorporating key ecological processes and costs of acquisition and management within the planning framework.},

Here, I compare density estimates of four common farmland bird species (skylark, blackbird, song thrush, Australasian magpie) on South Island sheep \& beef farms collected using a large-scale monitoring scheme with equivalent estimates from a more intensive survey, and discuss possible sources of imprecision and bias in each. Density estimates from the intensive survey were generally lower and more precise than the monitoring-scheme ones, and the surveys were susceptible to different types of bias. These effects were linked to combined differences in modelling methods and sampling effort distribution, and to observer-related issues. In long-term designs, estimates from data pooled over several annual surveys are likely to become accurate quickly, but an increase in monitoring effort per site may be required to increase the precision of individual-survey estimates. Species that pose challenges to observers may be hard to estimate accurately with the monitoring-scheme design explored here, and the use of pilot surveys is recommended. Raw count data from the same species were tested for their usefulness in the creation of reliable relative population indices. A sufficiently constant ratio of plot-count indices to absolute density estimates was found in skylarks and thrushes, while inclusion of a correction parameter to account for woody vegetation effects on detectability was necessary in blackbirds, and magpie estimates proved unreliable. Similar analyses are recommended for all monitored species when trend estimation using relative indices is intended.},

Advanced remote sensing technologies provide data to assist in addressing these escalating information needs and to support the subsequent development and parameterization of models for an even broader range of information needs. This special issue contains papers that use a variety of remote sensing technologies to derive forest inventory or inventory-related information. Herein, we review the potential of 4 advanced remote sensing technologies, which we posit as having the greatest potential to influence forest inventories designed to characterize forest resource information for strategic, tactical, and operational planning: airborne laser scanning (ALS), terrestrial laser scanning (TLS), digital aerial photogrammetry (DAP), and high spatial resolution (HSR)/very high spatial resolution (VHSR) satellite optical imagery. ALS, in particular, has proven to be a transformative technology, offering forest inventories the required spatial detail and accuracy across large areas and a diverse range of forest types. The coupling of DAP with ALS technologies will likely have the greatest impact on forest inventory practices in the next decade, providing capacity for a broader suite of attributes, as well as for monitoring growth over time.},

The Kane Basin (KB) subpopulation is a group of high-latitude polar bears that ranges between High Arctic Canada and NW Greenland around and north of the North Water polynya (NOW). We conducted a line transect distance sampling aerial survey of KB polar bears during 28 April-12 May 2014. A total of 4160 linear kilometers were flown in a helicopter over fast ice in the fjords and over offshore pack ice between 76 degrees 50 ' and 80 degrees N '. Using a mark-recapture distance sampling protocol, the estimated abundance was 190 bears (95\% lognormal CI: 87-411; CV 39\%). This estimate is likely negatively biased to an unknown degree because the offshore sectors of the NOW with much open water were not surveyed because of logistical and safety reasons. Our study demonstrated that aerial surveys may be a feasible method for obtaining abundance estimates for small subpopulations of polar bears.},

Government and donor investments currently meet less than 30 per cent of the estimated recurring costs required to manage the protected-area network within central African countries effectively, and cover none of the growing opportunity costs incurred to maintain protected areas. Unfortunately, few additional sources of funding are available. Tourism is only economically viable where charismatic species exist in `safe' areas that are not more than a few hours drive in a 4x4 vehicle from an international airport-ostensibly excluding tourism from most of central Africa. In contrast, a review of available information suggests that safari hunting could offer a significant and sustainable source of financing to offset some of the costs of maintaining protected areas in central Africa. However, better quantitative data are needed to assess whether trophy hunting is both ecologically sustainable and economically competitive over the long term relative to other land uses.},

  abstract = {Unsustainable hunting of wildlife for food is often a more immediate and significant threat to the conservation of biological diversity in tropical forests than deforestation. Why people eat wildlife is debated. Some may eat bushmeat because they can afford it; others may eat it because it is familiar, traditional, confers prestige, tastes good, or adds variety. We completed a survey of 1208 rural and urban households in Gabon, Africa, in 2002-2003 to estimate the effect of wealth and prices on the consumption of wildlife and other sources of animal protein. Consumption of bushmeat, fish, chicken, and livestock increased with increasing household wealth, and as the price of these commodities rose, consumption declined. Although the prices of substitutes for bushmeat did not significantly, in statistical terms, influence bushmeat consumption, as the price of wildlife increased and its consumption fell, the consumption of fish rose, indicating that fish and bushmeat were dietary substitutes. Our results suggest that policy makers can use economic levers such as taxation or supply reduction through better law enforcement to change demand for wildlife. These measures will help to regulate unsustainable exploitation and reduce the risk of irreversible loss of large-bodied and slow-reproducing wildlife species. If policy makers focus solely on reducing the unsustainable consumption of wildlife, they may see adverse impacts on the exploitation of fish. Furthermore, policy makers must ensure that raising household wealth through development assistance does not result in undesirable impacts on the conservation status of wildlife and fish.},

  abstract = {Coarse woody debris (CWD) plays an important role in many terrestrial and aquatic ecosystem processes. In recent years, a number of new methods have been proposed to sample CWD. Of these methods, perpendicular distance sampling (PDS) is one of the most efficient methods for estimating CWD volume in terms of both estimator variance and field effort. This study extends the results for PDS to the estimation of the surface area of CWD. The PDS estimator is also compared to two line intersect sampling (LIS) estimators, where one of the LIS estimators requires the measurement of surface area on each log and the other estimates surface area using a single measurement of log circumference at the point of intersection between the log and the line. The first estimator approximates the true surface area by assuming either a conic or parabolic stem form and requires measurements of the end diameters of each log, which is more time consuming than a single measurement. The performance of the three estimators was compared using a computer simulation. The results of the simulation indicate that, given the same number of pieces of CWD sampled at each point, equal variances can be achieved with PDS using sample sizes that range from about 10\% to in excess of 100\% the size of a comparable LIS estimator. When the LIS estimators were compared, the estimator that required the measurement of surface area was only about 3\%-6\% more efficient than the alternative estimator, but the bias associated with assuming a conic or parabolic stem form ranged from roughly 5\% to 15\%. We conclude that PDS will generally outperform either of the LIS estimators. Another important conclusion is that the LIS estimator based on a measured surface area is likely to have a higher mean squared error than an LIS estimator that employs a single measurement of circumference. Thus, LIS sampling strategies that require the least amount of field work will often have the smallest mean square error.},

  abstract = {Information on animal abundance and distribution is at the cornerstone of many wildlife and conservation strategies. However, these data can be difficult and costly to obtain for cetacean species. The expense of sufficient ship time to conduct design-unbiased line transect surveys may be simply out of reach for researchers in many countries, which nonetheless grapple with problems of conservation of endangered species, by-catch of small cetaceans in commercial fisheries, and progression toward ecosystem-based fisheries management. Recently developed spatial modeling techniques show promise for estimating wildlife abundance using non-randomized surveys, but have yet to receive much field-testing in areas where designed surveys have also been conducted. Effort and sightings data were collected along 9 650 km of transects aboard ships of opportunity in the Southern Ocean during the austral summers of 2000 - 2001 and 2001 - 2002. Generalized additive models with generalized cross-validation were used to express heterogeneity of cetacean sightings as functions of spatial covariates. Models were used to map predicted densities and to estimate abundance of humpback, minke, and fin whales in the Drake Passage and along the Antarctic Peninsula. All species' distribution maps showed strong density gradients, which were robust to jackknife resampling when each of 14 trips was removed sequentially with replacement. Looped animations of model predictions of whale density illustrate uncertainty in distribution estimates in a way that is informative to non-scientists. The best abundance estimate for humpback whales was 1 829 (95\% CI: 978- 3 422). Abundance of fin whales was 4 487 ( 95\% CI: 1 326 - 15 179) and minke whales was 1,544 ( 95\% CI: 1,221 - 1,953). These estimates agreed roughly with those reported from a designed survey conducted in the region during the previous austral summer. These estimates assumed that all animals on the trackline were detected, but preliminary results suggest that any negative bias due to violation of this assumption was likely small. Similarly, current methodological limitations prohibit inclusion of all known sources of uncertainty in the favored variance estimator. Meanwhile, our approach can be seen generally as an inexpensive pilot study to identify areas of predicted high density that could be targeted to: inform stratified designs for future line transect surveys, making them less expensive and more precise; increase efficiency of future photo-identification or biopsy studies; identify candidate time-area fisheries closures to minimize by-catch; or direct ecotourism activities. The techniques are likely to apply to areas where funding is limiting, where cetacean studies or wilderness-based tourism are just beginning, or in regions where even a very rough estimate of animal abundance is needed for conservation or management purposes.},

However, no ungulate monitoring methods is entirely satisfying in terms of cost-effectiveness and accuracy. A new method combining unmanned aerial vehicles (drones) and thermal infrared (TIR) imaging may have great potential as a tool for ungulate surveys. Drones enable safe operations at low flying altitudes, and at night - a time that often offers the optimal conditions for wildlife monitoring. To assess the feasibility of the proposed method we used fixed-wing drones with TIR cameras to conduct test surveys in Drawieski National Park, Poland. We demonstrated that ungulate thermal signatures are visible both in leafless deciduous and in pine-dominated coniferous forests. Survey timing highly influenced the results - the best quality thermal images were obtained at sunrise, late evening, and at night. Our preliminary results indicated that thermal surveys from drones are a promising method for ungulate enumeration. We demonstrated that with ground resolution of similar to 10cm it is possible to visibly distinguish large species (i.e. red deer) and achieve a good level of area coverage. The main challenges of the method are difficulties in species identification due to relatively low resolution of TIR cameras, regulations limiting drone operations to visual line of sight, and high dependence on weather.},

In habitats where direct observation is difficult (rain forests, oceans), or for cryptic species (shy, nocturnal), passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) provides cost-effective, unbiased data collection. PAM has broad applicability in terrestrial environments, particularly tropical rain forests. Using examples from studies of forest elephants in Central African rain forest, we show how PAM can be used to investigate cryptic behaviour, mechanisms of communication, estimate population size, quantify threats, and assess the efficacy of conservation strategies. We discuss the methodologies, requirements, and challenges of obtaining these data using acoustics. Where applicable, we compare these methods to more traditional approaches. While PAM methods and associated analysis are maturing rapidly, mechanisms are needed for processing the dense raw data efficiently with standard computer hardware, speeding development of detection algorithms, and harnessing communication networks to move data from the field to research facilities. Passive acoustic monitoring is a viable and cost-effective tool for conservation and should be incorporated in monitoring schemes much more broadly. The capability to quickly assess changes in behaviour, population size, and landscape use, simultaneously over large geographical areas, makes this approach attractive for detecting human-induced impacts and for assessing the success of conservation strategies.},

  abstract = {1. Effective wildlife habitat management and conservation requires understanding the factors influencing distribution and abundance of plant species. Field studies, however, have documented observation errors in visually estimated plant cover including measurements which differ from the true value (measurement error) and not observing a species that is present within a plot (detection error). Unlike the rapid expansion of occupancy and N-mixture models for analysing wildlife surveys, development of statistical models accounting for observation error in plants has not progressed quickly. Our work informs development of a monitoring protocol for managed wetlands within the National Wildlife Refuge System. 2. Zero-augmented beta (ZAB) regression is the most suitable method for analysing areal plant cover recorded as a continuous proportion but assumes no observation errors. We present a model extension that explicitly includes the observation process thereby accounting for both measurement and detection errors. Using simulations, we compare our approach to a ZAB regression that ignores observation errors (naive model) and an ad hoc approach using a composite of multiple observations per plot within the naive model. We explore how sample size and within-season revisit design affect the ability to detect a change in mean plant cover between 2years using our model. 3. Explicitly modelling the observation process within our framework produced unbiased estimates and nominal coverage of model parameters. The naive and ad hoc approaches resulted in underestimation of occurrence and overestimation of mean cover. The degree of bias was primarily driven by imperfect detection and its relationship with cover within a plot. Conversely, measurement error had minimal impacts on inferences. We found {$>$}30 plots with at least three within-season revisits achieved reasonable posterior probabilities for assessing change in mean plant cover. 4. For rapid adoption and application, code for Bayesian estimation of our single-species ZAB with errors model is included. Practitioners utilizing our R-based simulation code can explore trade-offs among different survey efforts and parameter values, as we did, but tuned to their own investigation. Less abundant plant species of high ecological interest may warrant the additional cost of gathering multiple independent observations in order to guard against erroneous conclusions.},

  abstract = {Forests are an important global resource, playing key roles in both the environment and the economy. The implementation of quality national monitoring programs is required for the generation of robust national statistics, which in turn support global reporting. Conventional monitoring initiatives based on samples of field plots have proven robust but are difficult and costly to implement and maintain, especially for large jurisdictions or where access is difficult. To address this problem, air photo- and satellite-based large area mapping and monitoring programs have been developed; however, these programs also require ground measurements for calibration and validation. To mitigate this need for ground plot data we propose the collection and integration of light detection and ranging (lidar) based plot data. Lidar enables accurate measures of vertical forest structure, including canopy height, volume, and biomass. Rather than acquiring wall-to-wall lidar coverage, we propose the acquisition of a sample of scanned lidar transects to estimate conditions over large areas. Given an appropriate sampling framework, statistics can be generated from the lidar plots extracted from the transects. In other instances, the lidar plots may be treated similar to ground plots, providing locally relevant information that can be used independently or integrated with other data sources, including optical remotely sensed data. In this study we introduce the concept of ‘‘lidar plots’’ to support forest inventory and scientific applications, particularly for large areas. Many elements must be considered when planning a transect-based lidar survey, including survey design, flight and sensor parameters, acquisition considerations, mass data processing, and database development. We present a case study describing the acquisition of over 25 000 km of lidar data in Canada’s boreal forests in the summer of 2010. The survey, which included areas of managed and unmanaged forests, resulted in the production of more than 17 million 25 ) 25 m lidar plots with first returns greater than 2 m in height. We conclude with insights gained from the case study and recommendations for future surveys.},

Comparing forest structural parameters retrieved using EVI data with extensive ground measurements, we found excellent agreement at the site level using five EVI scans (plots) per site (R2 = 0.94–0.99); very good agreement at the plot level for stem count density and biomass (R2 = 0.90–0.85); and good agreement at the plot level for mean DBH and basal area (R2 = 0.48–0.66). The observed variance at site and plot levels suggest that a sample area of at least 1 ha (104 m2) is required to estimate these parameters accurately at the stand level using either lidar-based or conventional methods. The algorithms and procedures used to retrieve these structural parameters are dependent on the unique ability of the Echidna® lidar to digitize the full waveform of the scattered lidar pulse as it returns to the instrument, which allows consistent separation of scattering by trunks and large branches from scattering by leaves. This successful application of ground-based lidar technology opens the door to rapid and accurate measurement of biomass and timber volume in areal sampling scenarios and as a calibration and validation tool for mapping biomass using airborne or spaceborne remotely sensed data.},

  abstract = {Recovery of grassland birds in agricultural landscapes is a global imperative. Agricultural landscapes are complex, and the value of resource patches may vary substantially among species. The spatial extent at which landscape features affect populations (i.e., scale of effect) may also differ among species. There is a need for regional-scale conservation planning that considers landscape-scale and species-specific responses of grassland birds to environmental change. We developed a spatially explicit approach to optimizing grassland conservation in the context of species-specific landscapes and prioritization of species recovery and applied it to a conservation program in Kentucky (USA). We used a hierarchical distance-sampling model with an embedded scale of effect predictor to estimate the relationship between landscape structure and abundance of eastern meadowlarks (Sturnella magna), field sparrows (Spizella pusilla), and northern bobwhites (Colinus virginianus). We used a novel spatially explicit optimization procedure rooted in multi-attribute utility theory to design alternative conservation strategies (e.g., prioritize only northern bobwhite recovery or assign equal weight to each species’ recovery). Eastern meadowlarks and field sparrows were more likely to respond to landscape-scale resource patch adjacencies than landscape-scale patch densities. Northern bobwhite responded to both landscape-scale resource patch adjacencies and densities and responded strongly to increased grassland density. Effects of landscape features on local abundance decreased as distance increased and had negligible influence at 0.8 km for eastern meadowlarks (0.7–1.2 km 95\% Bayesian credibility intervals [BCI]), 2.5 km for field sparrows (1.5–5.8 km 95\% BCI), and 8.4 km for bobwhite (6.4–26 km 95\% BCI). Northern bobwhites were predicted to benefit greatly from future grassland conservation regardless of conservation priorities, but eastern meadowlark and field sparrow were not. Our results suggest similar species can respond differently to broad-scale conservation practices because of species-specific, distance-dependent relationships with landscape structure. Our framework is quantitative, conceptually simple, customizable, and predictive and can be used to optimize conservation in heterogeneous ecosystems while considering landscape-scale processes and explicit prioritization of species recovery.},

Many jurisdictions are letting private interests and/or users of the resource base help fund conservation projects. Thus funding for conservation is becoming more dependent on donations to environmental causes either through direct giving of funds or through memberships in organizations. This study explores some determinants of private contributions to environmental conservation activities through an econometric analysis of donations and memberships relating to wildlife habitat protection and enhancement. We use data from a 1991 survey conducted in the three prairie provinces that provides information on donation behavior, income, wildlife-related activity, household compositions, and a variety of other factors. A double-hurdle econometric model is used to allow independent variables to have different effects on the probability of donations and the level of donations. Our empirical results suggest that changes in the economy will be important to donation behavior. Declines in participation and recruitment in hunting will also have impacts on donations to conservation causes, but these impacts, although significant, may not be as large. However, consumptive and nonconsumptive activities may be influenced by management agencies and used to bolster environmental donations.},

Although numerous techniques are available, there have been few comparisons of the precision and cost-effectiveness of different approaches. We assess the precision and cost of three methods for estimating densities of the Endangered Grevy's zebra Equus grevyi. We compare distance sampling and photographic capture-recapture, and a new technique, the random encounter model (REM) that uses camera-trap encounter rates to estimate density. All three methods provide comparable density estimates for Grevy's zebra and are preferable to the common practice of raw counts. Photographic capture-recapture is the most precise and line-transect distance sampling the least precise. Line transects and photographic capture-recapture surveys are cost-effective in the first year and REM is most cost-effective in the long-term. The methods used here for Grevy's zebra may be applied to other rangeland ungulates. We suggest that for single species monitoring programmes in which individuals can be identified, photographic capture-recapture surveys may be the preferred method for estimating wildlife abundances. When encounter rates are low, distance sampling lacks the precision of the other methods but its cost advantage may make it appropriate for long-term or multi-species monitoring programmes. The REM is an efficient and precise method of estimating densities but has high initial equipment costs. We believe REM has the potential to work well for many species but it requires independent estimates of animal movements and group size.},

In particular, we transformed the endmember extraction problem in the decomposition of mixed pixels into an issue of optimization and built feasible solution space to evaluate the practical significance of the objective function, thereby establishing two ant colony optimization algorithms for endmember extraction. In addition to the detailed process of calculation, we also addressed the effects of different operating parameters on algorithm performance. Finally we designed two sets of simulation data experiments and one set of actual data experiments, and the results of those experiments prove that endmember extraction based on ant colony algorithms can avoid some defects of N-FINDR, VCA and other algorithms, improve the representation of endmembers for all image pixels, decrease the average value of root-mean-square error, and therefore achieve better endmember extraction results than the N-FINDR and VCA algorithms.},

We conducted trials at 28 plots within six stands of hardwoods and conifers of varying height and stocking densities at Harvard Forest, Massachusetts, Bartlett Experimental Forest, New Hampshire, and Howland Experimental Forest, Maine, in July 2007. Effective LAI values retrieved by four methods, which ranged from 3.42 to 5.25 depending on the site and method, were not significantly different (β b 0.1 among four methods). The LAI values also matched published values well. Foliage profiles (leaf area with height) retrieved from the lidar scans, although not independently validated, were consistent with stand structure as observed and as measured by conventional methods. Canopy mean top height, as determined from the foliage profiles, deviated from mean RH100 values obtained from the Lidar Vegetation Imaging Sensor (LVIS) airborne largefootprint lidar system at 27 plots by − 0.91 m with RMSE = 2.04 m, documenting the ability of the EVI to retrieve stand height.

Traditional sustainable management approaches are to analyze different scenarios subject to assumptions or to construct simulation-optimization models to obtain optimal strategy. However, groundwater system is time-varying due to exogenous inputs. In this sense, the groundwater management based on static data is relatively outdated. As part of the Heihe River Basin (HRB), which is a typical arid river basin in Northwestern China, the Daman irrigation district was selected as the study area in this paper. First, a simulation-optimization model was constructed to optimize the pumping rates of the study area according to the groundwater level constraints. Three different groundwater level constraints were assigned to explore sustainable strategies for groundwater resources. The results indicated that the simulation-optimization model was capable of identifying the optimal pumping yields and satisfy the given constraints. Second, the simulation-optimization model was integrated with wireless sensors network (WSN) technology to provide real-time features for the management. The results showed time-varying feature for the groundwater management, which was capable of updating observations, constraints, and decision variables in real time. Furthermore, a web-based platform was developed to facilitate the decision-making process. This study combined simulation and optimization model with WSN techniques and meanwhile attempted to real-time monitor and manage the scarce groundwater resource, which could be used to support the decision-making related to sustainable management.},

Across an extensive (187 km2) heterogeneous forest-mosaic landscape in eastern England, spatially explicit density surface models of roe deer Capreolus capreolus and introduced muntjac Muntiacus reevesi were calibrated by thermal imaging distance sampling (recording 1590 and 400 muntjac and roe deer groups, respectively, on 567~km of driven transects). Models related deer density to local habitat composition, recreational intensity, and deer density (roe deer models controlled for muntjac density and vice versa) at a local grain across 1162 composite transect segments, incorporating geographical coordinates accounting for spatial autocorrelation. Abundance of both species was lower in localities with more grasslands (inter-quartile, IQ, effect size: roe\,−2.9 deer/km2; muntjac\,−2.9 deer/km2). Roe abundance (mean\,=\,7~deer/km2, SD\,=\,6) was greater in localities with more young stands (IQ effect size,\,+\,1.3 deer/km2) and lower at localities with more recreationists (−1.1 deer/km2). Muntjac density (mean\,=\,21 deer/km2, SD\,=\,10) was greater in localities with more recreationists (+\,2.4 deer/km2), with more mature (≥\,46~years) stands (+\,1.5 deer/km2), or calcareous soil (+\,7.1 deer/km2). Comparison of models incorporating candidate variables and models comprising geographical coordinates only shows candidate variables to be weak predictors of deer densities. Adapting forest management to manipulate habitat and recreational access may influence local deer densities, but only subtly: effect sizes are not sufficient to mitigate deer impacts through planting vulnerable tree crops in areas avoided by deer. Effective culling remains the most viable management option.},

To determine optimal management strategies, it is essential to understand species-habitat relationships and how species habitat use is related to natural or human-induced environmental changes. Using five years of monitoring data in the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal National Historical Park, Maryland, USA, we developed four multispecies hierarchical models for estimating amphibian wetland use that account for imperfect detection during sampling. The models were designed to determine which factors (wetland habitat characteristics, annual trend effects, spring/summer precipitation, and previous wetland occupancy) were most important for predicting future habitat use. We used the models to make predictions about species occurrences in sampled and unsampled wetlands and evaluated model projections using additional data. Using a Bayesian approach, we calculated a posterior distribution of receiver operating characteristic area under the curve (ROC AUC) values, which allowed us to explicitly quantify the uncertainty in the quality of our predictions and to account for false negatives in the evaluation data set. We found that wetland hydroperiod (the length of time that a wetland holds water), as well as the occurrence state in the prior year, were generally the most important factors in determining occupancy. The model with habitat-only covariates predicted species occurrences well; however, knowledge of wetland use in the previous year significantly improved predictive ability at the community level and for two of 12 species/species complexes. Our results demonstrate the utility of multispecies models for understanding which factors affect species habitat use of an entire community (of species) and provide an improved methodology using AUC that is helpful for quantifying the uncertainty in model predictions while explicitly accounting for detection biases.},

It requires the estimation of camera-animal observation distances, which previously was done by comparing animal positions to reference labels at predefined intervals. Here, we test a photogrammetry approach to derive camera-animal observation distances. We applied both, the reference label and photogrammetry approaches to five ungulate species varying widely in body size (Giraffa camelopardalis, Equus grevyi, Oryx dammah, Kobus megaceros and Eudorcas thomsonii) and one ground-dwelling bird species (Numida meleagris) inhabiting a large enclosure and estimated their density with CTDS. Both procedures provided highly correlated observation distances (rho = 0.99, p {$<$} 0.001). A paired t test revealed a minor but significantly higher mean of the photogrammetry approach (MD = 0.28 m, p {$<$} 0.001). This, however, seems negligible as for analyses, distances were grouped in intervals of 2 to 5 metres. In general, estimated animal abundance was close to the true number of individuals in the enclosure for both approaches, with the exception of zebra, whose density was underestimated. The photogrammetry approach offers an alternative approach for deriving camera-animal observation distances and is particularly useful for application in open habitats, with little occlusion of animals.},

Reserves or parks that are inhabited by flagship species may be able to generate more revenue through tourism than those without such species because flagship species have great potential for raising funds and creating publicity for conservation goals. In this paper, we examine flagship species tourism focused on observing the golden snub-nosed monkey (Rhinopithecus roxellana) in Shennongjia National Nature Reserve (SNNR). After the program was launched in 2006, both the number of tourists and amount of revenue received by SNNR increased as the general trends of tourism revenue in the country also increased. As a result, SNNR significantly increased reinvestment in tourism and conservation infrastructure. Furthermore, after senior politicians visited the golden snub-nosed monkey, they abruptly changed their attitudes toward biological conservation, as indicated by an increase in both regular and additional funding for the species conservation. We conclude that flagship species tourism may not only generate revenue for conservation and management but also can improve officials' attitudes toward preserving biodiversity. However, it is important to ensure the continued safety and sustainability of such programs, from both the human and animal perspective, and we suggest stricter measures are introduced to reduce the risk of aerosol disease transmission from tourists to the monkeys.},

In 2005 and 2006 combined, we surveyed 120 1-km transects to estimate density and 40 3-ha plots 5 times each to estimate occupancy of Sonoran desert tortoises in 2 mountain ranges in southern Arizona, USA. For both mountain ranges combined, we estimated density to be 0.30 adult tortoises/ha (95\% CI = 0.17-0.43) and occupancy to be 0.72 (95\% CI = 0.56-0.89). For the sampling designs we evaluated, monitoring efforts based on occupancy were 8-36\% more efficient than those based on density, when contrasting only survey effort, and 17-30\% more efficient when contrasting total effort (surveying, hiking to and from survey locations, and radiotracking). Occupancy had greater statistical power to detect annual declines in the proportion of area occupied than did distance sampling to detect annual declines in density. For example, we estimated that power to detect a 5\% annual decline with 10 years of annual sampling was 0.92 (95\% CI = 0.75-0.98) for occupancy and 0.43 (95\% CI = 0.35-0.52) for distance sampling. Although all sampling methods have limitations, occupancy estimation offers a promising alternative for monitoring populations of rare vertebrates, including tortoises in the Sonoran Desert.},
