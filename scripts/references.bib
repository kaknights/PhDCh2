  abstract = {Despite of the generalized expansion of wild ungulates in Europe, roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) is experiencing contrasted population trends; it is expanding in some regions while declining in others likely due to the expansion of other deer species. In both extremes, reliable methods to estimate population abundance are required. We evaluated different methods of estimating deer abundance in Mediterranean woodlands based on pellet group counts. Distance Sampling applied to pellet counts and a new easier and cost-effective method based on strip-variable transect counts (FST) were assessed comparing their estimates (pellet group density) with the abundance indices obtained from traditionally used reference methods (faecal standing crop) in 61 localities (n = 183 surveys). The average roe deer density estimated from faecal standing crop was 5.56 +/- 0.75 (range 0.01-20.74) deer per 100 ha. Distance Sampling and FST estimates correlated with reference methods. As a first conclusion it may be noted that all indirect methods used here can be used to estimate roe deer abundance. The selection of a given method based on pellet counts to estimate roe deer population abundance should take into account the specific objectives of the research, resources available, and the timescale in which the information is required. Among them, Distance Sampling may be used when human resources and skills are enough but FST is a rapid and efficient alternative to estimate pellet group density when they are not.

  abstract = {Sampling strategies commonly used for coarse woody debris (CWD) inventories, including line intersect sampling (LIS), typically require large sample sizes to estimate aggregate volume with reasonable precision. Line intersect distance sampling (LIDS) is a recently developed strategy based on a probability proportional-to-volume design and a linear sampling unit. In principle, the design augments the precision of volume estimators by increasing the intensity with which bulkier particles are sampled, while the transect-based protocol facilitates the search for qualifying particles. This study reports on the relative performances of LIDS and LIS in seven stands in Montana, USA. Particles selected by LIDS were consistently less numerous but larger in cross section than those selected at the same locations by LIS. In timed field trials, LIDS required more time than LIS, but CWD volume estimates from LIDS were generally more precise, more than offsetting the time differential. Conversely, aggregate length and abundance of CWD were generally estimated more efficiently with LIS. Results suggest that LIDS permits more efficient use of survey resources than LIS where CWD inventories focus on parameters relating to volume, biomass, or carbon. However, the constant volume factor design of LIDS is not advantageous where CWD frequency is of central interest.},

  abstract = {Simple Summary To detect changes in migrating bird populations that are usually gradual, regular counts of the flocks should be carried out. This is vital for giving more precise management decisions and taking preventive actions when necessary. Traditional counting methods are widely used. However, these methods can be expensive, time-consuming, and highly dependent on the mental and physical status of the observer and environmental factors. Taking these uncertainties into account, we aimed at taking the advantage of the advances in the artificial intelligence (AI) field for a more standardized counting action. The study has been practically initiated 10 years ago by beginning to take photos on a yearly basis in predefined regions of Turkey. After a large collection of bird photos had been gathered, we predicted the bird counts in photo locations from images by making strong use of AI. Finally, we used these counts to produce several bird distribution maps for further analysis. Our results showed the potential of learning computers in support of real-world bird monitoring applications. A challenging problem in the field of avian ecology is deriving information on bird population movement trends. This necessitates the regular counting of birds which is usually not an easily-achievable task. A promising attempt towards solving the bird counting problem in a more consistent and fast way is to predict the number of birds in different regions from their photos. For this purpose, we exploit the ability of computers to learn from past data through deep learning which has been a leading sub-field of AI for image understanding. Our data source is a collection of on-ground photos taken during our long run of birding activity. We employ several state-of-the-art generic object-detection algorithms to learn to detect birds, each being a member of one of the 38 identified species, in natural scenes. The experiments revealed that computer-aided counting outperformed the manual counting with respect to both accuracy and time. As a real-world application of image-based bird counting, we prepared the spatial bird order distribution and species diversity maps of Turkey by utilizing the geographic information system (GIS) technology. Our results suggested that deep learning can assist humans in bird monitoring activities and increase citizen scientists' participation in large-scale bird surveys.},

For the correct management of populations under differing scenarios, accurate and precise estimates of bird abundances and/or densities are required. We used geolocated datasets from 56 counts of singing males carried out in 2003-2017 to estimate the density of Pyrenean rock ptarmigans (Lagopus muta pyrenaica). We analysed these datasets using two methodologies: (1) a plot sampling (PS) approach with two effective detection ranges (EDR) of 250 m and 350 m and (2) a conventional distance sampling (DS) approach. Our results showed that the density estimates obtained by DS were more precise and 30-87\% higher than those obtained by PS using 250 m and 350 m EDR. Monitoring with PS underestimates populations and is less precise than DS; this bias is magnified when high EDR values are used. The monitoring of the Pyrenean rock ptarmigan could be significantly improved with greater use of the DS method.},

  abstract = {Monitoring programs, where numbers of individuals are followed through time, are central to conservation. Although incomplete detection is expected with wildlife surveys, this topic is rarely considered with plants. However, if plants are missed in surveys, raw count data can lead to biased estimates of population abundance and vital rates. To illustrate, we had five independent observers survey patches of the rare plant Asclepias meadii at two prairie sites. We analyzed data with two mark-recapture approaches. Using the program CAPTURE, the estimated number of patches equaled the detected number for a burned site, but exceeded detected numbers by 28\% for an unburned site. Analyses of detected patches using Huggins models revealed important effects of observer, patch state (flowering/nonflowering), and patch size (number of stems) on probabilities of detection. Although some results were expected (i.e. greater detection of flowering than nonflowering patches), the importance of our approach is the ability to quantify the magnitude of detection problems. We also evaluated the degree to which increased observer numbers improved detection: smaller groups (3–4 observers) generally found 90 – 99\% of the patches found by all five people, but pairs of observers or single observers had high error and detection depended on which individuals were involved. We conclude that an intensive study at the start of a longterm monitoring study provides essential information about probabilities of detection and what factors cause plants to be missed. This information can guide development of monitoring programs.},

We used a bird song simulation system to quantify the effects of detection distance, singing rate, species differences, and observer differences on detection probabilities of birds detected by ear. We simulated 40 point counts consisting of 10 birds per count for five primary species ( Black- and- white Warbler Mniotilta varia, Black- throated Blue Warbler Dendroica caerulescens, Black- throated Green Warbler Dendroica virens, Hooded Warbler Wilsonia citrina, and Ovenbird Seiurus aurocapillus) over a range of 15 distances ( 34 - 143 m). Songs were played at low ( two songs per count) and high ( 13 - 21 songs per count) singing rates. Detection probabilities averaged across observers ranged from 0.60 ( Black- and- white Warbler) to 0.83 ( Hooded Warbler) at the high singing rate and 0.41 ( Black- and- white Warbler) to 0.67 ( Hooded Warbler) at the low singing rate. Logistic regression analyses indicated that species, singing rate, distance, and observer were all significant factors affecting detection probabilities. Singing rate 3 species and singing rate 3 distance interactions were also signi. cant. Simulations of expected counts, based on the best logistic model, indicated that observers detected between 19\% ( for the worst observer, lowest singing rate, and least detectable species) and 65\% ( for the best observer, highest singing rate, and most detectable species) of the true population. Detection probabilities on actual point count surveys are likely to vary even more because many sources of variability were controlled in our experiments. These findings strongly support the importance of adjusting measures of avian diversity or abundance from auditory point counts with direct estimates of detection probability.},

  abstract = {The time-of-detection method for aural avian point counts is a new method of estimating abundance, allowing for uncertain probability of detection. The method has been specifically designed to allow for variation in singing rates of birds. It involves dividing the time interval of the point count into several subintervals and recording the detection history of the subintervals when each bird sings. The method can be viewed as generating data equivalent to closed capture-recapture information. The method is different from the distance and multiple-observer methods in that it is not required that all the birds sing during the point count. As this method is new and there is some concern as to how well individual birds can be followed, we carried out a field test of the method using simulated known populations of singing birds, using a laptop computer to send signals to audio stations distributed around a point. The system mimics actual aural avian point counts, but also allows us to know the size and spatial distribution of the populations we are sampling. Fifty 8-min point counts (broken into four 2-min intervals) using eight species of birds were simulated. Singing rate of an individual bird of a species was simulated following a Markovian process (singing bouts followed by periods of silence), which we felt was more realistic than a truly random process. The main emphasis of our paper is to compare results from species singing at (high and low) homogenous rates per interval with those singing at (high and low) heterogeneous rates. Population size was estimated accurately for the species simulated, with a high homogeneous probability of singing. Populations of simulated species with lower but homogeneous singing probabilities were somewhat underestimated. Populations of species simulated with heterogeneous singing probabilities were substantially underestimated. Underestimation was caused by both the very low detection probabilities of all distant individuals and by individuals with low singing rates also having very low detection probabilities.},

We present examples of this approach applied to distance, time of detection and multiple observer sampling for avian point count data. Models that included species as a covariate and individual species effects were generally selected as the best models for distance sampling, but group models without species effects performed best for the time of detection and multiple observer methods. Population estimates were more precise for no-species-effect models than for species-effect models, demonstrating the benefits of exploiting species' similarities when modelling multiple species data. Partial species-effect models and additive models were also useful because they modelled similarities among species while allowing for species differences. Synthesis and applications. We recommend the adoption of multiple-species modelling because of its potential for improved population estimates.

  abstract = {Point-count surveys are o en used to collect data on the abundance and distribution of birds, generally as an index of relative abundance. Valid comparison of these indices assumes that the detection process is comparable over space and time. These restrictive assumptions can be eliminated by estimating detection probabilities directly. We generalize a recently proposed removal model for estimating detection probabilities using a time-of-detection approach, which can account for more sources of variation in point-count data. This method is specifically designed to account for variation in detection probabilities associated with singing rates of birds. Our model accounts for both availability bias and detection bias by modeling the combined probability that a bird sings during the count, and the probability that it is detected given that it sings. The model requires dividing the count into several intervals and recording detections of individual birds in each interval. We develop maximum-likelihood estimators for this approach and provide a full suite of models based on capture–recapture models, including covariate models. We present two examples of this method: one for four species of songbirds surveyed in Great Smoky Mountains National Park using three unequal intervals, and one for the Pearly-eyed Thrasher (Margarops fuscatus) surveyed in Puerto Rico using four equal intervals. Models incorporating individual heterogeneity were selected for all data sets using information-theoretic model-selection techniques. Detection probabilities varied among count-time intervals, which suggests that birds may be responding to observers. We recommend applying this method to surveys with four or more equal intervals to reduce assumptions and to take full advantage of standard capture–recapture so ware. The time-of-detection approach provides a better understanding of the detection process, especially when singing rates of individual birds affect detection probabilities.

Valid comparison of these indices assumes that the detection process is comparable over space and time. These restrictive assumptions can be eliminated by estimating detection probabilities directly. We generalize a recently proposed removal model for estimating detection probabilities using a time-of-detection approach, which can account for more sources of variation in point-count data. This method is specifically designed to account for variation in detection probabilities associated with singing rates of birds. Our model accounts for both availability bias and detection bias by modeling the combined probability that a bird sings during the count, and the probability that it is detected given that it sings. The model requires dividing the count into several intervals and recording detections of individual birds in each interval. We develop maximum-likelihood estimators for this approach and provide a full suite of models based on capture-recapture models, including covariate models. We present two examples of this method: one for four species of songbirds surveyed in Great Smoky Mountains National Part: using three unequal intervals, and one for the Pearly-eyed Thrasher (Margarops fuscatus) surveyed in Puerto Rico using four equal intervals. Models incorporating individual heterogeneity were selected for all data sets using information-theoretic model-selection techniques. Detection probabilities varied among count-time intervals, which suggests that birds may be responding to observers. We recommend applying this method to surveys with four or more equal intervals to reduce assumptions and to take full advantage of standard capture-recapture software. The time-of-detection approach provides a better understanding of the detection process, especially when singing rates of individual birds affect detection probabilities.},

  abstract = {Finding an adequate measure of hunting sustainability for tropical forests has proved difficult. Many researchers have used urban bushmeat market surveys as indicators of hunting volumes and composition, but no analysis has been done of the reliability of market data in reflecting village offtake. We used data from urban markets and the villages that supply these markets to examine changes in the volume and composition of traded bushmeat between the village and the market (trade filters) in Equatorial Guinea. We collected data with market surveys and hunter offtake diaries. The trade filters varied depending on village remoteness and the monopoly power of traders. In a village with limited market access, species that maximized trader profits were most likely to be traded. In a village with greater market access, species for which hunters gained the greatest income per carcass were more likely to be traded. The probability of particular species being sold to market also depended on the capture method and season. Larger, more vulnerable species were more likely to be supplied from less-accessible catchments, whereas there was no effect of forest cover or human population density on probability of being sold. This suggests that the composition of bushmeat offtake in an area may be driven more by urban demand than the geographic characteristics of that area. In one market, traders may have reached the limit of their geographical exploitation range, and hunting pressure within that range may be increasing. Our results demonstrate that it is possible to model the trade filters that bias market data, which opens the way to developing more robust market-based sustainability indices for the bushmeat trade.},

  abstract = {Pellet group count methods are key tools for wildlife conservation and management. Therefore, it is essential to clarify the performance and suitability of the different pellet group count methods at distinct realities. This issue has been discussed by other researchers but with inconsistent conclusions, leaving open the necessity of additional studies. Aiming to fill this need, we used a combination of field data and simulation models to evaluate the density estimates, precision and potential accuracy of the results obtained through each pellet group count method, and also the sampling effort and efficiency associated with them. The methods evaluated were standing crop plot counts (FSCP), clearance plot counts (FAR), standing crop strip transect counts (ST) and standing crop line transect counts (LT). Deer density estimates by the four methods were statistically similar at all effort levels simulated. The analyses of CV trends reveal a better precision supplied by FSCP than by FAR for the same effort, while ST and LT yielded comparable values in analogous situations. The time required to make a survey is a key factor in the choice of a field technique. LT with distance sampling was the most efficient method to count pellet groups, while FAR seems to be the less proficient method. Attending to the limitations usually inherent to field surveys, like time, technicians and budget, LT appeared more efficient than the other methods, providing great precision and accuracy in less time. Nevertheless, at high densities and pronounced habitat heterogeneity, FAR became more efficient than FSC, do not requiring the decay rates, allowing accurate estimates in a few months when applied with the proper effort and environmental conditions. This study highlights the importance of carrying out pilot studies and simulation models to evaluate the sampling design prior to its implementation in the field.

  abstract = {Imperfect detection during animal surveys biases estimates of abundance and can lead to improper conclusions regarding distribution and population trends. Farnsworth et al. (2005) developed a combined distance-sampling and time-removal model for point-transect surveys that addresses both availability (the probability that an animal is available for detection; e.g., that a bird sings) and perceptibility (the probability that an observer detects an animal, given that it is available for detection). We developed a hierarchical extension of the combined model that provides an integrated analysis framework for a collection of survey points at which both distance from the observer and time of initial detection are recorded. Implemented in a Bayesian framework, this extension facilitates evaluating covariates on abundance and detection probability, incorporating excess zero counts (i.e. zero-inflation), accounting for spatial autocorrelation, and estimating population density. Species-specific characteristics, such as behavioral displays and territorial dispersion, may lead to different patterns of availability and perceptibility, which may, in turn, influence the performance of such hierarchical models. Therefore, we first test our proposed model using simulated data under different scenarios of availability and perceptibility. We then illustrate its performance with empirical point-transect data for a songbird that consistently produces loud, frequent, primarily auditory signals, the Golden-crowned Sparrow (Zonotrichia atricapilla); and for 2 ptarmigan species (Lagopus spp.) that produce more intermittent, subtle, and primarily visual cues. Data were collected by multiple observers along point transects across a broad landscape in southwest Alaska, so we evaluated point-level covariates on perceptibility (observer and habitat), availability (date within season and time of day), and abundance (habitat, elevation, and slope), and included a nested point-within-transect and park-level effect. Our results suggest that this model can provide insight into the detection process during avian surveys and reduce bias in estimates of relative abundance but is best applied to surveys of species with greater availability (e.g., breeding songbirds).},

Few pairs bred in 2011-2013 and almost no birds in juvenile plumage were seen. Long-term data suggest that poor breeding began in 1998. Lack of recruitment over this period would mean that the current population is mostly elderly and experiencing senescent decline in performance. Anthropogenic effects such as introduced predators are unlikely to explain this decline because islands with and without such factors exhibited the same low breeding. The poor reproduction seems to be linked to diet. Previous work indicated that sardine and herring (Clupeidae) supported successful breeding, but these fish were mostly absent from the diet during this study, except in the central part of Galapagos, where most breeding attempts during this study occurred. Elsewhere in the eastern Pacific sardine abundance has decreased dramatically by natural processes in the last 15 years, as part of a well-documented and apparently natural cycle. This cyclic change in abundance provides a possible explanation for the recent demographic changes in Blue-footed Boobies in Galapagos. Whether natural or anthropogenic in origin, the implications of senescent decline in breeding ability and survival are dramatic for this genetically distinct icon of biodiversity and ecotourism.},

A simultaneous survey on Sierra Negra volcano on Isabela Island added five more individuals. However, observations from early expeditions and expeditions since 2015 have shown that the volcanoes of Isabela Island are important feeding areas and probable breeding areas for the Galapagos Martin, but these were largely excluded from the survey in 2017 due to logistical reasons. Historical and recent nesting sites include Tagus Cove on Isabela Island and Daphne Major Island. During our 2017 count, three possible new nesting sites were discovered: Daphne Minor, Santiago and a small crater on Punta Cristobal on southwestern Isabela Island. From 2015 to 2018, 15 nests were also observed on the cliff in Tagus Cove. Two accessible nests were collected and revealed the first records of Philornis downsi in Galapagos Martin nests. The impact of parasitism by P. downsi is unknown but potentially severe.

  abstract = {Tree height is an important variable in forest inventory programs but is typically time-consuming and costly to measure in the field using conventional techniques. Airborne light detection and ranging (lidar) provides individual tree height measurements that are highly correlated with field-derived measurements, but the imprecision of conventional field techniques does not allow for definitive assessments regarding the absolute accuracy of lidar tree height measurements and the relative influence of beam divergence setting (i.e., laser footprint size), species type, and digital terrain model (DTM) error on the accuracy of height measurements. In this study, we developed a methodology for acquiring accurate individual tree height measurements ({$<$}2 cm error) using a total station survey and used these measurements to establish the expected accuracy of lidar- and field-derived tree height measurements for two of the most ecologically and commercially significant species in western North America, Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) and ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa). Tree height measurements obtained from narrow-beam (0.33 m), high-density (6 points/m2) lidar were more accurate (mean error ± SD = –0.73 ± 0.43 m) than those obtained from wide-beam (0.8 m) lidar (–1.12 ± 0.56 m). Lidar-derived height measurements were more accurate for ponderosa pine (–0.43 ± 0.13 m) than for Douglas-fir (–1.05 ± 0.41 m) at the narrow beam setting. Although tree heights acquired using conventional field techniques (–0.27 ± 0.27 m) were more accurate than those obtained using lidar (–0.73 ± 0.43 m for narrow beam setting), this difference will likely be offset by the wider coverage and cost efficiencies afforded by lidar-based forest survey.},

We compared direct (i.e., spotlighting from road transects) and indirect (i.e., counting pellets on randomly placed transects) distance-sampling techniques for estimating deer densities in east-central Illinois, southern Illinois, and northern Michigan (USA) during 2007-2008. Density estimates (95\% CI) from indirect distance sampling for northern Michigan, east-central Illinois, and southern Illinois were 6.1-12.7 deer/km(2), 11.2-15.8 deer/km(2), and 15.4 deer/km(2), respectively. Density estimates from direct distance sampling for northern Michigan, east-central Illinois, and southern Illinois were 18.3-25.2 deer/km(2), 14.4-18.1 deer/km(2), and 19.0 deer/km(2), respectively. Although density estimates did not differ between techniques in east-central Illinois and southern Illinois, density estimates derived by direct sampling were slightly higher than those derived by indirect sampling. Estimates of density from direct distance sampling were higher than indirect distance sampling in northern Michigan. The difference in estimates among study areas may be due to landscape-specific differences in the behavioral response of deer to roads and the representativeness of road transects. In landscapes containing more agriculture, roads tend to be systematically distributed and forest edges are independent of road placement, which may explain why both distance-sampling methods provided similar results in Illinois. However, in more forested landscapes such as Michigan, roads tend to follow streams and may provide forest edges that are relatively scarce on the landscape. Deer in forested landscapes may be attracted to roadsides, resulting in higher density estimates not indicative of surrounding forested areas. Therefore, use of road transects for direct distance sampling may be more applicable in non-forested landscapes. (C) 2012 The Wildlife Society.},

Distance sampling methods can be used to correct for detectability, but in rainforest, where dense vegetation and diverse assemblages complicate sampling, information is lacking about factors affecting their application. Rare species present an additional challenge, as data may be too sparse to fit detection functions. We present analyses of distance sampling data collected for a diverse tropical rainforest bird assemblage across broad elevational and latitudinal gradients in North Queensland, Australia. Using audio and visual detections, we assessed the influence of various factors on Effective Strip Width (ESW), an intuitively useful parameter, since it can be used to calculate an estimate of density from count data. Body size and species exerted the most important influence on ESW, with larger species detectable over greater distances than smaller species. Secondarily, wet weather and high shrub density decreased ESW for most species. ESW for several species also differed between summer and winter, possibly due to seasonal differences in calling behavior. Distance sampling proved logistically intensive in these environments, but large differences in ESW between species confirmed the need to correct for detection probability to obtain accurate density estimates. Our results suggest an evidence-based approach to controlling for factors influencing detectability, and avenues for further work including modeling detectability as a function of species characteristics such as body size and call characteristics. Such models may be useful in developing a calibration for non-distance sampling data and for estimating detectability of rare species.},

Intensive monitoring of its demographic and genetic status is necessary. We examined the demographic and genetic structure of a small hog deer population in Keibul Lamjao National Park (KLNP), located on the western fringe of the IndoBurma biodiversity hotspot for conservation planning. The distribution pattern of hog deer in the Park was derived based on the presence/absence of faecal pellets in 1 km x 1 km grids. We used double-observer distance sampling method to derive the hog deer abundance and population structure and compared with previous data to derive the population trend. We determined the genetic diversity of the population through microsatellite screening and bottleneck detection. The overall pellet density was 0.34 +/- 0.02 pellets km(-2) restricted to only 22.34 +/- 0.20 km(2) area of the park. The estimated density of the deer in the park was 1.82-4.32 individuals km-2. The population showed a declining trend from 2006-08 (p ¡ 0.05, R-2 = 0.916) with 8\% annum(-1) and an increasing trend from 2003-2018 (p ¡ 0.05, R-2 = 0.9304) with 10\% annum(-1). The adult male-to-female ratio and fawn-to-doe ratio were 36.2 +/- 1.9 males per 100 females and 16.5 +/- 0.4 fawns per 100 females, respectively. The molecular examination suggested that the mean number of alleles at 23 loci was 2.70 +/- 0.18, the observed heterozygosity (Ho) ranged from 0.26 to 0.63 (mean 0.42 +/- 0.02), the expected heterozygosity (He) ranged from 0.23 to 0.73 (chi = 0.51 +/- 0.03), and the polymorphic information content (PIC) ranged from 0.2 to 0.67 (chi = 0.43 +/- 0.03) indicating a moderate level of genetic diversity. Although no bottleneck in the population was observed, the loss of genetic diversity may affect the evolutionary potential of the species at the site by limiting the selection flexibility.

  abstract = {Despite sea turtles in Papua New Guinea being culturally important and heavily harvested, no in-country density estimates have been previously established. We provide the first estimates of sea turtle density in Papua New Guinea from two locations around Mussau Island where turtle consumption is banned due to religious beliefs. We obtained density estimates using a low-cost, in-water distance sampling method. Our monitoring shows that the island has a high density of sea turtles (almost exclusively Chelonia mydas). At Lolieng, a site with a steep reef drop off, we recorded a mean of 7.4 turtles haÀ1 (s.d. ¼ 2.6) at the reef crest during low tide (across all sampling occasions), which is comparable to high density sites globally. By comparison, we recorded a much lower estimate of 1.1 turtles haÀ1 (s.d. ¼ 0.4) at Nae, a site with an extensive, low profile reef system. Additionally, our modelling shows that tidal cycle is an essential covariate for assessing sea turtle density for in-water distance sampling. We advocate that Papua New Guinea needs to invest in longterm monitoring at a national scale to track the sustainability of this important cultural resource, and that in-water distance sampling is a low cost monitoring method that potentially could be used for this purpose albeit subject to certain caveats.},

  abstract = {Question Could we better estimate plot species richness by asking several botanists to survey the same plots and using non-parametric estimators of richness? Location Two French deciduous forests. Methods Using replicated, independent censuses made by 11 professional botanists on the same eight 100-m(2) forest plots, the relative performance of different richness estimators (Lincoln-Petersen, Jackknife 1\&2, Chao 1\&2, Bootstrap, Chao Mth, Darroch) and the variation in their performance with the number of botanists involved (teams with two to eight botanists) were investigated. The sensitivity of these estimators to the presence of misidentifications in the data was also assessed. Results When misidentifications are removed, Chao Mth estimators converged fastest to true richness, but none of the tested estimators correctly accounted for differences in exhaustiveness between the teams. Finally, all estimators were highly sensitive to misidentifications. Conclusions Richness estimators are of little help in the presence of misidentifications and are ineffective at removing between-team discrepancies, thus strongly limiting their usefulness in practice. Methods are presented to show how surveys can be designed to remove misidentifications and limit between-team discrepancies. A sensible sampling design for 100-m(2) plots in temperate forests would involve triplets of botanists and correcting data with the Chao N1. Pairs of botanists would already significantly improve the richness estimates, but such estimates would still be biased low. However, further research is needed to design new richness estimators that are more robust to observer effects.},

The variability in management costs across candidate sites for protection therefore should inform conservation planning. For example, when considering whether to accept a donation of a property, a conservation organisation must determine whether an adequate endowment is available to fund future management activities. We examine variation in management costs across 78 small protected areas in the UK that are managed by a conservation NGO, the Yorkshire Wildlife Trust. Management costs exceed acquisition costs when funded on an endowment basis and are not correlated with acquisition costs or with proxy measures for conservation costs commonly relied upon in conservation planning studies. A combination of geographic, ecological and socioeconomic characteristics of sites explains 50\% of the variation in management costs. Site area is the most important determinant of management costs, which demonstrate economies of scale; implementing conservation management on an additional hectare adjacent to a larger protected area would incur a lower cost than doing the same adjacent to a smaller site. In evidencing this effect of site area, we avoid problems of spurious correlation that confound previous studies. Protected areas that encompass a greater richness of priority habitats for conservation also require more expensive management. Conservation organisations may have little option but to create small protected areas to conserve biodiversity in highly fragmented landscapes, but the decision to do so should take account of the greater cost burden that small protected areas incur.

With a single-scan setup, there will be a nondetection of trees in a plot and the representation of the individual trees will be incomplete. We explore how stand-level volume estimates, based on the single-scan mode, perform compared with standard inventory estimates. We base our study on 166 plots in 12 mature stands dominated by Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) and Norway spruce (Picea abies L. Karst) in southern Norway. First, we compare individual-tree volume estimates from TLS with estimates from volume functions and measurements from harvesters. We show that individual-tree volumes can be estimated with high precision and accuracy with TLS in single-scan mode. Secondly, we test three approaches for correction of nondetection relying on model-based estimates of the detection probability obtained by point transect sampling estimators. We show that all three approaches adjust for nondetection and yield stand-level volume estimates that are similar to those obtained by fixed-area sampling. In conclusion, our results indicate that stand-level volume estimates, based on single-scan mode TLS data, perform well compared with standard inventory estimates.},

  abstract = {Context. West African crocodylian populations are declining and in need of conservation action. Surveys and other monitoring methods are critical components of crocodile conservation programs; however, surveys are often hindered by logistical, financial and detectability constraints. Increasingly used in wildlife monitoring programs, drones can enhance monitoring and conservation efficacy. Aims. This study aimed to determine a standard drone crocodylian survey protocol and evaluate the drones as a tool to survey the diverse crocodylian assemblage of West Africa. Methods. We surveyed crocodile populations in Benin, Cote d'Ivoire, and Niger in 2017 and 2018, by using the DJI Phantom 4 Pro drone and via traditional diurnal and nocturnal spotlight surveys. We used a series of test flights to first evaluate the impact of drones on crocodylian behaviour and determine standard flight parameters that optimise detectability. We then, consecutively, implemented the three survey methods at 23 sites to compare the efficacy of drones against traditional crocodylian survey methods. Key results. Crocodylus suchus can be closely approached (¿10 m altitude) and consumer-grade drones do not elicit flight responses in West African large mammals and birds at altitudes of ¿40-60 m. Altitude and other flight parameters did not affect detectability, because high-resolution photos allowed accurate counting. Observer experience, field conditions (e.g. wind, sun reflection), and site characteristics (e.g. vegetation, homogeneity) all significantly affected detectability. Drone-based crocodylian surveys should be implemented from 40 m altitude in the first third of the day. Comparing survey methods, drones performed better than did traditional diurnal surveys but worse than standard nocturnal spotlight counts. The latter not only detected more individuals, but also a greater size-class diversity. However, drone surveys provide advantages over traditional methods, including precise size estimation, less disturbance, and the ability to cover greater and more remote areas. Drone survey photos allow for repeatable and quantifiable habitat assessments, detection of encroachment and other illegal activities, and leave a permanent record. Conclusions. Overall, drones offer a valuable and cost-effective alternative for surveying crocodylian populations with compelling secondary benefits, although they may not be suitable in all cases and for all species. Implications. We propose a standardised and optimised protocol for drone-based crocodylian surveys that could be used for sustainable conservation programs of crocodylians in West Africa and globally.},

  abstract = {Fire is a natural disturbance process that shapes ecosystems worldwide and influences the distribution of many species of plants and animals. In fire-prone regions, planning for both fire management and biodiversity conservation requires a sound understanding of fire history and spatial patterns. However, in many fire-prone areas, accurate fire records and systematic fire maps are lacking. We used Landsat imagery to map the fire history of the Murray Mallee region of southeastern Australia from 1972 to 2007. Our study in this semi-arid, fire-prone ecosystem encompassed an area of 104,000 km2. An area equivalent to 40\% of the tree-mallee vegetation (vegetation characterised by small, multi-stemmed eucalypts) was burnt during the 35-year period, but less than 3\% of tree-mallee experienced more than one fire in this time. Large fires ({$>$}10,000 ha) accounted for 89\% of the area burnt, and were the main influence on the distribution of fire age-classes in conservation reserves. Different vegetation types burned disproportionately, illustrating the value of combining region-wide vegetation mapping with fire history mapping. Although the perception is that large fires occur on an approximately decadal cycle following years of above-average rainfall, our analyses revealed that above-average rainfall is not the only influence on large fires. The distribution of fire age-classes differed between reserves and across states, highlighting the need to manage fire-prone landscapes at ecologically meaningful regional-scales that cross jurisdictional boundaries. Systematic and consistent mapping of fires in fire-prone regions is an essential foundation for improved fire management and more effective landscape planning for conservation.},

This study investigated the methods, intensity, and driving factors of tiger and prey poaching in the Sundarbans Reserved Forest of Bangladesh, to help better design and direct future management interventions. The study identified a range of snaring methods used to catch prey and an approach to killing tigers by poisoning prey carcasses with a Carbofuran pesticide. We recorded six poisoned baits set to kill tigers and 1427 snare loops in 56 snare sets to kill tiger prey. With an average of 23 snare loops/snare set, this is equivalent to an estimated 6268 snare loops across the Sundarbans or 147 snare loops/100 km(2). Poachers selected sites that tended to be away from guard posts, and close to river banks, but were not influenced by protected area status or distance to the forest boundary. The current poaching pressure is likely to have contributed to a recent decline in relative tiger abundance. We recommend using better regulation of Carbofuran use across tiger range countries, and using remote camera traps set up around snares and poisoned baits to help authorities identify poachers for arrest. This study demonstrates a simple approach to investigating the methods, intensity and distribution of poaching, that could be replicated across all tiger landscapes to better direct mitigating actions and monitor changes in threat levels over time.

  abstract = {Raw count data are often used to estimate bird population densities. However, such data do not consider detection probability. As an alternative, methods that model detection probability such as distance-sampling have been proposed. However, standard distance-sampling provides reliable estimates for absolute density only when the underlying assumptions are met. One of the most critical of these assumptions is that animals on a transect line or at an observation point have to be detected with certainty (the g(0) = 1 assumption). We radiotagged nine Orphean Warblers Sylvia hortensis and estimated their short-distance detection probability. Birds were radio-located in 264 cases in single bushes or trees. Their visual detection probability after a 5-min search was only 0.58 (sd = ±0.14, range = 0.38–0.80), although the observer knew the bird's location. Furthermore, we carried out a literature review to assess how the g(0) = 1 assumption is handled in practice. None of the 28 standard distance-sampling papers reviewed contained an estimation of g(0). In 57\% of the papers, the g(0) = 1 assumption was not even mentioned. Nevertheless, none of the authors declared their estimates as being relative. Our empirical data show that the g(0) = 1 assumption would be severely violated for a foliage-gleaning bird species at a desert stopover site outside the breeding season. The literature review revealed that the testing of the g(0) = 1 assumption is largely ignored in practice. We strongly suggest that more attention should be paid to the testing of this key assumption, because results may not be reliable when it is violated. If it is not possible to test the g(0) = 1 assumption or g(0) is less than 1, alternative methods should be used. Another possibility is to estimate detection probability by the means of radiotagged individuals.},

Officials typically blame pikas for causing the degraded conditions, whereas studies increasingly suggest that sparse vegetation encourages population growth and high densities of pikas. Correlational investigations that document pika density while simultaneously describing grassland conditions can quantify this association, but are uninformative regarding causation. We used livestock exclosures and pika reductions in partially controlled experiments to examine how pika habitat use responds to changes in vegetation structure caused by wintertime livestock grazing. Mean counts of pikas were higher on grazed than ungrazed plots. Linear models accounting for experimental pika reduction as well as seasonal phenology indicated that grazing significantly increased pika use compared with ungrazed plots. These results show that moderate livestock density is likely consistent with both biodiversity conservation and economic activity, and that high pika populations alone are not responsible for observed degradation of the QTP alpine grasslands. Moderate levels of livestock grazing and pika presence are consistent with maintaining the integrity of the alpine steppe ecosystem of the QTP.},

Furthermore, there was no indication of differential habitat association among morphs.

Here, we assume that the occurrence of the population in the sample site follows a distributional count pattern. We use the Horvitz-Thompson estimator for the formation of the estimation process. We provide simulated results and an example using tiger census data to illustrate the proposed estimation procedure, and compare it with estimates obtained from a commonly used method known as the simple random sampling (SRS). The results show that the mean squared error (MSE) of the proposed method is lower than that of the SRS and the statistical test also shows a good result in favour of the proposed method. Our method of estimation also shows very good outcome for smaller sample sizes compare to the SRS. As well, this method is flexible in application and also very inexpensive in both time and cost.},

  abstract = {Count-based indices and distance sampling are widely used to monitor primate populations. Indices are often confounded by variation in detectability, whereas distance sampling is generally ineffective with species that flee or hide from observers and where it is difficult to accurately measure detection distances. We tested occupancy modeling as a means to monitor Sclater's monkey (Cercopithecus sclateri), an endemic of Nigeria. We evaluated effects of survey methodology, habitat, and human disturbance on detection probability and site occupancy. Average detectability was high (p = 0.81), but varied substantially between two observers. Occupancy was highest in areas with intermediate levels (20-40\%) of farmland and secondary forest, and was unaffected by human disturbance. Sampling plots (4 and 6.25 ha) did not concurrently contain ¿ 1 monkey group, were likely closed to monkey movements during the replicate surveys of each plot, and were spatially separated so that it was unlikely the same group was observed in ¿ 1 plot. These conditions enabled the conversion of occupancy to group density. Scaled to 6.25 ha, model-weighted occupancy averaged 0.230 (SE 0.103), yielding an estimate of 3.7 groups/km(2) (95\% CI 1.4-7.7 groups/km(2)). Because some groups straddled plot boundaries, we assumed that half of these groups were inside the plots, resulting in an adjusted estimate of 3.1 groups/km(2). Our results illustrate that occupancy can be suitable for monitoring vigilant forest primates where detection distances are difficult to measure. However, special attention is required to choose spatial and temporal scales that accommodate the method's closure and independent-detection assumptions.},

  abstract = {Ongoing marine monitoring programs are seldom designed to detect changes in the environment between different years, mainly due to the high number of samples required for a sufficient statistical precision. We here show that pooling over time (time integration) of seasonal measurements provides an efficient method of reducing variability, thereby improving the precision and power in detecting inter-annual differences. Such data from weekly environmental sensor profiles at 21 stations in the northern Bothnian Sea was used in a cost-precision spatio-temporal allocation model. Time-integrated averages for six different variables over 6 months from a rather heterogeneous area showed low variability between stations (coefficient of variation, CV, range of 0.6-12.4\%) compared to variability between stations in a single day (CV range 2.4-88.6\%), or variability over time for a single station (CV range 0.4-110.7\%). Reduced sampling frequency from weekly to approximately monthly sampling did not change the results markedly, whereas lower frequency differed more from results with weekly sampling. With monthly sampling, high precision and power of estimates could therefore be achieved with a low number of stations. With input of cost factors like ship time, labor, and analyses, the model can predict the cost for a given required precision in the time-integrated average of each variable by optimizing sampling allocation. A following power analysis can provide information on minimum sample size to detect differences between years with a required power. Alternatively, the model can predict the precision of annual means for the included variables when the program has a pre-defined budget. Use of time-integrated results from sampling stations with different areal coverage and environmental heterogeneity can thus be an efficient strategy to detect environmental differences between single years, as well as a long-term temporal trend. Use of the presented allocation model will then help to minimize the cost and effort of a monitoring program.},

However, determining the survey effort required to reliably detect population change can be challenging for rare, cryptic and elusive species. We used a tropical bromeliad-dwelling frog as a model system to explore a cost-effective sampling design that optimizes the chances of detecting a population decline. Relatively few sampling visits were needed to estimate occupancy and detectability with good precision, and to detect a 30\% change in occupancy with 80\% power. Detectability was influenced by observer expertise, which therefore also had an effect on the sampling design -less experienced observers require more sampling visits to detect the species. Even when the sampling design provides precise parameter estimates, only moderate to large changes in occupancy will be detected with reliable power. Detecting a population change of 15\% or less requires a large number of sites to be surveyed, which might be unachievable for range-restricted species occurring at relatively few sites. Unless there is high initial occupancy, rare and cryptic species will be particularly challenging when it comes to detecting small population changes. This may be a particular issue for long-term monitoring of amphibians which often display low detectability and wide natural fluctuations.},

The overall detection probability, i.e., the probability that a nest was detected by at least one observer, was 0.856.

Although the most likely model was a one with a constant nest detection probability, a constrained model with observer dependent nest detection probability had substantial support.

  abstract = {The primary and accepted method used to estimate seabird densities at sea from ships is the strip transect method, designed to correct for the effect of random directional bird movement relative to that of the ship. However, this method relies on the critical assumption that all of the birds within the survey strip are detected. We used the distance sampling method from line-transects to estimate detection probability of a number of species of flying seabirds, and to test whether distance from the ship and bird body size affected detectability. Detection probability decreased from 0.987 (SE=0.029) to 0.269 (SE=0.035) with increasing strip half-width from 100 to 1400 m. Detection probability also varied between size-groups of species with strip half-width. For all size-groups, this probability was close to 1 for strip half-width of 100 m, but was 0.869 (SE=0.115), 0.725 (SE=0.096) and 0.693 (SE=0.091) for strip half-width of 300 m, a typical strip width used in seabird surveys, for respectively large, medium and small size flying seabirds. For larger strip half-width, detection probability was higher for large sized species, intermediate for medium sized species and lower for smaller sized species. For strip half-width larger than 100 m we suggest that more attention should be paid to testing the assumption of perfect detectability, because abundance estimates may be underestimated when this assumption is violated. Finally, the effect of the speed of travel of flying seabird on the detection probability was estimated in a simulation study, which suggests that detection probability was underestimated with increasing flying speed.},

  abstract = {Reliable population estimates are needed for the conservation management of seabird populations. Failing to account for detection probability in surveys often leads to underestimate population size and, if detection probability varies among surveys, to bias the estimated trends. This is particularly relevant for storm petrels, which are widespread small burrow- or cavity-nesting seabirds, which have low detection probabilities on land and at sea and whose population status and trends are the least known among seabirds. Here, we used the distance sampling method to estimate detection probability and breeding population size of the cavity-nesting Wilson's Storm Petrel (Oceanites oceanicus) in the Pointe G,ologie archipelago, East Antarctica. Detection probability was 0.353 +/- 0.053 and the average density of active nests was 45.53 +/- 15.63 nests/ha. The proportion of nests occupied by breeders was estimated using an endoscope on a sample of nests and was 0.455 +/- 0.053. The breeding population was estimated to be 793 (95\% CI 344-1359) breeding pairs in January 2016. We advocate the distance sampling method as a robust approach to estimate abundance of breeding Wilson's Storm Petrels in Antarctica. Comparison with an earlier survey suggests that the population has decreased over the past 30 years, possibly partly due to a reduction in nesting habitat following the extension of the surface area occupied by penguin colonies.},

We evaluated line transect sampling methodology, using track and cross-county transects, and assessed its conformity to underlying assumptions for use in estimating density of chiru in the ca 2,300 km2 Aru Basin, Tibet. Although violations of some assumptions were apparent, they were generally not substantial, and simple adjustments of sampling design can reduce their effects in future surveys. Sampling effort was not sufficient to demonstrate clear seasonal differences in chiru density between summer and autumn. However, cross-country transects on the west side of the study area did show a statistically significant higher autumn than summer density, and encounter rates (the number of detections per km) were significantly higher for both transect types in autumn. We tested for an expected negative bias associated with track transects, and although a clear difference in estimated density was not found, a significantly higher encounter rate was present for cross-country than for track transects. With increased sampling effort and a more effective design in future surveys, line transect sampling will be a useful methodology for assessment of chiru pop­ ulations.},

  abstract = {Reliable methods to estimate species richness are very important to managers and conservationists because they provide key data to make the right decisions in conservation programmes. In the case of carnivore mammals, traditional methods, such as direct count censuses, are not useful since these animals are usually scarce, elusive and nocturnal. Difficulties in carnivore sampling are compounded when monitoring programmes are developed at large spatial scales, where high economic costs and field efforts are necessary to achieve reliable richness or abundance estimates. These problems have highlighted the need to find more effective carnivore survey methods, especially in regions with high rates of landscape change, such as the Mediterranean basin. The present study, performed in a typical Mediterranean area, was the first in Europe to test simultaneously the relative efficiencies of four broad-applied sampling methods to detect carnivore species at large spatial scales. Sign surveys based on scat detection, scent stations, camera-trapping and live-trapping were investigated. We compared efficiencies using biological parameters and by considering both the logistic and economic costs of each method. Overall, scent stations and sign surveys were the most efficient methods both in economic and logistic terms. In addition, the use of scent stations may be necessary to detect species rarely detected by scats. Detailed and extensive training programmes for conducting sign surveys and scent stations may overcome perceived problems thus enhancing the widespread use of both methods. Our results are applicable not only to other Mediterranean areas, but also to other habitats and regions of the world. More research into the suitability of these and other methods in relation to different landscapes, seasons and species is required.},

While, many studies have described faunal populations such as birds across forest-agricultural landscapes, they generally note minor changes in total species richness and more significant changes in species composition. Few studies, however, consider faunal diversity among secondary forests of different management history, such as manual restoration or natural revegetation. In this study, we surveyed bird communities in three forest sites of varying restoration and natural revegetation treatments in a tropical urban-agricultural landscape in the Ecuadorian Amazon. Our sites include manually restored and naturally revegetating forest of 20-40 years since clearing. We found that a diverse assemblage of birds visit and occupy forest fragments within the urban- agricultural landscape, including two IUCN-listed near-threatened species. Bird species richness was similar across sites of different management history; species composition varied only slightly, but differences existed in presence and occupancy for forest-dependent groups, such as large frugivores and forest insectivores. In the manually restored site, bird diversity may have been limited by under-developed forest structure, but we were unable to isolate the effects of patch size and landscape matrix. We suggest that future restoration activities consider forest structure in addition to plant species diversity when attempting to restore faunal populations, and that future studies take heed of landscape and matrix parameters when evaluating restoration projects.},

Such an investment requires a quantitative monitoring approach that allows for the effectiveness of the expenditure to be determined. By combining criminological deterrence theory and spatially explicit field-ranger patrol monitoring, we develop a framework to measure the presence of field-rangers in the landscape. We test this framework empirically by comparing the presence of field-rangers in the landscape against the presence around 40 rhino poaching incidents. We empirically demonstrate that the analysed field ranger human resources and their deployment in a well-staffed protected area in Africa did not deter rhino poachers.},

  abstract = {Surveys of colonial-nesting waterbirds are needed to assess population trends and gain insight into the health of wetland ecosystems. Use of unmanned aerial systems (UAS) for such surveys has increased over the past decade, but possible sources of bias in surveys conducted with UAS have not been examined. We examined possible visibility biases associated with using a UAS to survey waterbird colonies in cypress-tupelo watersheds and coastal island habitats in Texas in 2016. We used known numbers of four waterbird decoy types, including Black Skimmers (Rynchops niger), terns, and white- and dark-plumaged herons, to estimate their detectability in each habitat. Six observers independently counted decoys from aerial imagery mosaics taken with a consumer-grade, off-the-shelf quadcopter drone. We used generalized linear mixed-effects models to estimate detection probabilities of each decoy type. Black Skimmers at the coastal island had a detection probability of just 53\%. Detectability of both white- and dark-plumaged herons was lower in the canopied cypress-tupelo habitat than the coastal island. In addition, cloud cover ¿ 50\% further reduced detectability of white heron decoys in cypress-tupelo habitat. Use of the double-count method yielded biased-low abundance estimates for white- and dark-plumaged herons in canopied sites, suggesting that habitat differences were a greater source of bias than observer error. Black Skimmers were the only decoy type to be imperfectly detected at the coastal island, a surprising result given the stark contrast of their plumage with their sand and shell nesting substrate. Our results indicate that UAS-derived photographic surveys are prone to low detection probabilities at sites where vegetation occludes nests. In habitats without canopy, however, UAS surveys show promise for obtaining accurate counts of terns, white herons, and dark herons.},

Ideally, a method should be applicable over a wide range of situations, such as differing abundances or habitat types. Comparisons of methods are required to evaluate the benefits of each of them, and survey methods should be validated for the conditions in which they will be used. In this study, we compare the performance of direct methods (kilometric abundance index and distance sampling) in two seasons and at two times of day (dusk and night) for estimating wild rabbit abundances in agricultural landscapes. Estimates based on direct methods were highly correlated and detected similar seasonal population changes. Night counts provided better estimates than did dusk counts and exhibited more precision. Results are discussed within the context of rabbit behaviour and their implications for rabbit population surveys.},

  abstract = {Traditional monitoring approaches may have the objective of gathering data to estimate population size for a given species, but often lack the context of hypothesis testing. As such, many natural areas managers (responsible for ecological monitoring) and scientists have shared little common ground. The goal of monitoring should be to inform managers so that they can insure that the species, communities, and ecosystems under their charge are able to persist in the face of stressors, often from anthropogenic sources. The inherent complexity of natural systems makes this a daunting task, a task that requires a renewed partnership between managers and conservation biologists. The non-equilibrium paradigm of population dynamics establishes a theoretical framework for shifting monitoring objectives from only population estimates to understanding the processes that drive the dynamics of those populations. Using a hypothesis-driven scientific approach, monitoring designs can embrace the scientific method, provide insights into the ecological processes at work within natural systems, and importantly, point directly to if, when, and how active management may need to be employed in order to prevent the loss of biodiversity. This approach provides a common ground for conservation biologists and natural areas managers to forge partnerships to better understand the complexity of ecological systems and our ability to sustain those systems for future generations.},

  abstract = {Several authors have recently discussed the problems with using index methods to estimate trends in population size. Some have expressed the view that index methods should virtually never be used. Others have responded by defending index methods and questioning whether better alternatives exist. We suggest that index methods are often a cost-effective component of valid wildlife monitoring but that double-sampling or another procedure that corrects for bias or establishes bounds on bias is essential. The common assertion that index methods require constant detection rates for trend estimation is mathematically incorrect; the requirement is no long-term trend in detection “ratios” (index result/parameter of interest), a requirement that is probably approximately met by many well-designed index surveys. We urge that more attention be given to defining bird density rigorously and in ways useful to managers. Once this is done, 4 sources of bias in density estimates may be distinguished: coverage, closure, surplus birds, and detection rates. Distance, double-observer, and removal methods do not reduce bias due to coverage, closure, or surplus birds. These methods may yield unbiased estimates of the number of birds present at the time of the survey, but only if their required assumptions are met, which we doubt occurs very often in practice. Double-sampling, in contrast, produces unbiased density estimates if the plots are randomly selected and estimates on the intensive surveys are unbiased. More work is needed, however, to determine the feasibility of double-sampling in different populations and habitats. We believe the tension that has developed over appropriate survey methods can best be resolved through increased appreciation of the mathematical aspects of indices, especially the effects of bias, and through studies in which candidate methods are evaluated against known numbers determined through intensive surveys.},

  abstract = {We present a method for estimating density of nesting birds based on double sampling. The approach involves surveying a large sample of plots using a rapid method such as uncorrected point counts, variable circular plot counts, or the recently suggested double-observer method. A subsample of those plots is also surveyed using intensive methods to determine actual density. The ratio of the mean count on those plots (using the rapid method) to the mean actual density (as determined by the intensive searches) is used to adjust results from the rapid method. The approach works well when results from the rapid method are highly correlated with actual density. We illustrate the method with three years of shorebird surveys from the tundra in northern Alaska. In the rapid method, surveyors covered similar to10 ha h(-1) and surveyed each plot a single time. The intensive surveys involved three thorough searches, required similar to3 h ha(-1), and took 20\% of the study effort. Surveyors using the rapid method detected an average of 79\% of birds present. That detection ratio was used to convert the index obtained in the rapid method into an essentially unbiased estimate of density. Trends estimated from several years of data would also be essentially unbiased. Other advantages of double sampling are that (1) the rapid method can be changed as new methods become available, (2) domains can be compared even if detection rates differ, (3) total population size can be estimated, and (4) valuable ancillary information (e.g. nest success) can be obtained on intensive plots with little additional effort. We suggest that double sampling be used to test the assumption that rapid methods, such as variable circular plot and double-observer methods, yield density estimates that are essentially unbiased. The feasibility of implementing double sampling in a range of habitats needs to be evaluated.},

  abstract = {The recovery of forests following stand-replacing disturbance is of widespread interest; however, there is both a lack of definitional clarity for the term ‘‘recovery” and a dearth of empirical data on the rates of forest recovery associated with different disturbance types. We conducted a quantitative review of literature to determine recovery times following wildfire and timber harvest and to evaluate variation in recovery rates across Canada’s diverse forest ecosystems. Recovery was assessed according to the rate of change associated with certain forest structural attributes that have traditionally been used as indicators of forest growth and productivity. The recovery of forest canopy cover, tree height, and stand basal area varied at rates that depended on disturbance type, forest biome, and ecozone. We found that, on average, it took 5–10 years, depending on factors such as location and species, for most forest ecosystems of Canada to attain a benchmark canopy cover of 10\% after wildfire or harvest. Similarly, regenerating stands in Canada’s boreal forests were capable of attaining average heights of 5 m within five to ten years after wildfire or harvest. Stands in the Boreal Plains ecozone post-harvest reached stand basal area, benchmarked at 10 m2 haÀ1, faster than those in the Boreal Shield, attributable to differences in tree species composition and the rich mineral deposits of the Boreal Plains. Overall, recovery of canopy cover, tree height, and stand basal area was similar or more rapid following wildfire than harvest. Our review provides temporal benchmarks for gauging recovery times after disturbance. Building upon these temporal benchmarks, and conditioned by disturbance type, site conditions, and location, we present opportunities for using dense time series of remotely sensed data to inform on regional and national trends in forest recovery following disturbance.},

  abstract = {Reliable estimates of trends in population size are critical to effective management of landbirds. We propose a standard for considering that landbird populations are adequately monitored: 80\% power to detect a 50\% decline occurring within 20 years, using a 2-tailed test and a significance level of 0.10, and incorporating effects of potential bias. Our standard also requires that at least two-thirds of the target region be covered by the monitoring program. We recommend that the standard be achieved for species' entire ranges or for any area one-third the size of the temperate portions of Canada and the United States, whichever is smaller. We applied our approach to North American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) data. At present, potential annual bias for the BBS is estimated at +/-0.008. Further, the BBS achieves the monitoring standard for only about 42\% of landbirds for which the BBS is considered the most effective monitoring approach. Achieving the proposed monitoring target for greater than or equal to80\% of these species would require increasing the number of BBS-or similar survey-routes by several-fold, a goal that probably is impractical. We suggest several methods for reducing potential bias and argue that if our methods are implemented, potential bias would fall to +/-0.003. The required number of BBS or similar routes would then be 5,106, about 40\% more than in the current BBS program. Most of the needed increases are in 15 states or provinces. Developing a comprehensive landbird monitoring program will require increased support for coordination of the BBS (currently 2 people) and new programs for species that are poorly covered at present. Our results provide a quantitative goal for long-term landbird monitoring and identify the sample sizes needed, within each state and province, to achieve the monitoring goal for most of the roughly 300 landbird species that are well suited to monitoring with the BBS and similar surveys.},

The goal was to design a sampling plan for detecting change in the density of breeding birds of 6 species occurring along the Colorado River around and south of Lake Mead in the southwestern United States. The main problem in designing the study was that the focal species were concentrated in small, irregularly shaped patches of habitat. We partitioned the study area into ¿15,000 plots configured to enclose the high-quality habitat in the fewest possible plots with the constraint that plots could be surveyed in 1 morning by 1 person. Because of the irregular plot shapes and extremely dense vegetation, we used area searches to carry out the surveys. We used double-sampling, including a large sample of plots surveyed with a rapid method and a subsample of plots surveyed intensively, to estimate detection ratios. A simulation study helped allocate effort between rapid and intensive surveys and indicated that conducting 80 surveys per year would achieve high power to detect a 50\% decline occurring during 20 years. This is one of the first studies to show how large landscapes can be sampled using small-scale stratification so that effort can be concentrated in the habitats of greatest interest.

Generalized linear models were used to determine relationships between presence and densities of birds to water depth, vegetation characteristics, and relative forage fish and invertebrate abundances at two spatial scales. American Bittern (Botaurus lentiginosus) and Pied-billed Grebe (Podilymbus podiceps) densities were positively influenced by water depth and relative fish abundance.

Densities of Sora (Porzana carolina) and Virginia Rail (Rallus limicola) were positively correlated with the relative abundances of invertebrates, but negatively correlated with relative fish abundance. Due to the high avian biodiversity in the region, managers should focus on providing a variety of wetland habitats. Using a combination of partial water-level drawdowns and high water, habitat for numerous avian species can be created simultaneously within wetland complexes.

Data Sources Search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, Current Contents, and full-text journal content databases to identify truncated RCTs up to January 2007; search of MEDLINE, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects to identify systematic reviews from which individual RCTs were extracted up to January 2008. Study Selection Selected studies were RCTs reported as having stopped early for benefit and matching nontruncated RCTs from systematic reviews. Independent reviewers with medical content expertise, working blinded to trial results, judged the eligibility of the nontruncated RCTs based on their similarity to the truncated RCTs. Data Extraction Reviewers with methodological expertise conducted data extraction independently. Results The analysis included 91 truncated RCTs asking 63 different questions and 424 matching nontruncated RCTs. The pooled ratio of relative risks in truncated RCTs vs matching nontruncated RCTs was 0.71 (95\% confidence interval, 0.65-0.77). This difference was independent of the presence of a statistical stopping rule and the methodological quality of the studies as assessed by allocation concealment and blinding. Large differences in treatment effect size between truncated and nontruncated RCTs (ratio of relative risks Ͻ0.75) occurred with truncated RCTs having fewer than 500 events. In 39 of the 63 questions (62\%), the pooled effects of the nontruncated RCTs failed to demonstrate significant benefit. Conclusions Truncated RCTs were associated with greater effect sizes than RCTs not stopped early. This difference was independent of the presence of statistical stopping rules and was greatest in smaller studies.},

In the case of the eastern stock of Atlantic bluefin tuna (ABFT), recent changes in management policies have strongly affected the reliability of fishery-dependent indicators due to drastic changes in fishing season/area, fisheries selectivity and strategy. However, fishery-independent indices of abundance are rare for large pelagic fish, and obtaining them is often costly and labor intensive. Here, we show that scientific aerial surveys are an appropriate tool for monitoring juvenile bluefin tuna abundance in the Mediterranean. We present an abundance index based on 62 aerial surveys conducted since 2000, using 2 statistical approaches to deal with the sampling strategy: line and strip transects. Both approaches showed a significant increase in juvenile ABFT abundance in recent years, resulting from the recovery plan established in 2007. Nonetheless, the estimates from the line transect method appear to be more robust and stable. This study provides essential information for fisheries management. Expanding the spatial coverage to other nursery grounds would further increase the reliability and representativeness of this index.},

Increasing the number of species monitored improves robustness of the program towards meeting monitoring objectives. In addition, monitoring at multiple spatial scales should increase the sensitivity of the monitoring program. We developed a monitoring program using unbiased estimates of occupancy at both local and regional scales, and unbiased estimates of density for multiple species of birds with a single protocol. We used transects for sampling similar to 1,000-ha pastures that consisted of twelve 200-m radius sampling points. We conducted 10-min point counts and recorded distance to each observation using two independent observers, and resampled each of 30 transects over two study sites in South Texas, for a total of four visits in each of 2015 and 2016. We estimated occupancy at two scales using the multiscale model in Program MARK and estimated density using the Distance package in R. We predicted that it would be possible to detect a 50\% decline over 25 y with a power of 0.90 in regional occupancy, local occupancy, and density for 36, 37, and 30 species, respectively, on our larger study site, and for 29, 33, and 12 species, respectively, on our smaller study site using two independent observers and four visits. Our work shows it is possible to monitor numerous species within a complex bird assemblage with a simple field protocol. For those interested in implementing a long-term monitoring program that is sensitive to a wide range of potential stressors at local and regional scales, we suggest considering multiscale occupancy and density monitoring for multiple species of birds.},

Our objective was to determine whether broadcasting conspecific and heterospecific calls (broadcast surveys) would increase p of raptor species compared to passive surveys. This comparison was accomplished by estimating p during both types of surveys using a multiscale occupancy framework. We conducted 8400 surveys for Cooper's Hawk (Accipiter cooperii), Swainson's Hawk (Buteo swainsoni), White-tailed Hawk (Geranoaetus albicaudatus), Harris's Hawk (Parabuteo unicinctus), Red-tailed Hawk (Buteo jamaicensis), and Great Horned Owl (Bubo virginianus) in 2015 and 2016 in south Texas. We conducted 10-min passive surveys in both years, 10-min broadcast surveys in 2015 including calls from each of the target hawk species, and 10-min broadcast surveys in 2016 using calls from Great Horned Owls. Our results suggest that p is improved with multiple-hawk broadcast surveys (0.16, SE 0.04) over passive surveys (0.04, SE 0.02) for Harris's Hawks; p was not affected in broadcast surveys for the other hawk species considered. Great Horned Owls had a higher p during broadcast surveys using Great Horned Owl calls (0.35, SE 0.04) than during passive surveys (0.19, SE 0.02). Our results do not support the use of broadcast surveys to improve the detection probability of multiple species of hawks. However, our results do indicate that using broadcast surveys for occupancy studies focused on Harris's Hawks or Great Horned Owls should significantly reduce the effort required over passive surveys, resulting in improved power and reduced costs.},

Using an information theoretic argument we derive a measure PD for the effective number of parameters in a model as the difference between the posterior mean of the deviance and the deviance at the posterior means of the parameters of interest. In general PD approximately corresponds to the trace of the product of Fisher's information and the posterior covariance, which in normal models is the trace of the 'hat' matrix projecting observations onto fitted values. Its properties in exponential families are explored. The posterior mean deviance is suggested as a Bayesian measure of fit or adequacy, and the contributions of individual observations to the fit and complexity can give rise to a diagnostic plot of deviance residuals against leverages. Adding PD to the posterior mean deviance gives a deviance information criterion for comparing models, which is related to other information criteria and has an approximate decision theoretic justification. The procedure is illustrated in some examples, and comparisons are drawn with alternative Bayesian and classical proposals. Throughout it is emphasized that the quantities required are trivial to compute in a Markov chain Monte Carlo analysis.},

Little is known about how avian communities in these STAs compare to those present on other similar land types. In 2008-2009, point counts were conducted seasonally in the STAs, nearby croplands, and natural Everglades marsh to compare avian communities among these habitats. Overall, avian densities were nearly three times greater in STAs than in the croplands and 38 times greater than in the natural marsh. Local species richness in the STAs was 78\% greater than in croplands and nearly four times greater than in the natural marsh. Although natural marshes may have more structural complexity than the croplands and STAs, their oligotrophic status probably limits their ability to support a large bird community. Avian densities varied seasonally among habitat types; avian density was greatest in the winter in STAs as a result of high densities of migratory waterfowl. The STAs may be providing wintering habitat to a significant portion of the North American waterfowl population, including as much as 8\% of the breeding population of American Coots (Fulica americana). If the trend of increasing numbers of treatment wetlands continues, it has the potential to alter the distribution of wetland birds, a group that has previously suffered population declines because of habitat loss.},

  abstract = {Detecting occupied sites of rare species, and estimating the probability that all occupied sites are known within a given area, are desired outcomes for many ecological or conservation projects. Examples include managing all occupied sites of a threatened species or eradicating an emerging invader. Occupied sites may remain undetected because (1) sites where the species potentially occurs had not been searched, and (2) the species could have been overlooked in the searched sites. For rare species, available data are typically scant, making it difficult to predict sites where the species probably occurs or to estimate detection probability in the searched sites. Using the critically endangered Rose's mountain toadlet (Capensibufo rosei), known from only two localities, we outline an iterative process aimed at estimating the probability that any unknown occupied sites remain and maximizing the chance of finding them. This includes fitting a species distribution model to guide sampling effort, testing model accuracy and sampling efficacy using the occurrence of more common proxy species, and estimating detection probability using sites of known presence. The final estimate of the probability that all occupied sites were found incorporates the uncertainties of uneven distribution, relative area searched, and detection probability. Our results show that very few occupied sites of C. rosei are likely to remain undetected. We also show that the probability of an undetected occupied site remaining will always be high for large unsearched areas of potential occurrence, but can be low for smaller areas intended for targeted management interventions. Our approach is especially useful for assessing uncertainty in species occurrences, planning the required search effort needed to reduce probability of unknown occurrence to desired levels, and identifying priority areas for further searches or management interventions.},

Although several species of cetaceans are known to inhabit these productive waters, quantitative assessments of their abundance and distribution patterns are scarce and patchy. Here, we present the first abundance and distribution estimates for fin whale (               Balaenoptera physalus               ), southeast Pacific blue whales (               Balaenoptera musculus               ), sperm whale (               Physeter macrocephalus               ), dusky dolphin (               Lagenorhynchus obscurus               ), and common dolphin (               Delphinus               spp.) in the entire Chilean portion of the HCE.

Group counts were modelled as a function of environmental variables using single step Bayesian Binomial N-mixture model (BNMM), which allows full uncertainty propagation between model components. By using spatially explicit predictions of cetacean densities and observed vessel densities in the HCE, we provide quantitative assessments on the relative probability of cetaceans encountering vessels (RPCEV). Dusky dolphin and fin whale showed the largest distribution overlap with industrial and artisanal~fishery fleets. Our results highlight areas where effort should be prioritized to address the extant but unquantified negative interactions between vessels and cetaceans in Chilean HCE.},

Mountain hares (Lepus timidus scoticus) were surveyed during 2017–2021 using 830 km of line transects in the Peak District National Park, England. Historically degraded bog areas were previously reported having low hare numbers. Following bog restoration, we found hare densities of 32.6 individuals km−2, notably higher than neighboring degraded (unrestored) bog with 24.4 hares km−2. Hare density on restored peatland was 2.7 times higher than on bogs managed for grouse shooting at 12.2 hares km−2 and 3.3 times higher than on heather moorland managed for grouse shooting at 10.0 hares km−2. Yearly estimates varied most on habitats managed for grouse, perhaps indicative of the impact of habitat management, for example, heather burning and/or possible hare culling to control potential tick-borne louping ill virus in gamebirds. Acid grassland used for sheep farming had a similar density to grouse moorland at 11.8 hares km−2. Unmanaged dwarf shrub heath had the lowest density at 4.8 hares km−2. Hare populations are characterized by significant yearly fluctuations, those in the study area increasing by 60\% between 2017 and 2018 before declining by ca. 15\% by 2020 and remaining stable to 2021. During an earlier survey in 2002, total abundance throughout the Peak District National Park was estimated at 3361 (95\% CI: 2431–4612) hares. The present study estimated 3562 (2291–5624) hares suggesting a stable population over the last two decades despite fluctuations likely influenced by weather and anthropogenic factors. Mountain hares in the Peak District favored bog habitats and were associated with restored peatland habitat. Wildlife management should be cognizant of hare density variation between habitats, which may have implications for local extinction risk.},

We conducted monthly raptor surveys from February 2007 to May 2009 in adjacent areas of the Texas Southern High Plains (USA) that do and do not support lesser prairie-chickens (Tympanuchus pallidicinctus), a candidate for protection under the Endangered Species Act. During the summer period corresponding to prairie-chicken nesting and brood-rearing, Swainson's hawks (Buteo swainsoni) were the most abundant raptor. During the lekking and overwintering period, the raptor community was diverse, with northern harriers (Circus cyaneus) being the most abundant species. Raptor abundance peaked during the early autumn and was lowest during the spring. Utility poles were a significant predictor of raptor density at survey points and Swainson's hawks and all raptors, pooled, were found in greater densities in non-prairie-chicken habitat dominated by mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa). Avian predation risk on prairie-chickens, based on presence and abundance of raptors, appears to be greatest during winter when there is a more abundant and diverse raptor community, and in areas with utility poles.

The methods used to estimate the abundance of this group of dogs are more complex than the ones used with domiciled owned dogs. In this systematic review, we analyze the techniques and the results obtained in studies that seek to estimate the size of free-ranging dog populations. Twenty-six studies were reviewed regarding the quality of execution and their capacity to generate valid estimates. Seven of the eight publications that take a simple count of the animal population did not consider the different probabilities of animal detection; only one study used methods based on distances; twelve relied on capture-recapture models for closed populations without considering heterogeneities in capture probabilities; six studies applied their own methods with different potential and limitations. Potential sources of bias in the studies were related to the inadequate description or implementation of animal capturing or viewing procedures and to inadequacies in the identification and registration of dogs. Thus, there was a predominance of estimates with low validity. Abundance and density estimates carried high variability, and all studies identified a greater number of male dogs. We point to enhancements necessary for the implementation of future studies and to potential updates and revisions to the recommendations of the World Health Organization with respect to the estimation of free-ranging dog populations.},

  abstract = {Context. Helicopter-based shooting has been widely used to harvest deer or control overabundant populations in Australasia, but the effectiveness and cost of this method as a deer control tool has seldom been evaluated. Aims. We evaluated the effectiveness and costs of helicopter-based shooting of fallow deer (Dama dama) and chital deer (Axis axis) in eastern Australia by quantifying (1) reductions in density, (2) the relationship between numbers killed per hour and deer density (i.e. the functional response), (3) the costs of control and (4) the effort–outcome and cost–outcome relationships. Methods. We evaluated the costs and effectiveness of 12 aerial shooting operations aiming to reduce fallow deer (n = 8) or chital deer (n = 4) population densities at nine sites in eastern Australia. Sites were characterised by fragmented woodland, and all but one operation aimed to reduce grazing competition with livestock. We used precontrol population density estimates and operational monitoring data to estimate the costs and outcomes of each operation. We combined data from all operations to estimate the relationship between shooting effort and population reduction, as well as costs associated with different levels of effort. Key results. Population reductions for operations ranged from 5\% to 75\% for fallow deer, and from 48\% to 88\% for chital deer. The greatest population reductions occurred when effort per unit area was greatest, and the largest reductions in deer density occurred when shooting was conducted in consecutive years. The functional response of hourly kills to deer density was best described by a modified Ivlev model, with the asymptotic kill rate estimated to be 50 deer per hour. There was no support for the existence of a prey refuge, that is, a threshold population density below which no deer could be shot. Helicopter charter was the primary cost of helicopter-based shooting programs, followed by labour; firearm and ammunition costs were relatively minor. Conclusions. Helicopter-based shooting can rapidly reduce deer populations over large geographic areas, but the magnitude of the reduction depends on the effort (hours of shooting) per deer per km2. Implications. Aerial shooting operations should include a pre-control population survey so that (1) measurable objectives can be established, (2) the likely level of effort and cost required for objectives to be met can be estimated and planned for, and (3) the realised population reduction can be estimated.},

  abstract = {Non-native species can affect food web and community structure, including the flow of resources from one habitat to another. In many streams of western North America, non-native brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) have replaced native cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarkii). Because brook trout naturally occur at higher densities and exhibit different feeding habits, this replacement may have consequences for a range of organisms in stream-riparian food webs. We conducted a large-scale, 2-month field experiment to test whether, compared with cutthroat trout, brook trout reduce benthic insects, cause an increase in stream algae, and reduce emerging adult aquatic insects as well as riparian spiders that rely on emergence as prey. Twenty enclosed reaches from which trout were removed were treated by adding age-1 and older: (i) cutthroat trout at natural density (0.15fishm(-2)); (ii) brook trout at a natural density (0.40fishm(-2)); (iii) brook trout at a low density equal to the cutthroat trout treatment (0.15fishm(-2)) or (iv) no trout added. Brook trout reduced the flux of emerging insects by 55\% compared with cutthroat trout, but, surprisingly, only at the lower density. This reduction in emergent insects was predicted to reduce spider abundance by 20\%, provided that sufficient branches were available to support riparian spider webs. We also detected an effect of trout on large-bodied benthic and emerging insects, but not on the entire assemblage of benthic insects, or periphyton. We hypothesise that our results were influenced by trout foraging behaviour mediated by their density and size structure. Regardless of the mechanisms responsible, our results indicate that non-native brook trout can reduce the flux of emerging insects, and further analysis showed that this could reduce riparian spiders and birds that prey on them. Similar effects of non-native fish are likely to occur in lotic and lentic waters beyond the western United States.},

We combined distance sampling (DS) of roe deer dung pellet groups with multiple variables to develop a density surface model (DSM) in the federal state of Bavaria in south-eastern Germany. We used the estimates of pellet group density as a proxy for roe deer relative abundance. We extrapolated our best DSM, conducted a quantitative evaluation and contrasted relative abundance along climate and land-use gradients. Relative abundance of roe deer was influenced by a combination of habitat type, climate and wildlife management variables, which differed between seasons and which reflected changes in food and shelter availability. At the landscape scale, the highest abundance was observed in agriculture-dominated areas and the lowest in urban areas. Higher abundance was also observed in areas with intermediate temperatures compared to the warmest areas. Our results provide information on possible future changes in the distribution of relative abundance due to changes in climate and land-use.},

  abstract = {Replacement of a native species by a nonnative can have strong effects on ecosystem function, such as altering nutrient cycling or disturbance frequency. Replacements may cause shifts in ecosystem function because nonnatives establish at different biomass, or because they differ from native species in traits like foraging behavior. However, no studies have compared effects of wholesale replacement of a native by a nonnative species on subsidies that support consumers in adjacent habitats, nor quantified the magnitude of these effects. We examined whether streams invaded by nonnative brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) in two regions of the Rocky Mountains, USA, produced fewer emerging adult aquatic insects compared to paired streams with native cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarkii), and whether riparian spiders that depend on these prey were less abundant along streams with lower total insect emergence. As predicted, emergence density was 36\% lower from streams with the nonnative fish. Biomass of brook trout was higher than the cutthroat trout they replaced, but even after accounting for this difference, emergence was 24\% lower from brook trout streams. More riparian spiders were counted along streams with greater total emergence across the water surface. Based on these results, we predicted that brook trout replacement would result in 6-20\% fewer spiders in the two regions. When brook trout replace cutthroat trout, they reduce cross-habitat resource subsidies and alter ecosystem function in stream-riparian food webs, not only owing to increased biomass but also because traits apparently differ from native cutthroat trout.},

  abstract = {Free-ranging domestic cats are a detriment to wildlife and humans by preying on native species and transmitting disease. As a result, removing free-ranging cats from the landscape has become a conservation and public health priority. Estimating cat population size with an unbiased sampling design, however, especially in human-dominated areas, is logistically challenging and rarely done. The lack of robust cat population sampling limits our understanding of where cats pose risks, which is important for evaluating management strategies, such as trap-remove or trap-neuter-return. We hypothesized that cat abundance and activity both depend on human land use and demographics. Using a network of sites participating in a community science program, we conducted transect and camera trap surveys to test predictions of cat population abundance and activity across a gradient of residential land use intensity. Both sampling methods determined that cat abundance was greatest in areas with intermediate human population density and lower educational attainment. Transect data also provided evidence that cat abundance was greatest at intermediate levels of impervious surface cover (e.g., road and buildings), while data from camera traps also showed that cat abundance was positively associated with household income. Using counts of cats observed on cameras, we found that the timing of cat activity varied depending on the degree of urban intensity. Cats were more strictly nocturnal in medium and high intensity residential land-use areas, possibly because a greater proportion of these cats are unowned or because they avoid human activity. These results suggest that transect surveys conducted during the day may undercount cats in urban environments where unowned free-ranging cats predominate. Taken together, our results highlight the importance of incorporating human demographics, land use patterns, and urban context in estimating the abundance of free-ranging cats to better inform management decisions and improve conservation outcomes.},

Despite this rise and the potential of hair samples for ecology and conservation studies, the relative performance of hair collection devices has been rarely tested. Here, we compare the effectiveness of five types of hair traps for brown bears Ursus arctos in the Carpathian Mountains (SE Poland) and test the effects of trap type, season, number of days elapsed since trap installation and trap features on the trapping success in order to provide recommendations for optimal sampling in future studies. The trap types were corral, path-trap, “smola” (beechwood tar) tree-trap, turpentine tree-trap and natural rub. In 2010, we collected 858 hair samples during 2330 inspections of 175 hair traps and found that the most effective traps were smola tree-traps (mean percentage of successful inspections +/- SD: 30.2\% +/- 26.0) and natural rubs (50.8\% +/- 16.7). Based on this finding, over the following 2 years we focused on 24 smola tree-traps and eight natural rubs. During this long-term survey (2010-2012, 969 inspections, 1322 samples collected) the trapping success increased with time and smola tree-traps achieved similar effectiveness to natural rubs (45.5\% +/- 29.7 and 45.9 +/- 23.4, respectively). We show that when baiting smola tree-traps ten weeks prior to research or monitoring, sampling effectiveness can reach up to 30\%. Taking into account the logistical and methodological constraints associated with detecting and using natural rubs for a proper survey design, we recommend using smola tree-traps baited in advance for hair sampling in wildlife studies.}

  abstract = {No-take marine reserves are increasingly popular tools for conservation and fisheries management. While much attention has been paid to evaluating the effects of design aspects (size, location, etc.) in achieving reserve objectives, less emphasis has been placed on the role of stakeholder compliance. Therefore, the first aim of this study was to evaluate the state of compliance literature and examine the methods used to measure compliance in reserves. The state of compliance literature is limited, although publications with compliance information have increased sixfold in the last decade. However, most studies containing compliance information (63\%) fail to provide quantitative estimates. Furthermore, most (95\%) quantitative estimates of compliance were reported using a single method, which is problematic because each method has biases and limited applicability. Methods used to indicate compliance include (i) direct observation; (ii) indirect observation; (iii) law enforcement records; (iv) direct questioning; (v) expert opinion; and (vi) modelling. Our second aim was to empirically demonstrate the critical role of compliance in reserve outcomes by comparing a mixed-effects model on compliance data synthesized from 63 marine reserves to that of a null model. The model of best fit demonstrated a negative relationship between non-compliance and target species biomass response ratios. Thus, without incorporating any aspects of reserve design, compliance data predicted reserve response ratios of fish biomass. Accordingly, researchers should explore ways to better understand and measure non-compliance. Therefore, future research should triangulate multiple sources of quantitative compliance data collected using standardized techniques and conduct baseline surveys before reserve implementation.},

  abstract = {Underwater visual census (UVC) is one of the more frequently used methods for monitoring of subtidal fish communities. However, population estimates from UVC are plagued by numerous biases that ultimately reduce the diagnostic power of the data. Adaptations to methods that account for detection errors by employing multiple observers can reduce many of these biases, but have received little consideration in past marine research. In the terrestrial environment the double-observer method has been successfully applied to estimate visibility bias, observer bias and detection probabilities. We used an independent double-observer method to measure the influence of observer type (volunteers and researchers) and fish community structure on the detection probability and count dissimilarity between two observers simultaneously surveying the same transect. Community data collected by volunteers were of a consistently lower quality than that collected by researchers. However, this was not the case for the dominant species for which researchers and volunteers produced similar data. The analysis further suggested that rare species contributed disproportionately to the bias in UVC data because the abundance of a species within a survey area determined its detection probability. Our results highlight the need to account for detection probability during UVC and it is recommended that future research based on UVC integrates an independent double-observer approach. Furthermore, the results indicate that care needs to be taken when designing monitoring programmes as allowing inexperienced volunteers to participate can undermine the integrity of the data.

However, data are still largely unavailable for many taxa, including sea snakes, which appear to be facing global declines. Here, we present the first quantitative abundance and density estimates for the geographically isolated sea snake Hydrophis platurus xanthos endemic to the inner basin of Golfo Dulce, Costa Rica. Using systematic distance sampling methods, we obtained and analyzed 199 snake detections from 46 transect lines covering the entire known distribution (totaling nine days and 469~km of effort). Our modeling methods accounted for (i) the probability of detecting a snake given it was available to be detected (ii) the average availability of snakes at the water surface during a 24-hr cycle, and (iii) the by-hour variance in the taxon’s activity pattern. The best estimate of population abundance was 29781 individuals (95\% CI=20104–44115) with an estimated density of 76 snakes/km2. Without historical abundance estimates or minimum viable population size, it is unknown whether this number represents a healthy population. However, with all individuals inhabiting a relatively small inlet increasingly exposed to anthropogenic impacts, the long-term persistence of H. p. xanthos may be threatened by ongoing impacts (boat propeller strikes, agricultural runoff, and climate change), as well as unforeseen events in the future.},

In this paper we (1) determine the frequency and usage trends of different point count summary statistics in recent ornithological literature, and (2) assess how well point count data, summarized using five common statistics, predict an alternate measure of habitat quality-reproductive activity. For the 100 journal years we reviewed (10 journals over 10 years), 148 papers used point counts to evaluate bird habitat relationships. The number of papers using point counts has increased over the decade. Mean abundance, the most common summary statistic, was used more than twice as frequently as the next most common summary statistics. Only 25.7\% (38 papers) provided a justification for use of a particular summary technique. We conducted point counts in three Canadian study regions (New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, and Newfoundland and Labrador) comprised of two ecosystem types (forest and grassland). While there was a statistically significant positive correlation between point count data and reproductive activity data for most species, we found that point counts were often unsuccessful at predicting reproductive activity in forest birds. For species where point counts adequately predicted reproductive activity mean abundance and frequency were consistently the best predictors. Our results indicate that statistics using information on intra-season (multiple-visit) occupancy tend to be better estimators of reproductive activity.},

  abstract = {1. Sound conservation and management advice usually requires spatial data on animal and plant abundances. The expense of programmes to determine species distributions and estimates of population sizes often limits sample size. To maximise effectiveness at minimal costs, optimisations of such monitoring efforts are critical. A monitoring programme can have multiple objectives with demands on the optimal sampling design that are often in conflict. Here, we develop an optimal sampling design for monitoring programmes with conflicting objectives, building on an existing intertidal benthic monitoring programme in the Dutch Wadden Sea and simulation models bounded in their parameter spaces by these data. 2. We distinguish three possible objectives: (1) estimation of temporal changes and spatial differences in abundance and (2) mapping, that is, prediction of abundances at unsampled locations. Mapping abundances requires model-based analyses using autocorrelation models. Such analyses are as good as the model fits the data; therefore, the final objective was (3) accurately estimating model autocorrelation parameters. To compare sampling designs, we used the following criteria: (1) minimum detectable difference in mean between two time periods or two areas, (2) mean prediction error and (3) estimation bias of autocorrelation parameters. 3. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we compared five sampling designs with respect to these criteria (i.e. simple random, grid, two types of transects, and grid with random replacements) at four levels of naturally occurring spatial autocorrelation. 4. The ideal sampling design for objectives (1) and (2) was grid sampling and for objective (3) random sampling. The sampling design that catered best for all three objectives combined was grid sampling with a number of random samples placed on gridlines. 5. Grid sampling with a number of random samples is considered an accurate and powerful tool with the highest effectiveness. This sampling design is widely applicable and allows for accurate estimates of population sizes, monitoring of population trends, comparisons of populations/trends between years or areas, modelling autocorrelation, mapping species distributions and a mechanistic understanding of species distribution processes.},

  abstract = {Maximising survey efficiency can help reduce the tradeoff between spending limited conservation resources on identifying population changes and responding to those changes through management. Burrow-nesting seabirds are particularly challenging to survey because nests cannot be counted directly. We evaluated a stratified random survey design for generating unbiased population estimates simultaneously for four petrel species nesting on Macquarie Island, Australia, where the survey cue, burrow entrances, is similar for all species. We also compared the use of design-based and model-based analyses for minimising uncertainty in estimates. We recorded 2845 Antarctic prion burrows, 306 white-headed petrel burrows and two blue petrel burrows while distance-sampling along 154 km of transects. For blue petrels and grey petrels, we completed nocturnal searches along a further 71 km and searched 249 km of tracks during follow-up ground searches. We failed to generate unbiased population estimates for two rare and localised species, blue and grey petrels, from our stratified random survey. Only for the most widespread and abundant species, Antarctic prion, did the estimate have reasonable power to detect a rapid population change. Model-based analyses of the stratified random survey data did not improve upon traditional design-based analyses in terms of uncertainty in population estimates, but they did provide useful spatial representation of current populations. Models that used the targeted survey data did not reflect current population sizes and distributions of the two rare and localised species. We found that when species ecologies, distributions and abundances vary, a multi-method approach to surveys is needed. Species with low abundance that occur patchily across large islands are likely to be best estimated using targeted surveys, whereas widespread and abundant species can be accurately and precisely estimated from randomised surveys using informative model-based analyses.},

Given the prevalence of such habitats and the potential benefit for conservation of biodiversity, it is, important to understand patterns of diversity in second growth and old growth. Descriptions of species-distribution patterns may depend, however, on method(s) used to sample birds. We used data from mist nets and point counts to (1) describe species diversity and community composition in second-growth (young and old) and old-growth forests at La Selva Biological Station, Costa Rica; and (2) to evaluate perspectives on community composition provided by the two methods. We recorded 249 species from 39 families, including 196 species captured in mist nets (10,019 captures) and 215 recorded during point counts (15,577 observations), which represents similar to 78\% of the terrestrial avifauna known from La Selva (excluding accidentals and birds characteristic of aquatic or aerial habitats). There were 32 threatened species, 22 elevational migrants, and 40 latitudinal migrants. Species richness based on rarefaction analyses of capture and count data) was greatest in the youngest site. Latitudinal migrants were particularly common in second growth; elevational migrants were present in both young and old forest, but M ere more important in old-growth forest. Several threatened species common in second growth were not found in old-growth forests. Trophic composition varied less among sites than did species composition Mist nets and point counts differed in numbers and types of species detected. Counts detected more species that nets in old-growth forest, but not in young second growth Mist nets detected 62\% of the terrestrial avifauna, and point counts detected 6830. Fifty-three species were observed but not cap tu red, and 31 species were captured but not observed. Six families were not represented by mistnet captures. Data from mist nets and point counts both support the conclusion that second-growth vegetation provides habitat for many species.},

Roughly 16,000 ha of filter strips have been established in Maryland through the United States Department of Agriculture's Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program. Filter strips often represent the only uncultivated herbaceous areas on farmland in Maryland and therefore may be important habitat for early-successional bird species. Most filter strips in Maryland are planted to either native warm-season grasses or cool-season grasses and range in width from 10.7 m to 91.4 m. From 2004 to 2007 we studied the breeding and wintering bird communities in filter strips adjacent to wooded edges and non-buffered field edges and the effect that grass type and width of filter strips had on bird community composition. We used 5 bird community metrics (total bird density, species richness, scrub-shrub bird density, grassland bird density, and total avian conservation value), species-specific densities, nest densities, and nest survival estimates to assess the habitat value of filter strips for birds. Breeding and wintering bird community metrics were greater in filter strips than in non-buffered field edges but did not differ between cool-season and warm-season grass filter strips. Most breeding bird community metrics were negatively related to the percent cover of orchardgrass (Dactylis glomerata) in ¿= 1 yr. Breeding bird density was greater in narrow (¡30 m) compared to wide (¿60 m) filter strips. Our results suggest that narrow filter strips adjacent to wooded edges can provide habitat for many bird species but that wide filter strips provide better habitat for grassland birds, particularly obligate grassland species. If bird conservation is an objective, avoid planting orchardgrass in filter strips and reduce or eliminate orchardgrass from filter strips through management practices.

  abstract = {Populations of greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) are monitored using counts of males displaying on breeding leks (lek counts). When count-based indices are used to assess population growth (), an implicit assumption is that detection is constant through time and space. If detection depends on breeding behavior, annual variation in the proportion of individuals that attend a breeding site may lead to a violation of this assumption. We used 8 years of banding data from male sage-grouse in eastern Nevada and capture-mark-recapture analyses to evaluate how temporary absence of males from lek sites during a given year may influence estimates of population trends derived from lek counts. We estimated the proportion of variance in annual lek count trends that corresponded with an independent estimate of , versus variance associated with temporary absence. The probability a male sage-grouse attended 1 of our study leks at least once in a given year ranged from a low of 0.56 (+/- 0.22 SE) to a high of 0.87 (+/- 0.11 SE). Variance in annual lek count trends was associated with both realized (semipartial R-2=0.57), and sampling error associated with temporary absence (semipartial R-2=0.40). We found discrepancies between lek count and realized in 3 out of 7 intervals, whereas estimates of for the entire study interval were extremely similar between count-based and capture-mark-recapture methods (=0.90 +/- 0.05 SE and =0.91 +/- 0.05 SE, respectively). Temporary absence was influenced by male density during the previous year and associated with exotic grasslands surrounding leks, although some uncertainty was associated with this latter effect. Lek counts are well suited for estimating across multi-year intervals, whereas annual estimates of should be viewed cautiously if variation in annual lek attendance is not directly incorporated.

  abstract = {Transect surveys are frequently used to estimate distribution and abundance of species across a landscape, yet a proportion of individuals present will be missed because either they were out of view and unavailable for detection or they were available but not detected because the surveyors missed them. These situations lead to availability and perception bias, respectively, and can result in misleading estimates of abundance and habitat use. In this study, we examined potential biases of visual surveys used for the brown tree snake (Boiga irregularis), a cryptic invasive snake responsible for the extirpation of at least 15 vertebrates on Guam. We simultaneously executed visual surveys and radiotelemetry in a low-density population of brown tree snakes with two goals in mind: to assess the efficacy of visual surveys in detecting subjects at low densities and to identify sources of perception and availability bias in such surveys. Results indicated that with considerable effort, visual surveys can predict the presence of this cryptic reptile even at low densities (0.4 animals/ha) but perform poorly at predicting areas of high use resulting in inaccurate estimates of relative habitat importance. Telemetered snakes used densely foliated plants including Pandanus tectorius and ferns (epiphytic and terrestrial species) for nearly half of their time, yet ¡9\% of visual survey observations occurred in these microhabitats. Visibility of snakes decreased as they perched higher in the canopy mirroring the disparity between visual survey and telemetry detections but was also surprisingly low near the forest floor (0-1 m). Microhabitats identified in this study are likely to disproportionately affect visual surveys and would be appropriate resources to target for management purposes. When there is critical need to prevent false negatives, such as during an incipient invasion elsewhere, targeted searches of high-use resources could augment other detection tools to improve detection probabilities of this and other cryptic species.},

We assessed the feasibility of using both ARUs and point-count surveys to monitor Black Rails (Laterallus jamaicensis) and Least Bitterns (Ixobrychus exilis), two secretive marsh birds of conservation concern. We identified vocalizations in ARU recordings using acoustic analysis software, and combined these observations with those from point counts to model occupancy of both species in coastal marshes of eastern North Carolina in 2016 and 2017 while accounting for variation in detection. Use of ARUs doubled the number of points where we detected Black Rails; thus, the combined point count-ARU model yielded a greater occupancy probability for this species. However, the ARUs recorded few Least Bittern vocalizations, suggesting that successful application of ARUs may depend on the vocal complexity of focal species. Although the appropriateness of integrating ARUs with in-person monitoring varies among species, our results illustrate that this integration increased detections of an elusive species of conservation concern.},

  abstract = {Abstract: There has been a dramatic increase in the number of conservation organizations worldwide. It is now common for multiple organizations to operate in the same landscape in pursuit of different conservation goals. New objectives, such as maintenance of ecosystem services, will attract additional funding and new organizations to conservation. Systematic conservation planning helps in the design of spatially explicit management actions that optimally conserve multiple landscape features (e.g., species, ecosystems, or ecosystem services). But the methods used in its application implicitly assume that a single actor implements the optimal plan. We investigated how organizational behavior and conservation outcomes are affected by the presence of autonomous implementing organizations with different objectives. We used simulation models and game theory to explore how alternative behaviors (e.g., organizations acting independently or explicitly cooperating) affected an organization's ability to protect their feature of interest, and investigated how the distribution of features in the landscape influenced organizations’ attitudes toward cooperation. Features with highly correlated spatial distributions, although typically considered an opportunity for mutually beneficial conservation planning, can lead to organizational interactions that result in lower levels of protection. These detrimental outcomes can be avoided by organizations that cooperate when acquiring land. Nevertheless, for cooperative purchases to benefit both organizations’ objectives, each must forgo the protection of land parcels that they would consider to be of high conservation value. Transaction costs incurred during cooperation and the sources of conservation funding could facilitate or hinder cooperative behavior.},

  abstract = {Forests provide an array of services ranging from forest products to greenhouse gas absorption. The reliability and appropriateness of management decisions concerning ecosystem services and resources are directly correlated with the accuracy and extent of the available information on forests and related dynamics. Historically, forest resource management activities informed by decision support systems, have largely relied on field measurements, often with sparse geographical, temporal, and ecological coverage. In contrast, remotely-sensed data can provide dense temporal coverage over large areas. Landsat data in particular have spatial and temporal characteristics well-suited to capturing forest changes on the landscape. Since 2008 free and open access to analysis-ready data representing more than 40 years of data in the Landsat archive has created new opportunities for forest monitoring. There is however, a need to link forest information generated from remotely-sensed data to the data input needs of decision support systems. Here, we develop such a linkage between field and remotely-sensed observations to characterize one of the main drivers of forest change: growth. The goal of this research is to produce above-ground biomass (AGB) change estimates that integrate the information of re-measured field plots and that of the Landsat time series. Over a large test area (\$3.3 Mha) in Saskatchewan, Canada, we demonstrate how information from a dense Landsat time series (1984–2012) can be used with a network of field plots to estimate change in AGB over the broad geographical, temporal, and ecological range of these forests. Our approach expands forest growth estimation both spatially and temporally, and results in information layers that are directly ingestible in decision support models. Our results show that trends match between the field plots and the remote-sensing-field-combined estimate, but that the more encompassing spatial estimates give more varied and lower average estimates of AGB change for our study region. We hypothesize that integrating both remotely-sensed information and repeated field measurements covers a wider range of ecological conditions, forest productivity, and forest developmental stages present on the landscape and through time than the field plots alone. The next step in our research is to integrate our findings into the forest resource management decision support tools, with the aim of increasingly spatializing what are usually spatially-referenced models. Our findings highlight emergent synergies between complementary data sources that foster the generation of new information products for forest resources management decision support.},

Yet, challenging terrain and survey costs hinder the collection of data needed to estimate absolute abundance or population densities for New Zealand's forest birds. Acoustic sampling is being used more frequently to increase efficiency in avian monitoring and paired sampling facilitates robust density estimation from acoustic data. In paired sampling. point counts are conducted simultaneously by human observers and autonomous recording units (ARU s) to allow estimation of statistical offsets that correct biases in ARU data relative to human observers. These offsets can then be used to calibrate count data collected only by ARUs in a larger sampling scheme. However, the effectiveness of paired sampling has not yet been evaluated in New Zealand. We assessed bias in bird counts from ARUs relative to traditional point counts and evaluated whether paired sampling reduced ARU bias, when present, at 280 count stations in six indigenous forest patches on the North Island from January to April 2017. For 13 forest bird species, we estimated delta a statistical offset that represents the ratio of the effective detection radius (EDR) of the ARU data to human count data and compared bias in density estimates from ARUs relative to human observers between models with and without delta offsets. We found that delta estimates of EDR ratios were near 1.0 and 95\% confidence intervals around delta overlapped 1.0 for nine of 13 species. Furthermore. densities produced by ARU counts were unbiased relative to human point counts for nine of 13 species. When models included delta offsets, ARU density estimate bias was removed for all species. Thus, paired acoustic sampling offers a promising strategy for increasing the efficiency, and spatial and temporal coverage of bird population monitoring across New Zealand.},

  abstract = {Homer S. Swingle was a pioneer in pond management and professor of fisheries at Auburn University. Results from his scientific research on the principles of fish interactions in lakes and ponds, and methods to improve fish production are used worldwide, and he is credited with improving lives of countless people by increasing the amount of food available to those in developing countries and providing recreational opportunities to a multitude of anglers. His advice was sought by US presidents, prime ministers, the United Nations and countries across the globe (Byrd 1973). His biological work was groundbreaking, yet there is little evidence that Homer Swingle used sampling procedures when conducting his work. His major works contain no reports of sampling error with his estimates (Swingle 1950, 1952) and his contemporaries have pointed out that he actively avoided subsampling in favor of census. His methods for enumerating a population were simple. At the conclusion of his pond experiments, he would census every fish involved, either by draining or treating the pond with piscicide (fish poison). Being a student on Swingle’s piscicide crew meant counting every dead fish as it floated to the water’s surface in the hot Alabama sun over a 3-day period. Those involved in the third-day pickup were the unluckiest, and often the least senior members of the crew—a smelly task indeed! While a complete census of all experimental or survey subjects provides the most complete information, few of us have the luxury of counting every subject in a population to estimate population characteristics. It simply costs too much, takes too much time, or is infeasible in some other way. Therefore we have to sample a portion of the population to estimate diversity or population parameters such as abundance. For example, a marine biologist estimating the number of clams in the Gulf of California cannot hope to count every one—he will expand an estimate calculated from a sample of plots. A plant biologist measuring the biomass of grasses in a field will not weigh every grass blade in the field—she will estimate the biomass through a sample of plots containing grass. A wildlife biologist will not count all mice in a national park to determine relative density of different species. Density will be determined by a subset of captures from different areas. To ensure the most useful information, a biologist must be familiar with basic sampling issues. Here we discuss some issues that all biologists should know when sampling diversity, abundance, or other parameters. Consideration of these issues allows the biologist to sample in a manner that, while not a perfect reflection of the population, will provide the best representation of the true population as possible.},

The second, monitoring, consists of repeated visits to these areas in order to prevent possible re-emergence. As detection probability may vary over time, the timing and number of monitoring visits can dramatically impact monitoring efficacy. We explore the optimal timing and number of monitoring visits, by focusing on one infested site. Our decision-analysis framework defines an optimal monitoring schedule which accounts for a time-dependent probability of detection, based on the presence/ absence of a flower. We use this framework to investigate the optimal monitoring schedule for Hieracium aurantiacum, an invasive species in the Australian Alps and many other countries. We also perform a sensitivity analysis to draw more general conclusions. For H. aurantiacum eight monitoring visits (compared to 12 visits in the current program) are sufficient to obtain a 99\% monitoring efficacy. When four or fewer visits to a site are allowed, it is optimal to visit during the high season, when the weed is likely to initiate flowering. Any extra visits should be scheduled in the early season, before the plants flower. The sensitivity analysis shows that increasing the detection probability early in the season has a greater impact than increasing it late in the season. An effective treatment method increases the value of site visits late in the season, when the detection probability is higher. Our decision-analysis framework can assist invasive species managers to reduce or reallocate management resources by determining the minimum number of monitoring visits required to satisfy an acceptable risk of re-emergence.},

In studies of bird environment relationships, the duration used for point counts varies considerably from one study to another. Short counting times may increase the number of false absences while long counting times increase the probability that birds initially absent immigrate during the counting period. This study aims to quantify the effect of point count duration on the performance of bird distribution models and on the estimated structure of the communities. We used a sample of 256 point counts collected in south western France and we compared four count durations (5, 10, 15 and 20 min). After comparing the predictive performance of seven statistical methods, we constructed one GAM (generalized additive model) per counting time to link the presence absence data of each species with seven landscape variables. We evaluated the models by examining explained deviance and by comparing predicted and observed values for an independent data using AUC (area under the curve) and TSS (true skill statistics). At the community level, we constructed one CQO (constrained quadratic ordination) per counting time, then we compared the species' scores along the latent environmental variables. For the 21 species studied, the overall performance of GAMs only improves very moderately with a lengthening of the counting time (mean D-2 = 25\% for 5 min and 28\% for 20 min; mean TSS = 0.40 for 5 min and 0.43 for 20 min), with an increase for some species and a decrease for others. The latent environmental variables of the four CQOs were associated with the same explanatory variables and the scores of the species along the latent variables were highly correlated (between 5 and 20 min, P ¡ 2.10(-16), rho = 0.99). In the perspective of building reliable bird distribution models, our results thus show that a point count duration of 5 min is sufficient in temperate regions such as France.},

Detection probabilities from fixed-wing aircraft in the Ingakslugwat Hills were similar to those from the helicopter in the Kilbuck Mountains for Gyrfalcons and Golden Eagles, but were higher for Common Ravens ((p) over cap = 0.85; SE 0.06) and Rough-legged Hawks ((p) over cap = 0.42; SE 0.07). Fixed-wing aircraft provided detection probability estimates and SEs in the Ingakslugwat Hills similar to or better than those from helicopter surveys in the Kilbucks and should be considered for future cliff:nesting raptor surveys where safe, low-altitude flight is possible. Overall, detection probability varied by observer experience and in some cases, by study area/aircraft type.},

  abstract = {Double-observer methodology requires independent collection of data to accurately estimate population parameters. Use of visual nest markers to facilitate matching, relocating, and monitoring nests as part of a double-observer study violates this assumption, but few reliable alternatives exist, especially when working with cryptic nests and high nest densities in homogeneous habitat. We used passive integrated transponder (PIT) tags to nonvisually mark the nests of ground-nesting birds at the Yukon Delta National Wildlife Refuge in western Alaska in a double-observer study of nest density. We marked 70 nests with PIT tags and naive observers subsequently detected tags at 44 of 50 re-scanned nests (88\% correct identification). Failed detections were likely due to either suboptimal tag orientation or tags falling through nest material, and such failures may be an inherent, but uncommon, feature of this nest-marking technique. PIT tags facilitated nest monitoring among independent observers, uniquely and reliably marked nests, provided a minimum of cues to potential nest predators, and allowed us to estimate densities in a double-observer framework while not violating assumptions. These tags should be useful in other studies of nesting birds where nonvisual, reliable nest markers are needed, and they provide a new tool for double-observer studies.},

  abstract = {Distance sampling methods assume that distances are known but in practice there are often errors in measuring them. These can have substantial impact on the bias and precision of distance sampling estimators. In this paper we develop methods that accommodate both systematic and stochastic measurement errors. We use the methods to estimate detection probability in two surveys with substantial measurement error. The first is a shipboard line transect survey in the North Sea in which information on measurement error comes from photographically measured distances to a subset of detections. The second is an aerial cue-counting survey off Iceland in which information on measurement error comes from pairs of independently estimated distances to a subset of detections. Different methods are required for measurement error estimation in the two cases. We investigate by simulation the properties of the new estimators and compare them to conventional estimators. They are found to perform better than conventional estimators in the presence of measurement error, more so in the case of cue-counting and point transect estimators than line transect estimators. An appendix on the asymptotic distributions of conditional and full likelihood estimators is available online.},

  abstract = {Autonomous sensors and automated analysis have great potential to reduce cost and increase efficacy of wildlife monitoring. By increasing sampling effort, autonomous sensors are powerful at detecting rare and elusive species such as the marbled murrelet (Brachyramphus marmoratus). New approaches must be tested for comparability to existing methodologies, so we compared the results of inland audio-visual and of automated acoustic monitoring for marbled murrelets, conducted during the 2010 breeding season, at 7 sites in the Santa Cruz Mountains, California, USA. We found automated acoustic surveys and analysis had fewer detections per morning compared with audio-visual surveyors, but the rate of automated acoustic detections per morning was positively and strongly correlated with the rate of audio-visual detections per mornings (r = 0.96, P {$<$} 0.01). Furthermore, acoustic monitoring sampled 10 times more mornings per site ({$<$}(x)over bar{$>$} = 48) than were monitored by human surveyors ((x) over bar = 4.4) at a comparable cost. We used resampling to estimate the power to detect murrelet presence with acoustic sensors at {$>$}80\% within 8 continuous days of recordings, even at low-activity sites. Our results suggest that autonomous sensor and automated analysis approaches could greatly increase the scale and efficacy of murrelet monitoring, allowing for more cost-effective surveying of large and remote areas of potential habitat, as well as, improved ability to measure changes in inland activity. Further study of passive acoustic recordings would be valuable to examine for acoustic signs of breeding phenology, and site occupancy, if acoustic surveys are to replace the utility of audio-visual surveys.

  abstract = {Red wood ants are ecologically important members of woodland communities, and some species are of conservation concern. They occur commonly only in certain habitats in Britain, but there is limited knowledge of their numbers and distribution. This study provided baseline information at a key locality (Abernethy Forest, 37 km(2)) in the central Highlands of Scotland and trialed a new method of surveying red wood ant density and stand type associations: a distance sampling line transect survey of nests. This method is efficient because it allows an observer to quickly survey a large area. either side of transect lines, without having to assume that all nests are detected. Instead, data collected on the distance of nests from the line are used to estimate probability of detection and the effective transect width, using the free software "Distance". Surveys took place in August and September 2003 along a total of 71.2 km of parallel, equally-spaced transects. One hundred and forty-four red wood ant nests were located, comprising 89 F. aquilonia (Yarrow, 1955) and 55 F. lugubris (Zetterstedt, 1838) nests. Estimated densities were 1.13 nests per hectare (95\% CI 0.74-1.73) for F. aquilonia and 0.83 nests per hectare (95\% CI 0.32-2.17) for F. lugubris. These translated to total estimated nest numbers of 4,200 (95\% CI 2,700-6,400) and 3,100 (95\% CI 1,200-8,100), respectively, for the whole forest. Indices of stand selection indicated that F. aquilonia had some positive association with old-growth and F. lugubris with younger stands (stem exclusion stage). No nests were found in areas that had been clear-felled, and ploughed and planted in the 1970s-1990s. The pattern of stand type association and hence distribution of F. aquilonia and F. lugubris may be due to the differing ability to disperse (F. lugubris is the faster disperser) and compete (F. aquilonia is competitively superior). We recommend using line transect sampling for extensive surveys of ants that construct nest mounds to estimate abundance and stand type association.},

  abstract = {Assessing and modelling abundance from animal count data is a very common task in ecology and management. Detection is arguably never perfect, but modern hierarchical models can incorporate detection probability and yield abundance estimates that are corrected for imperfect detection. Two variants of these models rely on counts of unmarked individuals, or territories (binomial N-mixture models, or binmix), and on detection histories based on territory-mapping data (multinomial N-mixture models or multimix). However, calibration studies which evaluate these two N-mixture model approaches are needed. We analysed conventional territory-mapping data (three surveys in 2014 and four in 2015) using both binmix and multimix models to estimate abundance for two common avian cavity-nesting forest species (Great Tit Parus major and Eurasian Blue Tit Cyanistes caeruleus). In the same study area, we used two benchmarks: occupancy data from a dense nestbox scheme and total number of detected territories. To investigate variance in estimates due to the territory assignment, three independent ornithologists conducted territory assignments. Nestbox occupancy yields a minimum number of territories, as some natural cavities may have been used, and binmix model estimates were generally higher than this benchmark. Estimates using the multimix model were slightly more precise than binmix model estimates. Depending on the person assigning the territories, the multimix model estimates became quite different, either overestimating or underestimating the `truth'. We conclude that N-mixture models estimated abundance reliably, even for our very small sample sizes. Territory-mapping counts depended on territory assignment and this carried over to estimates under the multimix model. This limitation has to be taken into account when abundance estimates are compared between sites or years. Whenever possible, accounting for such hidden heterogeneity in the raw data of bird surveys, via including a `territory editor' factor, is recommended. Distributing the surveys randomly (in time and space) to editors may also alleviate this problem.},

  abstract = {[Aim: I detail several problems and solutions related to estimating pre-settlement forest density from land surveyors' bearing tree data. The data have a high value, so clarification of existing problems is needed in the development of a better theoretical framework in which to treat them. I focus on absolute density because it is the foundation for several other variables, e.g. basal area, timber volume and carbon content. Location: The issues raised are relevant to the vast area encompassed by rectangular land surveys, including the General Land Office survey area of the United States (roughly, Ohio and Florida to the Pacific coast and Alaska), as well as significant areas in the eastern United States, and possibly elsewhere. Methods: A literature review details the history and nature of density estimation from bearing tree data, and spatial simulations quantify the effects of certain identified problems on density estimates. The review focuses on methodological issues appearing in the ecological and biometrical literature. Results: Problems encountered in the literature and addressed here include: (1) aggregated tree spatial patterns and their effect on density using traditional estimators; (2) the mis-designation of bearing tree labels in relation to definitions given in the estimators; (3) biases due to small sample size; and (4) surveyor-induced biases. Simulations of aggregated tree populations having a 44-fold density variation show that estimates ranging from 5 to 127 per cent of actual can result, depending on the estimator used, the scale at which it is calculated, and the error in tree distance rank assignments. The traditionally used estimator is accurate only when trees are spatially random throughout, and sample size is not small. More robust estimators exist that can accommodate a wider range of variation in spatial pattern, sampling design and sample size. One of these is discussed in detail. Main conclusions: Data users should pay much closer attention to critical aspects of bearing tree data and analytical methods, provide basic but necessary descriptive data, and more accurately represent the inherent range of possible errors of estimate. They can narrow this range of uncertainty by using the methods and considerations discussed here and in other recent work.]},

We develop estimators that allow correlated quadrat abundance estimates, even for quadrats in different sampling strata. Correlated quadrat abundance estimates based on mark-recapture or distance sampling methods occur when data are pooled across quadrats to estimate, for example, capture probability parameters or sighting functions. When only minimal information is available from each quadrat, pooling of data across quadrats may be necessary to efficiently estimate capture probabilities or sighting functions. We further include information from a quadrat-based auxiliary variable to more precisely estimate total population size via a ratio estimator. We also provide variance estimators for the difference between or the ratio of 2 abundance estimates, taken at different times. We present an example based on estimating the number of Mexican spotted owls (Strix occidentalis lucida) in the Upper Gila Mountains Recovery Unit, Arizona and, New Mexico, USA. Owl abundance for each quadrat was estimated with a Huggins 4-pass mark-resight population estimator, but with initial capture and resighting probabilities modeled in common across all sample quadrats. Pooling mark-resight data across quadrats was necessary because few owls were marked on individual quadrats to estimate quadrat-specific capture probabilities. Model-based estimates of owl abundance for each quadrat necessitated variance estimation procedures that take into account correlated quadrat estimates. An auxiliary variable relating to topographic roughness of sampled quadrats provided a useful covariate for a ratio estimator.},

However, this is often challenging for cetaceans as surveys typically cover only a portion of a population’s range and conventional stock assessment methods cannot then distinguish whether apparent changes in abundance reflect real changes in population size or shifts in distribution. We developed and tested methods for estimating population size and trend and detecting changes in population trend in the context of shifting habitat by integrating additional data into distance-sampling analysis. Previous research has shown that incorporating habitat information can improve population size estimates for highly mobile species with dynamic spatial distributions. Here, using simulated datasets representative of a large whale population, we demonstrate that incorporating individual mark-recapture data can increase the accuracy and precision of trend estimation and the power to distinguish whether apparent changes in abundance reflect changes in population trend or distribution shifts. We recommend that similar simulation studies are conducted for specific cetacean populations to assess the potential for detecting changes in population dynamics given available data. This approach is especially important wherever population change may be confounded with long-term change in distribution patterns associated with regime shifts or climate change.},

  abstract = {1. Unmanned aerial systems (UAS) are emerging as an accessible and versatile tool for ecologists, promising to revolutionize the way abundance and distribution data are obtained in wildlife studies. Establishment of UAS as an efficient and reliable tool demands understanding how detection errors influence UAS-derived counts and possible solutions to address them. 2. We describe two types of false-negative errors (availability and perception errors) and two types of false-positive errors (misidentification and double count) that may bias abundance estimates from UAS surveys. Then, we discuss available methods to address detection errors in UAS surveys and point out challenges for future developments. We present hierarchical models as an integrative framework to account for multiple detection errors and datasets in UAS abundance modelling. 3. Methods to address detection errors in UAS surveys depend on how data are collected (flight plan, images processing, and reviewing procedure). Conventional aerial surveys literature offers a set of solutions, especially to deal with false-negative errors. Available auxiliary information (such as ground counts and telemetry data) facilitates estimating detection errors, although the versatility of UAS permits exploring novel approaches. Solutions involve planning separated strip transects, temporally replicating flights, carrying out counts in orthomosaics, and multiple observer protocol. When automatic image review is used, subsample manual reviewing, trial experiments, and semiautomated procedures might deal with algorithm errors. 4. UAS surveys need to be consciously planned, thinking on what kind of errors can significantly affect counts and the use of raw counts and indices should be avoided. Approaches that formally account for false positives are needed, particularly for double counts. Hierarchical modelling (especially N-mixture models) offers a fruitful framework to explore and combine solutions, integrating multiple datasets and accommodating different detection errors.},

Unfortunately, there exist few general guidelines to help practitioners design monitoring programs that reach this balance. Here, we analyse a 33-year monitoring program from Ghana, West Africa, to provide both specific and general suggestions for monitoring in developing countries. Since the late 1960s the Ghana Wildlife Division has monitored more than 40 wildlife species with monthly surveys at sites throughout Ghana's nature reserves. These data present unparalleled opportunities to illuminate the scale and pattern of changes in animal abundance over time and the forces that drive these changes. We used sub-sampling of the Ghana monitoring data for four species in two savanna reserves to identify the minimum level of monitoring necessary to reliably detect changes in wildlife populations over 5-year intervals. We used a similar approach to estimate the minimum sampling needed to infer changes in abundance of hunters in reserves. Our results highlight the relative importance of comprehensive spatial and temporal sampling and suggest a requirement of no less than one monitoring site per every 285 km(2) in large reserves and 65 km(2) in smaller reserves. We discuss briefly the cost of effective monitoring and the relevance of our results to other regions of Africa and the world.},

There were more distinct differences in communities among wetland types than ecoregions, shrub swamps and peatlands had significantly more species and higher mean abundances than treed swamps, and Valley Ecoregion sites had the highest species richness and abundance. We also found strong wetland type and ecoregion affinities for particular species. Our results indicate that shrub swamps, particularly in the Valley Ecoregion, have high conservation value and are acting as important refugia for birds in this highly-fragmented landscape.

  abstract = {Nova Scotia's forested landscapes are degraded and under stress. As the province moves toward an ecological forestry management approach, land managers need more complete information about the relative biodiversity value of various habitats in landscapes that they manage to fully assess conservation consequences of different management options. To begin assessing the relative conservation value of different forest types, we surveyed bird communities in 18 forested wetlands (wooded bogs, tall shrub swamps, and treed swamps), mature upland forest stands, and regenerating upland forest stands in western Nova Scotia during the breeding season in 2017 and 2018. There were distinct differences among the bird communities in each forest type. Bird species diversity, overall abundance, and abundance of several guilds and species of conservation concern were higher in forested wetlands than in mature and regenerating upland forests. Bogs and shrub swamps had the highest number of species with strong habitat affinities, but treed swamps and mature sites had unique suites of strongly associated species and guilds - several of conservation concern. Regenerating sites were occupied mainly by forest-edge species and conservation value was low. Our study highlights the importance of forested wetlands to bird conservation and supports the idea that forested wetlands are avian diversity hotspots.},

  abstract = {1 Suction sampling is a popular method for the collection of quantitative data on grassland invertebrate populations, although there have been no detailed studies into the effectiveness of the method. 2 We investigate the effect of effort (duration and number of suction samples) and sward height on the efficiency of suction sampling of grassland beetle, true bug, planthopper and spider populations. We also compare suction sampling with an absolute sampling method based on the destructive removal of turfs. 3 Sampling for durations of 16 seconds was sufficient to collect 90\% of all individuals and species of grassland beetles, with less time required for the true bugs, spiders and planthoppers. The number of samples required to collect 90\% of the species was more variable, although in general 55 sub-samples was sufficient for all groups, except the true bugs. Increasing sward height had a negative effect on the capture efficiency of suction sampling. 4 The assemblage structure of beetles, planthoppers and spiders was independent of the sampling method (suction or absolute) used. 5 Synthesis and applications. In contrast to other sampling methods used in grassland habitats (e.g. sweep netting or pitfall trapping), suction sampling is an effective quantitative tool for the measurement of invertebrate diversity and assemblage structure providing sward height is included as a covariate. The effective sampling of beetles, true bugs, planthoppers and spiders altogether requires a minimum sampling effort of 110 sub-samples of duration of 16 seconds. Such sampling intensities can be adjusted depending on the taxa sampled, and we provide information to minimize sampling problems associated with this versatile technique. Suction sampling should remain an important component in the toolbox of experimental techniques used during both experimental and management sampling regimes within agroecosystems, grasslands or other low-lying vegetation types.},

As part of a long-term, multi-scale amphibian monitoring program, we evaluated the current status of the Yosemite Toad (Anaxyrus [Bufo] canorus) on national forest lands across the species' range in the Sierra Nevada, California, USA. We conducted monitoring at extensive (rangewide) and intensive (individual population) scales with small watersheds (2-4 km(2)), individual meadows, and breeding areas within meadows as sample units. Yosemite Toad breeding was found in an estimated proportion of 0.84 +/- 0.03 (SE) of recently occupied watersheds (locality data from 1990-2001), and 0.13 +/- 0.04 of historically occupied watersheds (locality data prior to 1990). Rangewide, breeding was found in an estimated proportion of 0.22 +/- 0.01 of watersheds. We quantified demographic parameters (abundance and survival of breeding males, abundance of egg masses, successful metamorphosis) in six meadows in two watersheds. Abundances were small, with the largest populations having only 16-21 and 18-19 breeding males each year. Annual survival rates of males by meadow ranged from 0.49-0.72. Numbers of egg masses per year were low, and the proportion of breeding areas with successful metamorphosis ranged from 0.14-0.73. Using the multi-scale data, we examined Yosemite Toad spatial and temporal occupancy patterns. Yosemite Toads tended to breed in one or two sites (lakes, meadows, stream reaches) per watershed every year, and occasionally in other sites. This assessment of the status of the Yosemite Toad will inform management decisions at both bioregional and population scales and the development of conservation priorities.},

To inform future conservation measures for this poorly known species, we used ecological niche factor analysis, habitat suitability modelling and distance sampling to determine landscape-scale habitat requirements and estimate the population size. Using GIS software, we integrated digital layers of ecogeographic variables with; (1) presence-only observations to derive and validate a habitat suitability model using ecological niche factor analysis, and (2) distance sampling to determine population distribution and densities across vegetation types. We detected populations in only five of seven reserves which they had occupied in 2000. We estimate the global population size to be 16,821 individuals (range 8431–39, 104), 68\% greater than the previously estimated 10,000 individuals, with a single large reserve containing the majority (∼92\%) of the global population. The Mallee Emu-wren is a habitat specialist, primarily occurring in mallee-Triodia vegetation that has not been burnt for at least 15 years. The highest densities were in vegetation associations containing at least a 15\% cover of Triodia, however, time since the habitat was last burnt was the overriding factor in determining densities. Large-scale wildfires are a pervasive threat to the global status of the Mallee Emu-wren, and the risk to remaining populations is exacerbated by the adverse impact of prolonged drought and the potential for altered fire regimes caused by global warming. Evaluation of the global population status, and the continued wildfire threat warranted recent reclassification of the Mallee Emu-wren from Vulnerable to Endangered according to IUCN Red List categories and criteria.},

We completed the aerial survey proposed in the U.S. Shorebird Conservation Plan to determine population size, winter distribution, and habitat associations. We conducted coastal aerial surveys from New Jersey to Texas during November 2002 to February 2003. This area comprised the entire wintering range of the eastern American oystercatcher within the United States. Surveys covered all suitable habitat in the United States for the Subspecies, partitioned into 3 survey strata: known roost sites, high-use habitat, and intercoastal tidal habitat. We determined known roost sites from extensive consultation with biologists and local experts in each state. High-use habitat included sand islands, sand spits at inlets, shell rakes, and oyster reefs. Partner organizations conducted ground counts in most states. We used high resolution still photography to determine detection rates for estimates of the number of birds in particular flocks, and we used ground counts to determine detection rates of flocks. Using a combination of ground and aerial counts, we estimated the population of eastern American oystercatchers to be 10,971 +/- 298. Aerial surveys can serve an important management function for shorebirds and possibly other coastal waterbirds by providing population status and trend information across a wide geographic scale.},

Both regulators and other major stakeholders are directly incorporated into the approach to enhance decision-making processes. We call this approach trade-off analysis. The approach uses a framework based on multi-criteria analysis (MCA) but involves stakeholders at all stages. This holistic approach is appropriate for multiple use, complex systems such as marine protected areas (MPAs), where many different users are apparently in conflict and where linkages and feedbacks between different aspects of the ecosystem and economy exist. The paper applies trade-off analysis to the case of Buccoo Reef Marine Park (BRMP) in Tobago. Stakeholder analysis is undertaken, and social, economic and ecological criteria identified. The impacts of four different development scenarios are evaluated for these criteria. Stakeholders are asked to weight different criteria and then the outcomes of different stakeholder weightings in the MCA are used to explore different management options. For BRMP, the MCA suggests consensus around development options characterised as limited tourism development for the area surrounding the park in association with the implementation of complementary environmental management. The approach has been used to enhance stakeholder involvement in decision-making and develop consensus-based approaches to management of the MPA. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. Ail rights reserved.},

This and other distance methods offer increased sampling efficiency over fixed-area plots (FA-P), but have long been known to produce biased density estimates when plant distribution deviates from random spatial patterns. Spatial indices have been developed to quantify the direction of this bias when plant distributions are aggregated or evenly distributed. Its continued use, especially in community analysis, requires additional scrutiny in measurements of community structure. We measured 14 forest stands of varying age, elevation and disturbance regime using FA-P and PCQ methods. Density estimates were biased, with the point-centered quarter method lower than fixed-area plot estimates when stems were aggregated and higher when stems were evenly spaced. In general the PCQ method underestimated species richness. The efficiency of the PCQ method makes it popular for ordination studies, although comparison of community structure varied from 18\% to 90\% similarity between the measurements of species basal area in the same stands using the two different methods. The bias observed in calculations of stem density, species abundance and community similarity indicate that use of the PCQ method should be approached with caution when used in community level analysis.},

  abstract = {Allens Pond, a coastal lagoon in southeastern Massachusetts, was subjected to two major hydrological events in the 2000s. The first was a culvert widening to increase tidal flushing in an attempt to stop the spread of the invasive plant, Phragmites australis. The second, four years later, was a complete inundation of the surrounding salt marsh due to the closure of a tidal inlet. The effect of these events on salt marsh vegetation was monitored using transects and on the marsh avian community using point counts. The inundation event, although limited to one growing season, had a more pronounced negative effect on marsh organisms than the restoration. Saltmarsh cordgrass, Spartina alterniflora, took approximately three years to recover to pre-inundation abundance. Salt marsh hay, Spartina patens, had still not recovered five years after the inundation. This supports the idea that this high marsh plant is particularly sensitive to prolonged inundation. There was no measurable effect of either the hydrological restoration or the inundation event on P. australis. Saltmarsh sparrows declined 79\% in the years immediately following the inundation, then recovered to their pre-inundation level in about eight years. Seaside sparrows declined 49\% immediately following the inundation event and recovered after eight years, although there was a great deal of variation. Willets were only affected in the year immediately after the inundation. Our results from this flooding incident at Allens Pond provide insight into the potential impact of rising sea levels on estuarine plant and avian communities.},

It addresses new methodologies, new technologies and recent developments in statistical theory and is the follow up companion to Introduction to Distance Sampling (OUP, 2001). In this text, a general theoretical basis is established for methods of estimating animal abundance from sightings surveys, and a wide range of approaches to analysis of sightings data is explored. These approaches include: modelling animal detectability as a function of covariates, where the effects of habitat, observer, weather, etc. on detectability can be assessed; estimating animal density as a function of location, allowing for example animal density to be related to habitat and other locational covariates; estimating change over time in populations, a necessary aspect of any monitoring programme; estimation when detection of animals on the line or at the point is uncertain, as often occurs for marine populations, or when the survey region has dense cover; survey design and automated design algorithms, allowing rapid generation of sound survey designs using geographic information systems; adaptive distance sampling methods, which concentrate survey effort in areas of high animal density; passive distance sampling methods, which extend the application of distance sampling to species that cannot be readily detected in sightings surveys, but can be trapped; and testing of methods by simulation, so that performance of the approach in varying circumstances can be assessed. Authored by a leading team this text is aimed at professionals in government and environment agencies, statisticians, biologists, wildlife managers, conservation biologists and ecologists, as well as graduate students, studying the density and abundance of biological populations.},

For example, large-scale offshore wind farms are proposed for UK waters, and surveys are currently being conducted to quantify numbers and distribution ahead of construction. 2. Technological advances mean that strip transect surveys may now be conducted, using digital methods. We address survey design and data analysis issues for such digital surveys, contrasting them with visual aerial line transect surveys. 3. We also explore the relative performances of the methods for estimating the size of a large aggregation of common scoters in Carmarthen Bay, Wales. We found that abundance estimates from two digital methods were closely comparable, while estimates from visual aerial surveys were appreciably lower. 4. Synthesis and applications. Efficient survey methods to quantify abundance and distribution of seabirds are needed, to assess change arising from climate change, or developments such as the construction of large-scale offshore wind farms. The traditional survey methods are visual surveys conducted along transects from ships or aircraft. Digital video and stills surveys can be conducted from aircraft flying sufficiently high to avoid disturbance, while still being able to detect and identify seabirds. Given the rapid technological developments, we expect digital surveys largely to replace visual surveys for seabirds in offshore regions.},

This self-contained book covers topics from the previous publications, while also including recent developments in method, software and application.Distance sampling refers to a suite of methods, including line and point transect sampling, in which animal density or abundance is estimated from a sample of distances to detected individuals. The book illustrates these methods through case studies; data sets and computer code are supplied to readers through the book’s accompanying website. Some of the case studies use the software Distance, while others use R code. The book is in three parts. The first part addresses basic methods, the design of surveys, distance sampling experiments, field methods and data issues. The second part develops a range of modelling approaches for distance sampling data. The third part describes variations in the basic method; discusses special issues that arise when sampling different taxa (songbirds, seabirds, cetaceans, primates, ungulates, butterflies, and plants); considers advances to deal with failures of the key assumptions; and provides a check-list for those conducting surveys.},

Unless complete Counts Oil Sample plots are feasible, this approach can easily lead to false conclusions, because detectability of birds varies by species, habitat, observer and many other factors. Trends in time of counts often reflect trends in detectability, rather than trends in abundance. Conclusions are further compromised when surveys are conducted at unrepresentative sites. We consider how to avoid these problems. We give a brief description of distance sampling methods, which allow detectability to be estimated. We consider strategies to ease their implementation, to enhance their reliability, to adapt the methods for difficult species, and to deal with circumstances in which representative sampling is problematic. We also consider some of the common problems encountered, and suggest solutions.},

  abstract = {This book introduces the suite of techniques known as 'distance sampling', so-called because the common theme is the sampling of distances of objects from a line or point. The objects are usually animals or groups of animals ('clusters'), and the primary aim is to estimate their density or abundance in a survey area. In line transect sampling, the sampled distances are the shortest or perpendicular distance from a detected object to the line. It is the most widely used method for assessing the abundance of a wide range of terrestrial and marine animals. In point transect sampling, distances of detected objects from the sampled points are recorded. This book provides a comprehensive introduction to both techniques, and also describes several related techniques.'Introduction to Distance Sampling' updates the 1993 book 'Distance Sampling', which was the first, and until now, only book devoted to the topic. The book is aimed at quantitative biologists and wildlife managers, and statisticians involved in wildlife monitoring programmes. Of particular significance in this update is the chapter on study design and field methods, which has been extensively rewritten and extended. New technologies such as laser range finders, theodolites and the Geographical Positioning System (GPS) are discussed, and advice is given on a wide range of survey methods. Analysis methods have also been generalized, through the use of various types of multiplier. Many exercises have been introduced, to make the book more useful to graduate students in wildlife and conservation management.},

Researchers commonly use animal-to-observer distances (AODs) in analysis, in preference to perpendicular distances from the line, which is in marked contrast with standard practice for other applications of line transect sampling. We formalize the mathematical shortcomings of approaches based on AODs, and show that they are likely to give strongly biased estimates of density. We review papers that claim good performance for the method, and explore this performance through simulations. These confirm strong bias in estimates of density using AODs. We conclude that AOD methods are conceptually flawed, and that they cannot in general provide valid estimates of density.},

We examine the implications of biodiversity assessments that fail to meet these criteria and suggest ways to alleviate these implications through analytical approaches.

We address some of the technical issues underlying composite indices, including survey design, weighting of the constituent indices, identification of change-points and estimation of spatially varying time trends. We suggest some criteria that biodiversity measures for use in monitoring surveys should satisfy, and we discuss the problems of implementing rigorous methods.

Monitoring programs provide the information to assess the state of conservation resources, the severity of threats and the success of management responses. Here we compare the management priorities, monitoring priorities and actual monitoring practices of protected area management agencies in Australia, using four sets of data at continental scale and five at a more restricted regional scale. We track changes over a period of several years and focus at successively finer levels of detail. At both continental and regional scales, most management plans emphasise fire, invasive species and visitor management; and most monitoring programmes refer to visitor numbers and impacts as well as species and ecosystems. There is only a weak match, however, between reported management priorities and actual monitoring programmes; and the effectiveness of management responses is rarely monitored. The level of detail in visitor monitor programmes varies considerably: most parks count visitors, but few know what those visitors do. Threats from fire and invasive species receive more attention that those from recreation. At regional scale, the proportion of parks with defined monitoring programmes and priorities increased significantly from 2003/2004 to 2006/2007. Whilst only a proportion of protected areas monitor endangered species populations, for those that do this is the parameter reported in most detail, with many parks reporting single records of single individuals. Some parks also maintain anecdotal records of rare species outside routine monitoring programs.},

Site analyses included 18 habitat variables, including total wetland area, area of open water, beaver or livestock evidence, edge type (abrupt or gradual), and percent cover of nine vegetation types. We analyzed avian species richness and abundance at the community level and in guilds based on migratory status and breeding habitat preference. Measures of vegetation and habitat-particularly those resulting from beaver activities-and gradual edges were significantly correlated with guild- and community-level variables. Evidence of beaver (i.e., forest gaps where trees had been felled, ponds where drainages had been dammed; hereafter referred to simply as “beaver evidence”) was significantly correlated with greater community-level species richness and abundance. Both beaver evidence and gradual edge were positively associated with greater species richness and abundance of Neotropical migratory birds (NTMBs) overall, as well as with the late-successional NTMB guild. Presence of gradual edge alone also was significantly correlated with high abundance of birds in the early-successional NTMB guild. Beaver and gradual edge may have contributed to higher-quality breeding habitats with relatively greater overall productivity and structural complexity in some wetlands.},

Baseline data collected during 1989-1995 are compared with data from a synthesis of recently published papers and reports and new field work carried out across the region during 2010-2014. We show that biodiversity endemism values are largely unchanged, although two new species (amphibian and mammal) have been named and two extremely rare tree species have been relocated. However, forest habitat continues to be lost and degraded, largely as a result of agricultural expansion, charcoal production to supply cities with cooking fuel, logging for timber and cutting of wood for firewood and building poles. Habitat loss is linked to an increase in the number of species threatened over time. The government-managed forest reserve network has expanded slightly but has low effectiveness. Three forest reserves have been upgraded to National Parks and Nature Reserves, which have stricter protection and more effective enforcement. There has also been rapid development of village-owned forest reserves, with more than 14o now existing; although usually small, they are an important addition to the areas being managed for sustainable resource use, and also provide tangible benefits to local people. Human-use pressures remain intense in many areas, and combined with emerging pressures from mining, gas and oil exploration, many endemic species remain threatened with extinction.},

We tested factors affecting nest survival, parasitism by the Brown-headed Cowbird (Molothrus ater), and species abundance in shrubland habitat in rural and urban landscapes. We found no support for our hypothesis that nest survival was lower in urban landscapes, but strong support for the hypothesis that survival increased with nest height. We found strong support for our hypothesis that cowbird parasitism was greater in urban than rural landscapes; parasitism in urban sites was at least twice that of rural sites. We found strong support for an urban landscape effect on abundance for several species; Northern Cardinal (Cardinalis cardinalis) and Brown-headed Cowbirds were more abundant in urban landscapes, whereas Field Sparrow (Spizella pusilla) and Blue-winged Warbler (Vermivora pinus) were more abundant in rural sites. There was support for lower abundances of Blue-gray Gnatcatcher (Polioptila caerulea) and Indigo Bunting (Passerina cyanea) with increased housing density. For six other species, edge and trail density or vegetation parameters best explained abundance. Lower abundances and greater parasitism in habitat patches in urban landscapes are evidence that, for some species, these urban landscapes do not fulfill the same role as comparable habitats in rural landscapes. Regional bird conservation planning and local habitat management in urban landscapes may need to consider these effects in efforts to sustain bird populations at regional and local scales.},

  abstract = {Aim As populations decline they become harder to detect simply because there are fewer animals to observe. In such cases, survey effort that was once reliable may become inadequate and the species incorrectly labelled locally extinct, causing management efforts to cease. For declining populations, then, we need to determine the survey effort necessary to detect the species, assuming only a single individual is present at a site. Detectability, however, often varies wildly with seasonal, behavioural and environmental variables. Thus, we need statistical analyses and survey design which can deal with highly variable detection rates and allow us to detect even very small populations. This is especially true in Australia, where many mammal species are experiencing serious decline. Here, we examine a threatened Australian rodent, the New Holland Mouse (Pseudomys novaehollandiae): we determine minimum survey requirements for reliable detection and show that historical survey effort is inadequate to assert local extinction. Location Victoria, Australia. Methods Using a 48-year live-trapping dataset, we estimated P. novaehollandiae abundance and detectability using N-mixture modelling in a Bayesian framework, testing the effects of seasonal fluctuations and environmental variables to determine ideal conditions for occupancy surveys. We used these findings to assess the adequacy of historical resurvey efforts in confirming local extinctions. Results We found that detectability followed seasonal fluctuations distinct from changes in abundance, was strongly reduced by brighter moon phases, and slightly increased over the course of a survey and when raining. When abundance was low, standard historical survey efforts were inadequate to assert the species' absence with appropriate statistical confidence, indicating that further surveys would be required to test purported local extinctions. Main conclusions Our results highlight the potential for considerable intra-species heterogeneity in detectability caused by shifting local abundances and survey conditions, as well as the importance of accounting for detectability when monitoring threatened and declining species.},

However, it would require nearly doubling to achieve, costefficiently, coverage targets for all countries, ecoregions, important sites, and species. Poorer countries have the largest relative shortfalls. Such extensive and rapid expansion of formal PAs is unlikely to be achievable. Greater focus is therefore needed on alternative approaches, including community- and privately managed sites and other effective area-based conservation measures.},

  abstract = {Many farmland bird populations are declining, and their negative trends are often associated with changes in land-use or farming practices, including the use of agrochemicals. The red-legged partridge (RLP) is a Mediterranean farmland game species of high socio-economic importance whose populations are thought to have declined sharply since the mid-20th century associated with farmland changes. However, no large-scale studies have tested whether abundance or trends of RLP are related to farmland composition or management. We used hierarchical distance sampling models to estimate RLP abundance in 2010 in central Spain (Castilla-La Mancha), a main European population stronghold of this species. We studied associations between RLP density and land-uses (including variation in management: irrigated crops or organic farming). We also assessed regional abundance variation over seven years (2010-2017) and its relationship with changes in land-use. Our results show that RLP abundance increased with the availability of natural vegetation and traditional rain-fed vineyards, but decreased with increasing proportions of tree crops and irrigated vineyards; the latter association was less pronounced in areas sensitive to nitrate contamination in water, where the amount of fertilizers applied in farmland and use of certain farming practices is more strictly regulated. These results support the idea that increases in intensive vineyards are detrimental to the RLP. We also report a strong population decline of RLP in the region, with a 51\% abundance reduction in seven years. This decline was steeper in areas where more natural vegetation had been lost and where ecological tree crops had increased. Overall, our results indicate that changes in land-use (type of crop, or the destruction of natural vegetation in farmland) and farming practices (e.g. use of irrigation in certain crops, use of nitrates) have important impacts on this farmland bird, affecting both spatial distribution and population dynamics.

  abstract = {In intertidal zones, tidal cycles reduce water depths and provide areas of shallow water where wading birds can forage for aquatic prey (water depths 0-50 cm). However, a bird that forages diurnally can make use of only a portion of the tidal cycle, which can limit fulfillment of energetic demands. Furthermore, daily and biweekly (spring-neap) tides may compound effects on shallow-water availability for foraging birds. However, the relative effects of daily and biweekly tidal periodicities on the foraging ecology of wading birds are seldom investigated due to a lack of appropriate tools. Therefore, we developed a tidal simulation model to provide dynamic spatiotemporal estimates of the availability of water depths that are within the upper and lower bounds of the birds' foraging water depth limits(” shallow-water availability `'). We studied two wading bird species, the Little Blue Heron (Egretta caerulea), a daytime-only forager, and the Great White Heron (Ardea herodias occidentalis), which feeds both diurnally and nocturnally, to evaluate the relative effects of daily and biweekly tides on shallow-water availability and on patterns in abundance of foraging birds. Seasonal foraging surveys (n = 38; 2011-2013) were conducted by boat along a 14-km transect adjacent to extensive intertidal flats in the lower Florida Keys, USA. For both species combined, biweekly tides resulted in a 0.61- to 6.09-fold change in abundance, whereas daily tides resulted in a 1.03- to 5.81-fold change in abundance. Diurnal shallow-water availability was not consistently correlated in magnitude or direction with spring-neap tidal cycles because differences in tide height between consecutive low tides were larger than changes in tidal amplitude from spring-neap tide cycles. Thus, the strong response by birds to the spring-neap tide was likely driven by mechanisms other than diurnal shallow-water availability alone.},

  abstract = {Understanding the age structure of vegetation is important for effective land management, especially in fire-prone landscapes where the effects of fire can persist for decades and centuries. In many parts of the world, such information is limited due to an inability to map disturbance histories before the availability of satellite images (\textasciitilde 1972). Here, we describe a method for creating a spatial model of the age structure of canopy species that established pre-1972. We built predictive neural network models based on remotely sensed data and ecological field survey data. These models determined the relationship between sites of known fire age and remotely sensed data. The predictive model was applied across a 104,000 km2 study region in semi-arid Australia to create a spatial model of vegetation age structure, which is primarily the result of stand-replacing fires which occurred before 1972. An assessment of the predictive capacity of the model using independent validation data showed a significant correlation (rs = 0.64) between predicted and known age at test sites. Application of the model provides valuable insights into the distribution of vegetation ageclasses and fire history in the study region. This is a relatively straightforward method which uses widely available data sources that can be applied in other regions to predict age-class distribution beyond the limits imposed by satellite imagery.},

  abstract = {We used a probabilistic approach to address the influence of sampling artifacts on the form of species-area relationships (SARs). We developed a model in which the increase in observed species richness is a function of sampling effort exclusively. We assumed that effort depends on area sampled, and we generated species-area curves under that model. These curves can be realistic looking. We then generated SARs from avian data, comparing SARs based on counts with those based on richness estimates. We used an approach to estimation of species richness that accounts for species detection probability and, hence, for variation in sampling effort, The slopes of SARs based on counts are steeper than those of curves based on estimates of richness, indicating that the former partly reflect failure to account for species detection probability. SARs based on estimates reflect ecological processes exclusively, not sampling processes. This approach permits investigation of ecologically relevant hypotheses. The slope of SARs is not influenced by the slope of the relationship between habitat diversity and area. In situations in which not all of the species are detected during sampling sessions, approaches to estimation of species richness integrating species detection probability should be used to investigate the rate of increase in species richness with area.},

Sampling methods were designed to resemble those used in similar surveys of 1-km2 sites in tropical rainforests in Cameroon and Sabah. A total of 27 species were recorded for the site. Slugs and a semi-slug were found only in the 2002 survey. Individual plots were very similar in species richness and composition; the richest plot contained about 85\% of the fauna recorded for the whole site. Overall densities were very high. This local homogeneity contrasts with marked heterogeneity over Crete as a whole. These results are contrasted with those from tropical forests, where individual plots vary considerably in richness and composition, where densities are lower and where the total site faunas are larger. Although there are problems associated with differing amounts of sampling error between studies, this contrast is striking and some possible causes are discussed. Further work in tropical forest on limestone may elucidate this.},

  abstract = {We used stereo recordings of point counts from Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) routes to estimate inter-observer variability, to compare recordings with field observers, and to evaluate multiple-observer occupancy-model approaches to adjust for incomplete detection. We asked six birders with point-count experience (listeners) to listen to recordings of 80 stops from four BBS routes and report all the species they detected at each stop. Listeners went through each recording only once, without the use of aids such as spectrograms, to simulate field conditions. Listeners differed significantly in the mean number of species reported, ranging from 7.8 to 10.6 species per stop, compared with 12.6 confirmed on the recordings. On average, 14\% of the reported records were identification errors (i.e., species not present on the recording), and 23\% of species present on the recordings were overlooked. Field observers reported similar numbers of species as some listeners, but fewer species than were on the recordings. Multiple-observer occupancy models failed to correctly account for identification errors and tended to overestimate species richness by 1.0-8.4 species per stop; species-specific occupancy estimates were positively biased by 69-100\%. Although inter-observer variability clearly needs to be considered in analysis of point-count data, multiple-observer occupancy models do not adequately correct for this variation. The number of species detected on recordings suggests that they have considerable potential to supplement current monitoring programs, but further development of analysis methods is required to address observer effects.

  abstract = {Estimating the abundance and breeding success of territorial songbirds is challenging. Various types of surveys and analyses are available, but all receive some criticism in the literature, and most methods are rarely compared with results obtained using intensive monitoring efforts. We assessed the efficacy of transect and point-count surveys to estimate the abundance of male Bobolinks (Dolichonyx oryzivorus) and detect evidence of nesting and fledging by comparing the results of those surveys to results from more intensive monitoring (i.e., spot mapping and nest monitoring). We monitored 36 fields (254 ha) of late-harvest hay, restored grassland, and fallow fields in the Luther Marsh Wildlife Management Area and on four farms in southern Ontario, Canada, in 2018. Compared to the number of territories identified based on spot mapping (197), distance sampling analysis of transect survey data provided a more accurate estimate of the abundance of male Bobolinks (230, 95\% CI: 187, 282) thanN-mixture models of transect (668, 95\% CI: 332, 1342) and point-count (337, 95\% CI: 203, 559) data. Three visits to survey transects and five to point counts did not effectively detect evidence of Bobolink breeding (i.e., nesting or fledging) in fields compared to spot mapping and nest monitoring. Distance sampling analysis of transect data appears promising for estimating the number of Bobolink territories in an area, e.g., those impacted by conservation programs. If estimates of the number of nesting Bobolinks and frequency of fledging are of interest, spot mapping and nest monitoring could be implemented at a subset of sampled fields. Our results suggest that additional studies to evaluate model-based estimates of abundance with the best available information (e.g., from spot mapping of marked or unmarked populations and nest monitoring) would be useful to ensure that robust estimates are provided to support population estimates and conservation actions.},

  abstract = {Recent studies highlight the importance of selecting the appropriate scale and indices of invasion level for evaluating the abundance and impact of alien plants. Our survey considers the use of vegetation plot databases compared with floristic checklists to address invasion patterns regarding alien – native relationships across vegetation types by means of a multi-scale approach. We analysed the alien– native richness relationship in 1077 vegetation plots from the Basque Country (N. Spain) at ecosystem level and phytosociological class and alliance levels. According to our results, the alien species richness (Alo) –native species richness (Nat) relationship is variable and depends not only on the scale but also on the vegetation type. In contrast with other multi-scale approaches, no negative correlation has been detected at any studied level. The strong correlation existing between plot number and cumulative Alo and cumulative Nat highlights the constraints of using checklists to generalize invasion patterns. Our results demonstrate that the combined use of both relative alien species richness and relative alien species cover facilitates the understanding of invasion patterns across plant communities at different scales. In addition to climate, disturbance and propagule pressure, habitat type proved to be an important filter for alien species, capable of explaining such patterns.},

  abstract = {The rainfall regime of the Pampas region of Argentina shows a long-term cyclic behavior that has increased in intensity over the historical mean during the last four decades. In this paper we explored the effects of changes in monthly cumulative rainfall on lagoon and riparian habitat, and, in turn on the wetland waterbird community. We also explored the responses of waterbird morphofunctional groups to fluctuation in water level and habitat diversity caused by the change in rainfall at the Mar Chiquita Coastal Lagoon, Argentina (37 degrees 32' to,37 degrees 45'S, 57 degrees 19' to 57 degrees 26'W). Analysis of satellite images shows that increases in rainfall increased wetland water surface, but reduced riparian habitat area and habitat diversity. Increases in water surface negatively affected the abundances and species richness of waterbirds; habitat diversity did not explain a significant portion of total waterbird variability. Shorebirds (i.e., yellowlegs, plover, sandpiper) were the most affected by reduction in mudflats and habitat diversity. Other waterbirds (i.e., long-legged wading birds, waterfowls) were affected by increases in water surface (ducks, swans, long-legged waterbirds and gulls), decrease in mudflat availability (long-legged waterbirds and gulls), and decrease in habitat diversity (ducks). Our results show that the inter-annual variability in the rainfall pattern influenced the presence and abundance of most waterbirds, and species richness and composition. Fluctuation in water depth per se is known to be a key factor for habitat use of many waterbirds, but habitat diversity also needs to be considered.},

Value of information (VoI) analysis can be used to quantify how additional information may improve management outcomes: despite its potential, this method is still underused in environmental decision-making. We provide a primer on how to calculate the VoI and assess whether reducing uncertainty will change a decision. Our aim is to facilitate the application of VoI by managers who are not familiar with decision-analytic principles and notation, by increasing the technical accessibility of the tool. Calculating the VoI requires explicit formulation of management objectives and actions. Uncertainty must be clearly structured and its effects on management outcomes evaluated. We present two measures of the VoI. The expected value of perfect information is a calculation of the expected improvement in management outcomes that would result from access to perfect knowledge. The expected value of sample information calculates the improvement in outcomes expected by collecting a given sample of new data. We guide readers through the calculation of VoI using two case studies: (i) testing for disease when managing a frog species and (ii) learning about demographic rates for the reintroduction of an endangered turtle. We illustrate the use of Bayesian updating to incorporate new information. The VoI depends on our current knowledge, the quality of the information collected and the expected outcomes of the available management actions. Collecting information can require significant investments of resources; VoI analysis assists managers in deciding whether these investments are justified.},

However, information extraction by per pixel multispectral classification techniques proves to be very complex owing to the internal variability increase in land-cover units and to the weakness of spectral resolution. Image segmentation before classification was proposed as an alternative approach, but a large variety of segmentation algorithms were developed during the last 20 years, and a comparison of their implementation on very high spatial resolution images is necessary. In this study, four algorithms from the two main groups of segmentation algorithms (boundarybased and region-based) were evaluated and compared. In order to compare the algorithms, an evaluation of each algorithm was carried out with empirical discrepancy evaluation methods. This evaluation is carried out with a visual segmentation of Ikonos panchromatic images. The results show that the choice of parameters is very important and has a great influence on the segmentation results. The selected boundary-based algorithms are sensitive to the noise or texture. Better results are obtained with regionbased algorithms, but a problem with the transition zones between the contrasted objects can be present.},

To try to reduce the time, effort, and financial costs of monitoring large mammals, I examine a 20-year dataset of herbivore records taken from vehicle transects carried out in Katavi National Park, western Tanzania. I find that: (i) population trends obtained from ground transects are similar to those obtained from aerial surveys conducted over a wider area; (ii) the frequency of vehicle surveys driven per year or (iii) across years can be reduced without losing substantial information; (iv) it is inadvisable to stint on numbers of transects driven; and (v) trends in populations of single species do not represent those of others. These findings are encouraging because they indicate that managers can obtain relatively accurate information about herbivore population trends through infrequent and therefore more cost-effective monitoring.},

  abstract = {Knowledge about how hunting pressure is determined, and the relative efficacy of different mechanisms to regulate harvest, can help to improve the managers' decision-making process. We developed a general framework about the decision-making process that regulates redlegged partridge (Alectoris rufa) hunting pressure in central Spain based on information from a focus group and individual interviews with game managers. We also used available information to compare the efficiency of different tools thus improving some decision steps. We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of different population monitoring methods as a way to reduce uncertainty on partridge availability to hunters. Additionally, we investigated the relationship between annual harvest and various regulatory mechanisms of partridge hunting pressure used in the study area to identify the most potentially useful one to limit annual take-off. Game managers usually set hunting pressure after a qualitative assessment on population abundance prior to the hunting season, but this decision was frequently modified during the course of the hunting season according to variations in catch or perceived abundance at that time. Our results showed that kilometric abundance indices (counting partridges from cars along line transects) was a simple cost-efficient and reliable estimate of partridge density (estimated by Distance sampling). A variety of regulatory mechanisms were used by managers. The variables that most affected annual harvest (in addition to partridge abundance) were the number of driven-shooting days, and hunter density in walked-up hunting days, suggesting that their adjustment will be the most efficient regulatory mechanisms. We conclude that adequate monitoring on population abundance should be a critical step for managers' decision-making, and that a better understanding of the relative value of regulatory mechanisms, combining social and ecological approaches, would help improving our understanding of any human-mediated system, thus leading to better management recommendations.},

  abstract = {Understanding species distribution is central to ecology, evolution and wildlife conservation. However, detecting species presence in the field may be challenging, especially for scarce, elusive and wide-ranging animals such as mammalian carnivores. Here we undertook a large-scale methodological study to assess scat sampling effort required to detect five mesocarnivore species in a Spanish Mediterranean area. Our goals were to: (1) evaluate the optimal effort (i.e. transect length) needed to detect scats of each species; and (2) examine if this sampling effort depends on environmental factors. First, we constructed "curves of first detection" for each carnivore species and evaluated the most cost-effective sampling effort. Second, we used Generalized Linear Mixed Models (GLMMs) to relate the transect length to first detection of each species in each positive transect to a comprehensive set of environmental variables. Our results suggested that sampling effort in this study, namely the transect length needed to detect a given species, can be substantially shortened for two species (red fox and stone marten) with a relatively low reduction in the information on their presence. The most efficient scenario corresponded to a transect length of 1.5 km, where red foxes and stone martens would be detected in 72.95 and 65.43\% of the positive transects, respectively. However, different sampling approaches would be advisable for the remaining species. We also found that the sampling effort was weakly affected by environmental constraints. Our study may contribute to the design of more efficient scat-based carnivore sampling methodologies elsewhere. In particular, we propose that our results can be successfully extrapolated to other areas of the Iberian Peninsula with close abundances of the species considered and similar environmental characteristics.

  abstract = {Species conservation and management require reliable information about animal distribution and population size. Better management actions within a species' range can be achieved by identifying the location and timing of population changes. In the Greater Mahale Ecosystem (GME), western Tanzania, deforestation due to the expansion of human settlements and agriculture, annual burning, and logging are known threats to wildlife. For one of the most charismatic species, the endangered eastern chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii), approximately 75\% of the individuals are distributed outside national park boundaries, requiring monitoring and protection efforts over a vast landscape of various protection statuses. These efforts are especially challenging when we lack data on trends in density and population size. To predict spatio-temporal chimpanzee density and abundance across the GME, we used density surface modeling, fitting a generalized additive model to a 10-year time-series data set of nest counts based on line-transect surveys. The chimpanzee population declined at an annual rate of 2.41\%, including declines of 1.72\% in riparian forests (from this point forward, forests), 2.05\% in miombo woodlands (from this point forward, woodlands) and 3.45\% in nonforests. These population declines were accompanied by ecosystem-wide declines in vegetation types of 1.36\% and 0.32\% per year for forests and woodlands, respectively; we estimated an annual increase of 1.35\% for nonforests. Our model predicted the highest chimpanzee density in forests (0.86 chimpanzees/km2, 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) 0.60–1.23; as of 2020), followed by woodlands (0.19, 95\% CI 0.12–0.30) and nonforests (0.18, 95\% CI 0.10–1.33). Although forests represent only 6\% of the landscape, they support nearly one-quarter of the chimpanzee population (769 chimpanzees, 95\% CI 536–1103). Woodlands dominate the landscape (71\%) and therefore support more than a half of the chimpanzee population (2294; 95\% CI 1420–3707). The remaining quarter of the landscape is represented by nonforests and supports another quarter of the chimpanzee population (750; 95\% CI 408–1381). Given the pressures on the remaining suitable habitat in Tanzania, and the need of chimpanzees to access both forest and woodland vegetation to survive, we urge future management actions to increase resources and expand the efforts to protect critical forest and woodland habitat and promote strategies and policies that more effectively prevent irreversible losses. We suggest that regular monitoring programs implement a systematic random design to effectively inform and allocate conservation actions and facilitate interannual comparisons for trend monitoring, measuring conservation success, and guiding adaptive management.},

The reference population abundance in each habitat was calculated through an intensive capture, colour-banding, and resighting effort. Line transects consistently produced unbiased estimates of density for both sites at two time periods (morning and afternoon), and proved to be the most efficient of the distance sampling methods tested. Point-transect methods proved to be biased in this instance, consistently producing overestimates of density for this species, and were unreliable as indices of the small differences in density between habitats. Transect counts conducted from established walking tracks underestimated both density and the variance of estimated density. We conclude that in situations requiring estimates of absolute density for North Island saddleback, a series of randomly positioned line transects will accurately represent the density of individuals. Furthermore, this study highlights the need to pilot distance survey techniques on the species of interest to detect possible violation of the assumptions underlying these methods. We question the widespread use of point-transect counts for censusing avian species without such preliminary investigation, and recommend further comparisons of distance sampling methods in New Zealand with reference populations where opportunity provides.},

However, to obtain reliable patterns from counts, imperfect detection should always be considered, with particular reference to rare and elusive species. By analysing data from a citizen science monitoring program based on multiple simultaneous observers, we studied detection probability of the Sardinian mountain newt, Euproctus platycephalus. Detectability of individual newts widely varied among observers, and was positively affected by the number of newts exposed to during sampling. Training, although appearing to improve detectability, did not accommodate for differences among trained observers. No effect of sampling hour, tree shade, cloud cover, water flow, turbidity, and temperature was found, possibly due to standardisation of sampling conditions. Depending on observer's skills and the population exposed to during sampling, detection probability of newt populations can widely vary. Most of the sampling units (pools) had few newts exposed to during sampling, with a high probability of recording false absences. Herpetological surveys could be more extensively based on multiple simultaneous observers to reduce observer heterogeneity bias in the detection process, and obtain more reliable patterns of species abundance and distribution for conservation purposes.},

Aims: To evaluate the efficiency of a diving duck census in the breeding season based on an analysis of the resighting probability of individually marked female ducks. Methods: We used monitoring data from 2004 to 2015 of individually marked females of Common Pochard Aythya ferina, Tufted Duck Aythya fuligula and Red-crested Pochard Netta rufina in South Bohemia, Czech Republic. Using a model selection approach, the resighting probabilities of females were modelled incorporating covariate parameters, such as stage of breeding, census month, year, numbers of counted individuals, individual species, water surface area and proportion of emergent vegetation. Results: We demonstrated the significant effect of the stage of breeding, year and census month on the resighting probability of females, while the number of individuals, water surface area and proportion of emergent vegetation did not contribute to the best models. Moreover, the three investigated species with different local population sizes did not differ in resighting probabilities. The incubation period of the females (i.e. June) corresponded to the lowest detection probability in the study area. Conclusions: Our approach of using individually marked females contributed to modelling to show census accuracy for diving ducks was substantially enhanced by avoiding counting females during the incubation period. Ultimately, these findings are crucial to increase the accuracy of their breeding population size estimation.},

The use of acoustic recordings to survey birds offers solutions to these limitations. We designed a Soundscape Recording System (SRS) that combines a four-channel, discrete microphone system with a quadraphonic playback system for surveying bird communities. We compared the effectiveness of SRS and point counts for estimating species abundance, richness, and composition of riparian breeding birds in California by comparing data collected simultaneously using both methods. We used the temporal-removal method to estimate individual bird detection probabilities and species abundances using the program MARK. Akaike's Information Criterion provided strong evidence that detection probabilities differed between the two survey methods and among the 10 most common species. The probability of detecting birds was higher when listening to SRS recordings in the laboratory than during the field survey. Additionally, SRS data demonstrated a better fit to the temporal-removal model assumptions and yielded more reliable estimates of detection probability and abundance than point-count data. Our results demonstrate how the perceptual constraints of observers can affect temporal detection patterns during point counts and thus influence abundance estimates derived from time-of-detection approaches. We used a closed-population capture-recapture approach to calculate jackknife estimates of species richness and average species detection probabilities for SRS and point counts using the program CAPTURE. SRS and point counts had similar species richness and detection probabilities. However, the methods differed in the composition of species detected based on Jaccard's similarity index. Most individuals (83\%) detected during point counts vocalized at least once during the survey period and were available for detection using a purely acoustic technique, such as SRS. SRS provides an effective method for surveying bird communities, particularly when most species are detected by sound. SRS can eliminate or minimize observer biases, produce permanent records of surveys, and resolve problems associated with the limited availability of expert field observers.},

In our view, intensifying enforcement effort is crucial, but will ultimately prove an inadequate long-term strategy with which to conserve high-value species. This is because: regulatory approaches are being overwhelmed by the drivers of poaching and trade, financial incentives for poaching are increasing due to rising prices and growing relative poverty between areas of supply and centers of demand, and aggressive enforcement of trade controls, in particular bans, can increase profits and lead to the involvement of organized criminals with the capacity to operate even under increased enforcement effort. With prices for high-value wildlife rising, we argue that interventions need to go beyond regulation and that new and bold strategies are needed urgently. In the immediate future, we should incentivize and build capacity within local communities to conserve wildlife. In the medium term, we should drive prices down by reexamining sustainable off-take mechanisms such as regulated trade, ranching and wildlife farming, using economic levers such as taxation to fund conservation efforts, and in the long-term reduce demand through social marketing programs.},

Automated classification algorithms provide cost- and time-effective means to process information-rich data, but often at the cost of additional detection errors. Appropriate methods are necessary to analyse such data while dealing with the different types of detection errors. We developed a hierarchical modelling framework for estimating species occupancy from automated species detection data. We explore design and optimization of data post-processing procedures to account for detection errors and generate accurate estimates. Our proposed method accounts for both imperfect detection and false-positive errors and utilizes information about both occurrence and abundance of detections to improve estimation. Using simulations, we show that our method provides much more accurate estimates than models ignoring the abundance of detections. The same findings are reached when we apply the methods to two real datasets on North American frogs surveyed with acoustic recorders. When false positives occur, estimator accuracy can be improved when a subset of detections produced by the classification algorithm is post-validated by a human observer. We use simulations to investigate the relationship between accuracy and effort spent on post-validation, and found that very accurate occupancy estimates can be obtained with as little as 1\% of data being validated. Automated monitoring of wildlife provides opportunity and challenges. Our methods for analysing automated species detection data help to meet key challenges unique to these data and will prove useful for many wildlife monitoring programmes.},

Climate can affect avian abundance, and socioeconomics may affect the human propensity to contribute to conservation. Yet, little is known about how these two factors interact to affect species. We assessed the relative influence of within-scale (landscape) and cross-scale (region-landscape) interaction effects of breeding-season temperature and four socioeconomic variables (percent female, percent college educated, median age, and median income) on the relative abundance of eight forest bird species in the Eastern Temperate Forest Ecoregion of North America. We used negative binomial regression to model relative abundance over three years. Akaike's Information Criterion for small sample sizes (AICc) was used to rank a set of nine a priori models for each combination of species and socioeconomic variable. Of the 32 best-supported models, seven included informative within-scale interactions and three additional models included informative cross-scale interactions, indicating that the relationships between species' relative abundance and socioeconomic variables varied for different levels of temperature. Our results suggest that interactions were generally less influential than were climate, socioeconomic, and habitat variables. Distinct responses to interactions were not evident between habitat groups or between wintering groups. Interactions between human socioeconomic variables and breeding-season temperature at different spatial scales can affect forest bird abundance in species-specific ways. Ignoring the effects of interactions on broad-scale patterns of avian abundance may result in misleading interpretations about additive effects and, consequently, ineffective use of limited conservation resources.},

  abstract = {Asian elephants occurring in northern Borneo form a geographically isolated and genetically distinct population. Of this, the subpopulation of Central Sabah holds the greatest opportunity for long-term survival, due to a relatively large population size and occurrence over a vast, contiguous and protected habitat. We surveyed this subpopulation in 2015 using advanced methods to obtain a population size estimate. We used the distance-sampling framework and laid out transects following a stratified random design for counting elephant dung piles; measured dung decay following the ‘retrospective' method; and used Bayesian analysis to estimate dung decay rate and dung pile density. Thus, we estimated a posterior mean dung decay rate of 212 days (95\% BCI: 133–319), an overall elephant density of 0.07 per km2 (95\% BCI: 0.03–0.11) and a population size of 387 elephants (95\% BCI: 169–621). These estimates were far lower than the population size of 1132 individuals and density of 1.18 per km2 estimated in 2008. It is unlikely that there has been a steep population decline, as there were no drastic land-use changes between 2008 and 2015, nor were there other identifiable causes for a population decline. Therefore, it appears that the methodological and analytical flaws in the previous estimate are the most plausible reason for this observed difference. Given that the new estimate suggests a much smaller population, it is prudent and precautionary to use the new estimate as the basis for all policy decisions and conservation actions for elephants in Sabah.},

The likely impacts of climate change on the frequency and intensity of wildfire highlights the importance of understanding how fire-induced heterogeneity may affect different components of the biota. Here, we examine the influence of wildfire, as an agent of landscape heterogeneity, on the distribution of arboreal mammals in fire-prone forests in south-eastern Australia. First, we used a stratified design to examine the role of topography, and the relative influence of fire severity and fire history, on the occurrence of arboreal mammals 2-3 years after wildfire. Second, we investigated the influence of landscape context on the occurrence of arboreal mammals at severely burnt sites. Forested gullies supported a higher abundance of arboreal mammals than slopes. Fire severity was the strongest influence, with abundance lower at severely burnt than unburnt sites. The occurrence of mammals at severely burned sites was influenced by landscape context: abundance increased with increasing amount of unburnt and understorey-only burnt forest within a 1 km radius. These results support the hypothesis that unburnt forest and moist gullies can serve as refuges for fauna in the post-fire environment and assist recolonization of severely burned forest. They highlight the importance of spatial heterogeneity created by wildfire and the need to incorporate spatial aspects of fire regimes (e.g., creation and protection of refuges) for fire management in fire-prone landscapes.},

  abstract = {In recent decades, the establishment of plantations to produce biomass for energy, known as short rotation coppice (SRC), has been increasing in many countries in Europe. As with other tree plantations, these stands could enhance the structural diversity of intensively managed farmlands and consequently lead to an increase in animal diversity. In this study, we examined the effects of hybrid poplar SRCs on breeding bird richness, diversity and abundance in Northern Italy. We recorded bird species and estimated their abundances using point counts. We then analysed the relationships between landscape composition and bird abundances, as well as community composition, using canonical correspondence analysis. The results showed that birds abundances in SRCs were generally lower than in woodland and arable land (SRC: 1.30 birds/km(2), woodland: 2.57, arable land: 1.89), and the same was true for species richness (SRC: 7.06 species/km(2), woodland: 12.90, arable land: 9.13) and species diversity (Shannon Indices in SRC: 0.951, woodland: 1.606, arable land: 1.241). Half of the species found in SRC are considered farmland birds, a group whose species richness was significantly higher than that of forest and generalist species. Our research suggests that a system with rotational harvesting of mixed age and structure stands enhances habitat heterogeneity and consequently could support bird communities. In particular, SRCs and reforestations seem to play an important role for some birds by providing them with complementary or supplementary habitat for foraging and nesting.},

  abstract = {The Straw-headed Bulbul Pycnonotus zeylanicus is one of South-East Asia’s most threatened songbirds due to relentless demand for the regional cage-bird trade. The species was recently uplisted from ‘Endangered’ to ‘Critically Endangered’ only two years after its previous uplisting. Intriguingly, populations in highly urbanised Singapore appear relatively secure. However, the last Singaporean density estimates, derived from traditional census methods, were obtained nearly two decades ago in 2001. A recent population estimate in 2016 was derived from the census work in 2001 coupled with relative abundance indices from population trends. We thus performed systematic field surveys using the distance sampling method, estimating 573 Æ 185 individuals nationwide, with a break-down of 217 Æ 81 on the main island of Singapore and 356 Æ 104 birds on the satellite of Pulau Ubin. Taken together, the total population estimate reported here comprises 22.9–57.3\% of the global wild population, underscoring the importance of Singapore as a stronghold for the species. In spite of its apparently secure status in Singapore, the species remains susceptible to local and foreign trapping pressures. Based on our assessment, we propose a number of local and regional conservation measures to ensure the continued survival of populations in Singapore.},

  abstract = {Aerial surveys are a critical tool for inference of wildlife populations, yet are limited by current available methods to account for imperfect detection without marking animals. N-mixture models use count data from replicate surveys for estimation of wildlife abundance while accounting for imperfect detection. This statistical framework was recently developed but is rarely applied to aerial surveys of terrestrial wildlife. We applied an N-mixture model incorporating temporary emigration to a novel aerial survey design to estimate the availability, detection probability, and abundance of an unmarked population of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) in Michigan, USA, using surveys in 2014 and 2016. We assessed the selection of the sample unit size for the N-mixture model in a post hoc sensitivity analysis and compared all estimates to a hierarchical distance sampling (HDS) approach. Hierarchical distance sampling is an expansion of conventional distance sampling (CDS), a standard method applied to aerial survey designs for wildlife, where HDS allows for modeling spatial variation in abundance and detection probability using environmental covariates and can account for changing population demographics. We found N-mixture models produced similar parameter estimates to HDS with both models inferring a population increase between years, which was consistent with independently available estimates for this population (2014 N-mixture = 402 [CI: 303.8–515.27], and HDS = 391 [CI: 297.67–504.63]; 2016 N-mixture = 732 [CI: 572.89–924.22], and HDS = 708 [CI: 552.45–893.89]). Estimates from both models were sensitive to the sample unit size selected in an open population framework. We recommend using ecological (e.g., home range size) and statistical (e.g., sample size) considerations when selecting a sample unit size that reflects the movement ecology of a species and evaluating the sensitivity of parameters to sample unit size. In our study, N-mixture models and HDS models afforded a practical field approach and analytical methodology that resulted in precise estimation in a population of unmarked deer over time. When used with aerial surveys in terrestrial systems where distance sampling methods may be difficult to implement, N-mixture models can address observer error and estimate populations for conservation and management goals without marking individual animals.},

Shrub expansion is likely to increase winter habitat availability for ptarmigan, which in turn influence shrub architecture and growth through browsing. Despite their ecological role in the Arctic, the distribution and movement patterns of ptarmigan are not well known, particularly in northern Alaska where shrub expansion is occurring. We used multi-season occupancy models to test whether ptarmigan occupancy varied within and among years, and the degree to which colonization and extinction probabilities were related to shrub cover and latitude. Aerial surveys were conducted from March to May in 2011 and April to May 2012 in a 21,230 km(2) area in northeastern Alaska. In areas with at least 30 \% shrub cover, the probability of colonization by ptarmigan was ¿ 0.90, indicating that moderate to extensive patches of shrubs (typically associated with riparian areas) had a high probability of becoming occupied by ptarmigan. Occupancy increased throughout the spring in both years, providing evidence that ptarmigan migrated from southern wintering areas to breeding areas north of the Brooks Range. Occupancy was higher in the moderate snow year than the high snow year, and this was likely due to higher shrub cover in the moderate snow year. Ptarmigan distribution and migration in the Arctic are linked to expanding shrub communities on a wide geographic scale, and these relationships may be shaping ptarmigan population dynamics, as well as rates and patterns of shrub expansion.},

  abstract = {Twenty-one stream reaches in northwestern Vermont were surveyed to assess the relative influence of local- and watershed-scale variables on stream biotic assemblages including fish, aquatic macroinvertebrates and birds. Data were collected during the summers of 2003 and 2004 and included quantitative and qualitative geomorphic and habitat assessments (local-scale) and land-use characterization and modelled annual flow and sediment loading (watershed-scale). Biotic assemblages were surveyed to capture characteristics related to abundance, diversity and composition. Principal components analysis (PCA) was used to generate sets of factors representing unique scenarios of geophysical data derived from various spatial extents within the watershed. These factors were then used as the independent variables in multiple regression models using the biotic data as the dependent variables. Forty significant models were built from the combination of the eight scenarios and 11 dependent variables. Fish assemblage diversity and composition were influenced by a combination of local-scale and watershed-scale variables; however, the qualitative local data were more predictive than the quantitative data. Local-scale data and sediment (model-derived) were important factors in building significant macroinvertebrate models. Bird abundance and species richness were best predicted using local geomorphic characteristics and the qualitative local data. Our results reinforce the concept that whereas both local- and watershed-scale variables affect stream biota, their relative influence depends upon the individual ecology of each taxon. In order to address these issues, comprehensive watershed management, restoration and conservation plans would benefit from assessments at multiple scales and from geomorphological, watershed and multitaxonomic perspectives.

  abstract = {The commercial harvesting of kangaroos requires the regular monitoring of populations using a technique that is precise and reasonably accurate. Because of the broad distribution of the species and the generally large management areas, wildlife authorities rely on some form of aerial survey to estimate both relative and absolute kangaroo densities. Methodology for fixed-wing aircrafl was developed in the 1970s and has generally become standardized in areas where it is applied. The technique allows for broad-scale coverage of management areas and involves flying at a set height, speed and direction and counting in fixed (generally 200 m) strips. An alternative method using a differentsurvey platform (helicopter),sampling procedure (monitor block) and survey technique (line transect) has been developed recently. The technique has advantages over the standard fixed-wing survey method in accuracy, Species applicability and repeatability with disadvantages in cost, time taken and in coverage of Overall Spatial variation. Other issues related to the benefits and drawbacks of the two methods are discussed.},

  abstract = {It is common to use multiple field sampling methods when implementing wildlife surveys to compare method efficacy or cost efficiency, integrate distinct pieces of information provided by separate methods, or evaluate method-specific biases and misclassification error. Existing models that combine information from multiple field methods or sampling devices permit rigorous comparison of method-specific detection parameters, enable estimation of additional parameters such as false-positive detection probability, and improve occurrence or abundance estimates, but with the assumption that the separate sampling methods produce detections independently of one another. This assumption is tenuous if methods are paired or deployed in close proximity simultaneously, a common practice that reduces the additional effort required to implement multiple methods and reduces the risk that differences between method-specific detection parameters are confounded by other environmental factors. We develop occupancy and spatial capture-recapture models that permit covariance between the detections produced by different methods, use simulation to compare estimator performance of the new models to models assuming independence, and provide an empirical application based on American marten (Martes americana) surveys using paired remote cameras, hair catches, and snow tracking. Simulation results indicate existing models that assume that methods independently detect organisms produce biased parameter estimates and substantially understate estimate uncertainty when this assumption is violated, while our reformulated models are robust to either methodological independence or covariance. Empirical results suggested that remote cameras and snow tracking had comparable probability of detecting present martens, but that snow tracking also produced false-positive marten detections that could potentially substantially bias distribution estimates if not corrected for. Remote cameras detected marten individuals more readily than passive hair catches. Inability to photographically distinguish individual sex did not appear to induce negative bias in camera density estimates; instead, hair catches appeared to produce detection competition between individuals that may have been a source of negative bias. Our model reformulations broaden the range of circumstances in which analyses incorporating multiple sources of information can be robustly used, and our empirical results demonstrate that using multiple field-methods can enhance inferences regarding ecological parameters of interest and improve understanding of how reliably survey methods sample these parameters.},

  abstract = {A critical requirement in the ecological management of fire is knowledge of the age-class distribution of the vegetation. Such knowledge is important because it underpins the distribution of ecological features important to plants and animals including retreat sites, food sources and foraging microhabitats. However, in many regions, knowledge of the ageclass distribution of vegetation is severely constrained by the limited data available on fire history. Much fire-history mapping is restricted to post-1972 fires, following satellite imagery becoming widely available. To investigate fire history in the semi-arid Murray Mallee region in southern Australia, we developed regression models for six species of mallee eucalypt (Eucalyptus oleosa F.Muell. ex. Miq. subsp. oleosa, E. leptophylla F.Muell. ex. Miq., E. dumosa J. Oxley, E. costata subsp. murrayana L. A. S. Johnson \& K. D. Hill, E. gracilis F.Muell. and E. socialis F.Muell. ex. Miq.) to quantify the relationship between mean stem diameter and stem age (indicated by fire-year) at sites of known time since fire. We then used these models to predict mean stem age, and thus infer fire-year, for sites where the time since fire was not known. Validation of the models with independent data revealed a highly significant correlation between the actual and predicted time since fire (r = 0.71, P {$<$} 0.001, n = 88), confirming the utility of this method for ageing stands of mallee eucalypt vegetation. Validation data suggest the models provide a conservative estimate of the age of a site (i.e. they may under-estimate the minimum age of sites {$>$}35 years since fire). Nevertheless, this approach enables examination of post-fire chronosequences in semi-arid mallee ecosystems to be extended from 35 years post-fire to over 100 years. The predicted ages identified for mallee stands imply a need for redefining what is meant by ‘old-growth’ mallee, and challenges current perceptions of an over-abundance of ‘long-unburnt’ mallee vegetation. Given the strong influence of fire on semi-arid mallee vegetation, this approach offers the potential for a better understanding of long-term successional dynamics and the status of biota in an ecosystem that encompasses more than 250 000 km2 of southern Australia.},

  abstract = {Distance sampling is a technique for estimating the abundance of animals or other objects in a region, allowing for imperfect detection. This paper evaluates the statistical efficiency of the method when its assumptions are met, both theoretically and by simulation. The theoretical component of the paper is a derivation of the asymptotic variance penalty for the distance sampling estimator arising from uncertainty about the unknown detection parameters. This asymptotic penalty factor is tabulated for several detection functions. It is typically at least 2 but can be much higher, particularly for steeply declining detection rates. The asymptotic result relies on a model which makes the strong assumption that objects are uniformly distributed across the region. The simulation study relaxes this assumption by incorporating over-dispersion when generating object locations. Distance sampling and strip transect estimators are calculated for simulated data, for a variety of overdispersion factors, detection functions, sample sizes and strip widths. The simulation results confirm the theoretical asymptotic penalty in the non-overdispersed case. For a more realistic overdispersion factor of 2, distance sampling estimation outperforms strip transect estimation when a half-normal distance function is correctly assumed, confirming previous literature. When the hazard rate model is correctly assumed, strip transect estimators have lower mean squared error than the usual distance sampling estimator when the strip width is close enough to its optimal value (+/- 75\% when there are 100 detections; +/- 50\% when there are 200 detections). Whether the ecologist can set the strip width sufficiently accurately will depend on the circumstances of each particular study.},

In particular, if highly mobile taxa are frequently absent from survey locations, methods that estimate a probability of detection conditional on presence will generate biased abundance estimates. Here, we propose a new estimator for estimating abundance of mobile populations using telemetry and counts of unmarked animals. The estimator assumes that the target population conforms to a fission-fusion grouping pattern, in which the population is divided into groups that frequently change in size and composition. If assumptions are met, it is not necessary to locate all groups in the population to estimate abundance. We derive an estimator, perform a simulation study, conduct a power analysis, and apply the method to field data. The simulation study confirmed that our estimator is asymptotically unbiased with low bias, narrow confidence intervals, and good coverage, given a modest survey effort. The power analysis provided initial guidance on survey effort. When applied to small data sets obtained by radio-tracking Indiana bats, abundance estimates were reasonable, although imprecise. The proposed method has the potential to improve abundance estimates for mobile species that have a fission-fusion social structure, such as Indiana bats, because it does not condition detection on presence at survey locations and because it avoids certain restrictive assumptions.},

  abstract = {Despite widespread recognition of the major threat to tropical forest biological diversity and local food security posed by unsustainable bushmeat hunting, virtually no long-term studies tracking the socioecological dynamics of hunting systems have been conducted. We interviewed local hunters and collected detailed hunting data to investigate changes in offtake and hunter characteristics over 10 years (20012010) in Dibouka and Kouagna villages, central Gabon, in the context of hunter recollections of longer term trends since the 1950s. To control for changes in hunter behavior, such as trap location and characteristics, we report hunting offtake data per trap. Our results suggest the hunting area was already highly depleted by 2001; local hunters reported that 16 large-bodied prey species had become rare or locally extirpated over the last 60 years. Overall, we observed no significant declines in hunting offtake or changes in species composition from 2001 to 2010, and offtakes per trap increased slightly between 2004 and 2010. However, trapping distance from the villages increased, and there was a switch in hunting techniques; a larger proportion of the catch was hunted with guns in 2010. The number of hunters declined by 20\% from 2004 to 2010, and male livelihood activities shifted away from hunting. Hunters with the lowest hunting incomes in 2004 were more likely than successful hunters to have moved away from the village by 2010 (often in response to alternative employment opportunities). Therefore, changes in trap success (potentially related to biological factors) were interacting with system-level changes in hunter number and composition (related to external socioeconomic factors) to produce a relatively static overall offtake. Our results highlight the importance of understanding the small-scale context of hunting to correctly interpret changes or apparent stasis in hunting effort and offtake over time.},

Estimates are needed to assess population responses to management actions, and whether recovery objectives have been met. Aerial surveys have been conducted since 1976, but none adjusted for imperfect detection. We summarize surveys since 1976, report on current distribution, and provide population estimates after accounting for apparent detection probability for surveys between June 2010 and March 2014. Estimates in areas of high concentration (hotspots) averaged 317 101, three times higher than unadjusted counts (104 +/- 0.56). Adjusted estimates in three areas outside hotspots also differed markedly from counts (75 +/- 9.89 versus 19.5 +/- 3.5). Average minimum island-wide estimate was 386 +/- 89, similar to the maximum estimate of 360 suggested in 2005, but fewer than the 700 recently suggested by the Puerto Rico Manatee Conservation Center. Manatees were more widespread than previously understood. Improving estimates, locally or island-wide, will require stratifying the island differently and greater knowledge about factors affecting detection probability. Sharing our protocol with partners in nearby islands (e.g., Cuba, Jamaica, Hispaniola), whose populations share genetic make-up, would contribute to enhanced regional conservation through better population estimates and tracking range expansion. El manejo efectivo del manati antillano amenazado en Puerto Rico requiere estimados de tamanos de poblaciones confiables. Dichas estimaciones poblacionales son necesarias para evaluar las respuestas a las acciones de manejo, y para determinar si los objetivos de recuperacion han sido alcanzados. Se han realizado censos aereos desde 1976, pero ninguno de ellos han sido ajustados para detecciones imperfectas. Aqui resumimos los censos desde 1976, actualizamos la distribucion, y reportamos los primeros estimados poblacionales ajustados para la probabilidad de deteccion aparente en los censos de Junio 2010 a Marzo 2014. Las estimaciones poblacionales en areas de mayor concentracion del manati promedio 317 +/- 103, tres veces mas abundante que los conteos sin ajuste (104 +/- 0.56). Las estimaciones poblacionales en tres areas fuera de las areas de mayor concentracion del manati tambien fueron marcadamente diferentes (75 +/- 9.89 vs 19.5 +/- 3.5). El estimado minimo poblacional en la isla entera fue de 386 +/- 89, similar al estimado maximo de 360 sugerido en el ano 2005, pero menor a los 700 sugeridos recientemente por el Centro de Conservacion de Manaties de Puerto Rico. Documentamos que el manati tiene una distribucion mas amplia de lo que se sabia con anterioridad. El mejoramiento de los estimados poblacionales locales o a nivel de isla requerira que se estratifique a la isla en forma diferente y que se investiguen los factores que influencian a la probabilidad de deteccion. Compartir protocolos como este con colaboradores de islas vecinas (por. ej., Cuba, Jamaica, Espanola), cuyas poblaciones de manaties comparten material genetico, contribuiria a la conservacion regional mediante mejores estimaciones poblacionales y monitoreo de la expansion de su ambito domestico.},

We surveyed 200-400 point-count locations across approximately 30 private properties annually from 2005 to 2008. We used data from our surveyed patches (n = 147) and the Psi (occupancy), p (detection), and gamma = 1 - epsilon parameterization to estimate patch dynamics and associated detection probabilities for golden-cheeked warblers. Patch size had a strong association with patch occupancy, and all patches ¿160 ha were predicted to be occupied. We found no evidence that large golden-cheeked warbler populations located on public lands in the vicinity of our study area influenced occupancy dynamics. We conducted simulations across a range of detection probabilities to evaluate potential sample sizes for both standard-and removal-based occupancy modeling. Simulations using parameter estimates from our analysis indicated that removal-based sampling is superior to standard sampling. Based on our results, surveying golden-cheeked warbler presence in oak-juniper (Quercus-Juniperus) patches under a removal modeling framework should be considered as one alternative for range-wide monitoring programs because patch-level monitoring would be necessary to estimate proportion of range occupied. Large contiguous patches are rare across the species' range; hence, conservation and management of the mosaic of smaller patches within a landscape context would be required for maintaining species viability. Thus, we recommend the identification of areas where smaller, contiguous patches represent a significant portion of the available habitat within the local landscape and targeting these areas for habitat maintenance and improvement.},

We used Program DISTANCE to estimate dove densities at survey points and to test whether certain land cover types were associated with greater dove densities. Our results indicated white-winged dove occurrence in South Texas was positively associated with urban land and cropland, whereas mourning dove occurrence was positively associated with cropland. For land cover types found to be associated with dove presence, estimated density for each dove species increased as the proportion of associated land cover type increased. These results can assist wildlife biologists in the development of a more efficient and targeted protocol for censusing doves.

Countless methods for estimating these parameters exist, making it essential to assess the limitations and biases associated with a particular sampling protocol. Here, we compare between 2 methods commonly used to survey nearshore fish assemblages. Although most commonly employed, underwater visual census (UVC) may yield biased estimates of abundance depending on the strength of a fish's behavioural response (i.e. avoidance, attraction) to the presence of divers. Baited remote underwater video (BRUV) techniques have shown promise in overcoming some of the limitations of UVC, but are unable to provide an absolute measure of density in turbulent environments. We compare the abilities of these 2 methods to survey the nearshore rocky reef ichthyofauna of Southeast Australia. We found that relative to BRUV, UVC recorded more individuals (in terms of all species, herbivores, cryptic species, and most territorial species), higher richness at both the species and family level, and higher biodiversity as measured using the Shannon Index. These findings remain even when the data were adjusted for differences in sampling effort. In contrast, BRUV recorded proportionally more mobile predators, and a more taxonomically distinct population, though only when taxonomic evenness was not taken into account. Twenty species were unique to UVC and 17 species unique to BRUV. Considering this, studies aimed at cataloguing diversity should apply multiple methods, However, when logistical or financial constraints limit biodiversity studies to only 1 method, UVC will likely provide a more complete estimate of temperate reef fish diversity than BRUV.},

Our largest databases include {$>$}2 million measurements, and each has a master version on a server where all collaborators can access and edit data. This paper focuses on the data requirements for handling tree census data and how to design databases to meet these requirements and to ensure data integrity. There are six key elements of a tree census which the database must reflect: (1) measurements, including individual trees (genetic units), stems within trees, and multiple measurements of stems; both field and data methods must assure that every tree, stem, and measurement is precisely identified and can be relocated easily; (2) coordinates, including quadrats within a plot, because field mapping is usually done by assigning x–y coordinates relative to local quadrat markers; (3) taxonomy, carrying a species identity for every tree with a history of individual re-identifications; (4) personnel, with records of the people who performed field and data work per quadrat; (5) assessment of field error via random re-measurements; and (6) a log of changes and a system of archiving so that errors can be tracked and past versions can be reconstructed and cited in publications. A well-designed database model reduces a variety of integrity errors and improves access to data tables in identical formats across many plots, allowing data analyses to be easily replicated and results to be compared. The principal disadvantage is that complexity of the database requires experienced data managers.},

  abstract = {Ecologists often use transect surveys to estimate the density and abundance of animal populations. Errors in species classification are often evident in such surveys, yet few statistical methods exist to properly account for them. In this paper, we examine biases that result from species misidentification when ignored, and we develop statistical models to provide unbiased estimates of density in the face of such errors. Our approach treats true species identity as a latent variable and requires auxiliary information on the misclassification process (such as informative priors, experiments using known species, or a double-observer protocol). We illustrate our approach with simulated census data and with double-observer survey data for ice-associated seals in the Bering Sea. For the seal analysis, we integrated misclassification into a model-based framework for distance-sampling data. The simulated data analysis demonstrated reliable estimation of animal density when there are experimental data to inform misclassification rates; double-observer protocols provided robust inference when there were unknown species observations but no outright misclassification, or when misclassification probabilities were symmetric and a symmetry constraint was imposed during estimation. Under our modeling framework, we obtained reasonable apparent densities of seal species even under considerable imprecision in species identification. We obtained more reliable inferences when modeling variation in density among transects. We argue that ecologists should often use spatially explicit models to account for differences in species distributions when trying to account for species misidentification. Our results support using double-observer sampling protocols that guard against species misclassification (i.e., by recording uncertain observations as unknown).},

  abstract = {Many organisms are patchily distributed, with some patches occupied at high density, others at lower densities, and others not occupied. Estimation of overall abundance can be difficult and is inefficient via intensive approaches such as capture-mark-recapture (CMR) or distance sampling. We propose a two-phase sampling scheme and model in a Bayesian framework to estimate abundance for patchily distributed populations. In the first phase, occupancy is estimated by binomial detection samples taken on all selected sites, where selection may be of all sites available, or a random sample of sites. Detection can be by visual surveys, detection of sign, physical captures, or other approach. At the second phase, if a detection threshold is achieved, CMR or other intensive sampling is conducted via standard procedures (grids or webs) to estimate abundance. Detection and CMR data are then used in a joint likelihood to model probability of detection in the occupancy sample via an abundance detection model. CMR modeling is used to estimate abundance for the abundance-detection relationship, which in turn is used to predict abundance at the remaining sites, where only detection data are collected. We present a full Bayesian modeling treatment of this problem, in which posterior inference on abundance and other parameters (detection, capture probability) is obtained under a variety of assumptions about spatial and individual sources of heterogeneity. We apply the approach to abundance estimation for two species of voles (Microtus spp.) in Montana, USA. We also use a simulation study to evaluate the frequentist properties of our procedure given known patterns in abundance and detection among sites as well as design criteria. For most population characteristics and designs considered, bias and mean-square error (MSE) were low, and coverage of true parameter values by Bayesian credibility intervals was near nominal. Our two-phase, adaptive approach allows efficient estimation of abundance of rare and patchily distributed species and is particularly appropriate when sampling in all patches is impossible, but a global estimate of abundance is required.},

A standardized survey and monitoring program is not available to quantity changes in abundance or distribution. Before a standardized survey method is selected for long-term, continent-wide burrowing owl monitoring, potential survey protocols should be rigorously tested. We evaluated 3 potential burrowing owl survey methods: line transect, roadside point-count, and driving surveys. We also examined the effectiveness of using call-broadcasts on point-count surveys to increase detection probability. We conducted 3 replicate burrowing owl surveys (either point-count or driving surveys) along 1,350 kin of roads (114 survey routes) in eastern Wyoming, USA, between June and August 2000. Detection probability varied among observers for both point-count and driving surveys. Detection probability was higher on point-count surveys ((x) over bar = 64.3\%) compared to driving surveys ((x) over bar = 37.5\%), and point-count surveys sampled a larger effective area away from the road. Walking line-transect Surveys proved ineffective and inefficient for monitoring burrowing owls at large (statewide) scales. Nest-site detection probability was 47\% during driving detection trials and 79\% during point-count detection trials. We detected over twice as many owls per unit distance on our point-count routes (0.038 owls/km) compared to our driving routes (0.016 owls/km), but detected more owls per unit Lime on our driving routes (0.339 owls/hr vs. 0.229 owls/hr on point-count routes). We detected 22\% more Owls using call-broadcast even though all of our detections on point-count surveys were visual rather than aural. Estimates of breeding density were fairly similar based on our driving and point-count surveys (0.110 and 0.074 nest sites/km(2), respectively). Standardized point-counts using call-broadcast along roadsides offer the best approach for monitoring population trends of burrowing owls at large (statewide) spatial scales. Based on our results, we developed a standardized survey protocol for monitoring burrowing owls at large spatial scales. Implementation of these monitoring protocols would provide more precise estimates of population trends of burrowing owls in North America.},

  abstract = {Many species of marsh birds (e.g. rails and bitterns) are believed to be declining in North America, yet we lack an effective monitoring program to estimate their population trends. Broadcast of prerecorded calls to elicit vocalizations is a commonly used method in surveys of marsh birds, but whether gains in detection and index precision outweigh the drawbacks of call-broadcast is unclear. To evaluate the effectiveness of call-broadcast surveys, we pooled marsh-bird survey data from 8,047 point-count surveys contributed by 11 cooperators and compared numbers of birds detected and variation in numbers detected between call-broadcast and passive surveys. For most rails (particularly Virginia Rails [Rallus limicola]), call-broadcast surveys were effective at increasing the detection probability (e.g. average number of Virginia Rails detected per occupied point was 1.25 for call-broadcast surveys and 0.17 for passive surveys). The proportion of points at which no birds were detected was high for all species (range 74-99\%) and was slightly lower on call-broadcast surveys as compared with passive surveys. Coefficient of variation (CV) among replicate surveys was higher for passive surveys, particularly for rails (average CV in number of birds detected per point was 209\% for passive Surveys and 189\% for call-broadcast surveys). On the basis of those results, we recommend a marsh-bird monitoring protocol that includes an initial passive period followed by a period of call-broadcast to provide survey data that incorporate the benefits while avoiding the drawbacks of call-broadcast. We also recommend separating both the passive and the call-broadcast periods into 1-min subsegments that will allow estimates of components of detection probability within the monitoring effort.},

The number of black rails detected was 13\% higher on call-broadcast surveys compared to passive surveys, but the number of other marsh birds (bitterns and other species of rails) detected was 21\% lower. We detected more black rails on evening surveys compared to morning surveys, but we had to cancel 42\% of evening surveys due to high wind (¿25 km/hr). Detection probability increased from 0500 to 0700 hr and then declined as the morning progressed, but detection probabilities did not vary among hourly time intervals during evening surveys. We failed to detect an effect of broadcast volume on number of black rails detected during paired surveys. Observer detection probability of black rails ((x) over bar = 75.5\%) varied among observers but did not differ between passive and call-broadcast surveys. We failed to find a consistent time of year when detection probability was highest at all of our survey locations. We heard the 3 most common black rail calls in consistent proportion from March through June. As many as 15 replicate surveys may be needed to attain ¿90\% detection probability of black rails within potential wetland habitat. We recommend that standardized black rail surveys be repeated annually to provide more precise estimates of population trend and to better determine the distribution and status of this rare species.},

Large flood events are now rare in the lower basins of most large river systems due to flood control structures. Endemic organisms that are adapted to this historical disturbance regime have become less abundant due to these dramatic changes in the hydrology and the resultant changes in vegetation structure. The Yuma Clapper Rail is a federally endangered bird that breeds in emergent marshes within the lower Colorado River basin in the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. We evaluated whether prescribed fire could be used as a surrogate disturbance event to help restore historical conditions for the benefit of Yuma Clapper Rails and four sympatric marsh-dependent birds. We conducted call-broadcast surveys for marsh birds within burned and unburned (control) plots both pre- and post-burn. Fire increased the numbers of Yuma Clapper Rails and Virginia Rails, and did not affect the numbers of Black Rails, Soras, and Least Bitterns. We found no evidence that detection probability of any of the five species differed between burn and control plots. Our results suggest that prescribed fire can be used to set back succession of emergent marshlands and help mimic the natural disturbance regime in the lower Colorado River basin. Hence, prescribed fire can be used to help increase Yuma Clapper Rail populations without adversely affecting sympatric species. Implementing a coordinated long-term fire management plan within marshes of the lower Colorado River may allow regulatory agencies to remove the Yuma Clapper Rail from the endangered species list.},

The original survey protocol has been revised to provide greater clarification on many issues as the number of individuals using the protocol has grown. The Standardized North American Marsh Bird Monitoring Protocol instructs surveyors to conduct an initial 5-minute passive point-count survey followed by a series of 1-minute segments during which marsh bird calls are broadcast into the marsh following a standardized approach. Surveyors are instructed to record each individual bird from the suite of 26 focal species that are present in their local area on separate lines of a datasheet and estimate the distance to each bird. Also, surveyors are required to record whether each individual bird was detected within each 1-minute subsegment of the survey. These data allow analysts to use several different approaches for estimating detection probability. The Standardized North American Marsh Bird Monitoring Protocol provides detailed instructions that explain the field methods used to monitor marsh birds in North America.

  abstract = {Most efforts to link remote sensing to species distributions and movement have focused on indirect estimates of traits based on components of physiological and functional biodiversity. Such a view reflects one perspective on the general needs (habitat) of species. However, information on the vertical and horizontal structure of habitat may play a critical role in defining what a suitable habitat is. The development and application of highly accurate airborne laser scanning (ALS) systems, which are capable of describing the three-dimensional distribution of vegetation, have significant potential value in deriving quantitative relationships between species distributions and their habitat structure. In this paper we review the use of ALS for biodiversity studies, and propose a three-dimensional index which captures the three main components of vertical and horizontal vegetation structure: height, cover, and complexity. Once developed, we apply the index across the forested area of the Canadian province of Alberta, and compare and contrast the differences across natural subregions and land cover types. We also demonstrate how the index can be used with biodiversity data, in this case examining patterns in avian species richness. We conclude with a discussion on the potential use of the habitat structure index with other biodiversity-related research.},

For instance, researchers monitor relatively small and disjunct populations of prairie sharp-tailed grouse Tympanuchus phasisanellus campestris in Michigan, Wisconsin, and Minnesota using different lek count protocols. Some of these state-led monitoring efforts include the widespread use of volunteers who conduct lek counts without training. To facilitate discussions regarding standardizing sharp-tailed grouse lek count protocols in the Upper Midwest and elsewhere, we quantified the magnitude of differences in data arising from lek counts conducted by paired observers and examined factors potentially associated with observer bias (e.g., training type, use of optical equipment, experience). During 2010-2015, 44 unique pairs of formally trained volunteers in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan performed 93 counts at one lek while controlling for weather, distance to the lek, and the timing of observations. All counts consisted of six 1 min observations over 1 h. At three leks in northeastern Minnesota during 2015, nine pairs (consisting of an individual new to lek counts and a more experienced biologist) performed 21 lek counts using the same protocols, but without formal training for novice observers. Across all years and all sites, our results consistently indicated more agreement in data for dancing birds than nondancing birds. Overall, the mean +/- SE difference between paired observers for total birds (dancing and nondancing combined) was 1.05 +/- 0.09 in Michigan and 0.37 +/- 0.08 in Minnesota. Generalized linear models indicated that the use of optical equipment and training type for dancing birds and training type for nondancing birds were significant factors that improved data agreement in Michigan. In Minnesota, models indicated that experience level (number of surveys performed) of the technician or volunteer did not affect count differences for dancing birds or nondancing birds. We contend that using behavior as a proxy for sex can bias lek count data for sharp-tailed grouse. We suggest lek count protocols in the Upper Midwest be simplified and standardized. Specifically, we suggest that observers report the total number of observed birds (regardless of behavior) and that protocols establish a set duration of observation. We also suggest that the use of optical equipment be required and that training be mandatory.},

  abstract = {Obtaining reliable information on animal abundance in mountainous landscapes is challenging. Highly heterogeneous habitats tend to reduce detection probabilities, and the three-dimensional, rugged nature of the terrain poses severe limits to the fulfilment of a number of assumptions underlying several statistical methods. In this study, we compared the performance of 4 methods to estimate population size of Alpine marmot (Marmota marmota), a highly social semifossorial rodent widely distributed on the European Alps. Between May and August 2015, in a study area within the Stelvio National Park (Italy), we conducted 8 sessions of capture-mark-recapture, 6 sessions of mark-resight from vantage points, 8 sessions of line distance sampling along 4 transects, and 2 sessions using double-observer methods from vantage points. The minimum number of animals alive, obtained during the mark-resight surveys, was n=54 individuals. Capture-mark-recapture models estimated a population size of n=56 individuals (95\% CI=45-87); similar, but more precise estimates were obtained with the mark-resight approach (Bowden's estimator: n=62, 95\% CI=54-71; Poisson log-normal estimator: n=62, 95\% CI=55-69). Line transect distance sampling and double-observer methods were severely biased low (line transect distance sampling: n=24 individuals, 95\% CI=19-31; independent double-observer: n=24, 95\% CI=22-35; dependent doubleobserver: n=15, 95\% CI=15-20). Our results suggest that the probabilistic approach based on marked individuals yielded fairly robust estimates of population size. The underestimates obtained using distance sampling and double-observer methods were likely due to the violation of some underlying assumptions. While the topography of the mountainous landscape makes it difficult to randomize the distribution of line transects, the burrowing behaviour of the species is likely to violate the assumption of perfect detection on the transect; in addition, the semifossorial habits of marmots lower their detection probabilities, thus hampering the performance of these methods.},

  abstract = {Population size estimates represent indispensable tools for many research programs and for conservation or management issues. Mountain ungulates in open areas are often surveyed through ground counts that normally underestimate population size. While the use of sample counts is desirable, few studies have compared different probabilistic approaches to estimate population size in this taxon. We compared the size estimates of a male population of Alpine chamois using mark-resight and line transect sampling methods, while block counts were used to obtain the minimum number of males alive in the study area. Surveys were conducted within the Gran Paradiso National Park (Italy), in August–September 2013, using block counts along purposely selected trails and vantage points, mark-resight over 5 consecutive resightings from vantage points and trails, and line transect sampling along 12 transects repeated 8 times. Block counts yielded a minimum number of males alive in the population of n = 72 individuals. This value was greater than the upper bound of the 95 \% confidence interval achieved using line transect sampling n = 54, CV = 14 \% [95 \% CI (40, 71)] while mark-resight yielded a more realistic result of n = 93 individuals CV = 18 \% [95 \% CI (63, 137)]. Our results suggest that line transect sampling performed poorly in the Alpine environment, leading to underestimates of population size, likely due to violations of some assumptions imposed by the rugged nature of the terrain. The mark-resight yielded lower precision, possibly due to the limited number of marked individuals and resighting occasions, but it provided robustness and accurate estimates as marks were evenly distributed among animals.},

  abstract = {We captured mongooses (Herpestes javanicus) in live traps arranged in trapping webs in Antigua, West Indies, and used capture-recapture and distance sampling to estimate density. Distance estimation and program DISTANCE were used to provide estimates of density from the trapping-web data. Mean density based on trapping webs was 9.5 mongooses/ha (range, 5.9-10.2/ha); estimates had coefficients of variation ranging from 29.82-31.58\% ((X) over bar = 30.46\%). Mark-recapture models were used to estimate abundance, which was converted to density using estimates of effective trap area. Tests of model assumptions provided by CAPTURE indicated pronounced heterogeneity in capture probabilities and some indication of behavioral response and variation over time. Mean estimated density was 1.80 mongooses/ha (range, 1.37-2.15/ha) with estimated coefficients of variation of 4.68-11.92\% ((X) over bar = 7.46\%). Estimates of density based on mark-recapture data depended heavily on assumptions about animal home ranges; variances of densities also may be underestimated, leading to unrealistically narrow confidence intervals. Estimates based on trap webs require fewer assumptions, and estimated variances may be a more realistic representation of sampling variation. Because trap webs are established easily and provide adequate data for estimation in a few sample occasions, the method should be efficient and reliable for estimating densities of mongooses.},

  abstract = {Selective logging is the most prevalent land-use change in the tropics. Despite the resulting degradation of forest structure, selectively logged forests still harbor a substantial amount of biodiversity leading to suggestions that their protection is the next best alternative to conserving primary, old-growth forests. Restoring carbon stocks under Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+) schemes is a potential method for obtaining funding to protect logged forests, via enrichment planting and liberation cutting of vines. This study investigates the impacts of restoring logged forests in Borneo on avian phylogenetic diversity, the total evolutionary history shared across all species within a community, and on functional diversity, with important implications for the protection of evolutionarily unique species and the provision of many ecosystem services. Overall and understorey avifaunal communities were studied using point count and mist netting surveys, respectively. Restoration caused a significant loss in phylogenetic diversity and MPD (mean pairwise distance) leaving an overall bird community of less total evolutionary history and more closely related species compared to unlogged forests, while the understorey bird community had MNTD (mean nearest taxon distance) that returned toward the lower levels found in a primary forest, indicating more closely related species pairs. The overall bird community experienced a significant loss of functional strategies and species with more specialized traits in restored forests compared to that of unlogged forests, which led to functional clustering in the community. Restoration also led to a reduction in functional richness and thus niches occupied in the understorey bird community compared to unlogged forests. While there are additional benefits of restoration for forest regeneration, carbon sequestration, future timber harvests, and potentially reduced threat of forest conversion, this must be weighed against the apparent loss of phylogenetic and functional diversity from unlogged forest levels, making the biodiversity-friendliness of carbon sequestration schemes questionable under future REDD+ agreements. To reduce perverse biodiversity outcomes, it is important to focus restoration only on the most degraded areas or at reduced intensity where breaks between regimes are incorporated.},

  abstract = {Road mortality due to animal vehicle collisions has serious negative effects on population viability, demanding urgent implementation of mitigation measures where most required. Data from roadkill surveys is generally used to choose the best mitigation measures, but there is a lack of knowledge about the sampling intensity required for surveys to effectively detect roadkill patterns. Improving the cost-effectiveness of road surveys could free up limited resources that, in turn, could be used to obtain a better perception of road impacts and mitigation effectiveness elsewhere. We evaluate the possibility of improving road survey cost-effectiveness by comparing the spatial patterns obtained when using a weekly versus monthly survey and year-round versus seasonal surveys. We analyzed a roadkill dataset, previously collected over 2 years in southern Brazil, and applied two criteria for assessing the effectiveness of two alternative survey protocols: tradeoff between sampling effort and sample size; and similarity in spatial patterns. We found support favoring monthly surveys for those taxa in which roadkill was not markedly temporally clustered, as was the case for larger mammals. However, performing weekly surveys over shorter periods may significantly improve cost-effectiveness for taxa with peaks in mortality if surveys are performed during those periods when roadkill is most likely to occur. We suggest applying a mix of sampling protocols, with intensive surveys during warmer periods for reptiles and other taxa with peak roadkill at these times while, for the rest of the year, a monthly survey could be used to improve detection of rarer species.},

  abstract = {Information on population abundance is important to correctly plan conservation and management of animal populations. In general, capture-mark-recapture (CMR) is considered the most robust technique to estimate population abundance, but it is costly in terms of time and effort. Recently, binomial N-mixture models, based on counts of unmarked individuals, have been widely employed to estimate abundance. These models have limits and their reliability has been criticized. In the majority of cases, multinomial N-mixture models based on multiple observer protocols, that are hierarchical extensions of simple CMR, are applied in estimating abundance of animals with large body size, conspicuous behavior or high detection probabilities. We applied and evaluated the reliability of a multinomial N-mixture modelling approach with multiple observer data to a small and cryptic terrestrial salamander, found in different habitats where populations possess different level of detectability. Estimates obtained with multinomial N-mixture models were compared to estimates obtained with classical methods, such as removal sampling, and their reliability has also been evaluated by simulations scenarios. Our results show that multinomial N-mixture models, applied within a multiple observer framework, give reliable and robust estimates of population abundance even when detection and density are relatively low. Therefore, multinomial N-mixture models appear efficient and cost-effective when planning and identifying management actions and conservation programs of small terrestrial animals such as amphibians and reptiles.},

  abstract = {Although dramatic amphibian declines have been documented worldwide, only few of such events have been quantitatively documented for the tropical forests of South America. This is due partly to the fact that tropical amphibians are patchily distributed and difficult to detect. We tested three methods often used to monitor population trends in amphibian species in a remote lowland tropical forest of French Guiana. These methods are capture-mark-recapture (CMR), estimation of the number of calling males with repeated counts data and distance sampling, and rates of occupancy inferred by presence/absence data. We monitored eight diurnal, terrestrial amphibian species including five Dendrobatidae and three Bufonidae. We found that CMR, the most precise way of estimating population size, can be used only with two species in high density patches where the recapture rate is high enough. Only for one of the species (Dendrobates tinctorius), a low coefficient of variation (CV = 0.19) can be achieved with 15 to 20 capture events. For dendrobatid species with day-calling males, audio surveys yield a better probability of detection with only 8 audio surveys needed; quantitative estimates can be achieved by computing the number of calling males inferred from audio counts or distance sampling analysis. We therefore suggest that an efficient monitoring protocol for Neotropical amphibian species should include a combination of sighting and audio techniques, and we discuss the need of implementing a large-scale monitoring in order to provide a baseline for comparison with future changes.},

  abstract = {Abstract Context Determining population size or density is often fundamental for wildlife conservation. For nocturnal species, indices are commonly used in place of abundance estimates, with spotlighting indices (e.g. sighting rate per km) being prevalent. Distance sampling is a collection of techniques that provide estimates of wildlife abundance from line-transect data, by correcting raw counts for imperfect detection. These methods have rarely been used to assess the abundance of nocturnal arboreal mammals. Aims To develop and evaluate a method for estimating the abundance and density of nocturnal arboreal mammals using double-observer distance sampling, and to apply the approach to a survey of the southern greater glider (Petauroides volans) in the Strathbogie Ranges, Victoria, Australia. Methods Two observers, 15–20 min apart, surveyed 25 randomly located 500 m transects, and recorded greater gliders using spotlights and binoculars. Densities and abundances were derived from the line-transect data by using mark–recapture distance sampling (MRDS) models and were compared with conventional distance sampling analysis (CDS). Key results Using the double-observer approach, we estimated an overall density of 0.96 gliders ha−1 (95\% CI 0.60–1.50), giving a population estimate of 24 575 greater gliders across the Strathbogie Ranges (25 865 ha, 95\% CI 15 620–38 661). The corresponding estimates for the study area derived using CDS applied to either both observers’ observations or to the first observer’s observations only, were 87\% and 53\% respectively, of the MRDS estimate. The analysis confirmed that the probability of detection of gliders along the transect line was less than one, justifying the use of the double-observer method to obtain accurate estimates of abundance. Conclusions The low detectability of greater gliders means that uncorrected spotlight counts will underestimate abundance, as will CDS. The double-observer method corrects for the negative bias associated with raw counts, enabling more accurate estimation of abundance for survey, monitoring and management purposes. Implications We recommend that double-observer distance sampling is adopted as a standard technique for estimating the abundance of greater gliders. The double-observer method potentially has wider relevance for assessing population size of other arboreal mammals, providing the assumptions of the approach can be met.},

In a field test in Queen Elizabeth Protected Area, Uganda, we increased detections of illegal activities in some cases by over 250\% without a change in ranger resources. This easily implemented method can be used in any protected area where data on the distribution of illegal activities are collected, and improve law-enforcement efficiency in resource-limited settings.},

Understanding the patterns and extent of illegal activities is therefore essential for effective law enforcement and prevention of biodiversity declines. We used extensive data, commonly collected by ranger patrols in many protected areas, and Bayesian hierarchical models to identify drivers, trends, and distribution of multiple illegal activities within the Queen Elizabeth Conservation Area (QECA), Uganda. Encroachment (e.g., by pastoralists with cattle) and poaching of noncommercial animals (e.g., snaring bushmeat) were the most prevalent illegal activities within the QECA. Illegal activities occurred in different areas of the QECA. Poaching of noncommercial animals was most widely distributed within the national park. Overall, ecological covariates, although significant, were not useful predictors for occurrence of illegal activities. Instead, the location of illegal activities in previous years was more important. There were significant increases in encroachment and noncommercial plant harvesting (nontimber products) during the study period (1999-2012). We also found significant spatiotemporal variation in the occurrence of all activities. Our results show the need to explicitly model ranger patrol effort to reduce biases from existing uncorrected or capture per unit effort analyses. Prioritization of ranger patrol strategies is needed to target illegal activities; these strategies are determined by protected area managers, and therefore changes at a site-level can be implemented quickly. These strategies should also be informed by the location of past occurrences of illegal activity: the most useful predictor of future events. However, because spatial and temporal changes in illegal activities occurred, regular patrols throughout the protected area, even in areas of low occurrence, are also required.},

  abstract = {Bushmeat hunting is extensive in west and central Africa as both a means for subsistence and for commercial gain. Commercial hunting represents one of the primary threats to wildlife in the region, and confounding factors have made it challenging to examine how external factors influence the commercial bushmeat trade. Bioko Island, Equatorial Guinea is a small island with large tracts of intact forest that support sizeable populations of commercially valuable vertebrates, especially endemic primates. The island also has a low human population and has experienced dramatic economic growth and rapid development since the mid-1990's. From October 1997 - September 2010, we monitored the largest bushmeat market on Bioko in Malabo, recording over 197,000 carcasses for sale. We used these data to analyze the dynamics of the market in relation to political events, environmental legislation, and rapid economic growth. Our findings suggest that bushmeat hunting and availability increased in parallel with the growth of Equatorial Guinea's GDP and disposable income of its citizens. During this 13-year study, the predominant mode of capture shifted from trapping to shotguns. Consequently, carcass volume and rates of taxa typically captured with shotguns increased significantly, most notably including intensified hunting of Bioko's unique and endangered monkey fauna. Attempts to limit bushmeat sales, including a 2007 ban on primate hunting and trade, were only transiently effective. The hunting ban was not enforced, and was quickly followed by a marked increase in bushmeat hunting compared to hunting rates prior to the ban. Our results emphasize the negative impact that rapid development and unenforced legislation have had on Bioko's wildlife, and demonstrate the need for strong governmental support if conservation strategies are to be successful at preventing extinctions of tropical wildlife.},

We found that surveying early in the nesting season was more likely to produce new owl detections compared to surveying later in the nesting season. New owls detected (hiring each of the three vocalization intervals (each consisting of 30 sec of vocalizations followed by 30 sec of silence) Of Our broadcasting Session were similar (37\%, 40\%, and 23\%; n = 30). We used a combination of detection trials (sighting probability) and double-observer method to estimate the components of detection probability, i.e., availability and perception. Availability for all sites and years, as determined by detection trials, ranged from 46.1\%-58.2\%. Relative abundance, measured as frequency of occurrence and defined as the proportion of surveys with at least one owl, ranged from 19.2\%-32.0\% for both sites and years. Density at our eastern Mojave Desert site wits estimated at 0.09 +/- 0.01 (SE) owl territories/km(2) and 0.16 +/- 0.02 (SE) owl territories/km(2) during 2003 and 2004, respectively. In Our southern Mojave Desert site, density estimates were 0.09 +/- 0.02 (SE) owl territories/km(2) and 0.08 +/- 0.02 (SE) owl territories/km(2) during 2004 and 2005, respectively.},

  abstract = {Accurate and precise abundance estimation is vital for informed wildlife conservation and management decision-making. Line transect surveys are a common sampling approach for abundance estimation. Distance sampling is often used to estimate abundance from line transect survey data; however, search encounter spatial capture-recapture can also be used when individuals in the population of interest are identifiable. The search encounter spatial capture-recapture model has rarely been applied, and its performance has not been compared to that of distance sampling. We analyzed simulated datasets to compare the performance of distance sampling and spatial capture-recapture abundance estimators. Additionally, we estimated the abundance of North Atlantic right whales in the southeastern United States with two formulations of each model and compared the estimates. Spatial capture-recapture abundance estimates had lower root mean squared error than distance sampling estimates. Spatial capture-recapture 95\% credible intervals for abundance had nominal coverage, i.e., contained the simulating value for abundance in 95\% of simulations, whereas distance sampling credible intervals had below nominal coverage. Moreover, North Atlantic right whale abundance estimates from distance sampling models were more sensitive to model specification compared to spatial capture-recapture estimates. When estimating abundance from line transect data, researchers should consider using search encounter spatial capture-recapture when individuals in the population of interest are identifiable, when line transects are surveyed over multiple occasions, when there is imperfect detection of individuals located on the line transect, and when it is safe to assume the population of interest is closed demographically. When line transects are surveyed over multiple occasions, researchers should be aware that individual space use may induce spatial autocorrelation in counts across transects. This is not accounted for in common distance sampling estimators and leads to overly precise abundance estimates.},

  abstract = {Louisiana's barrier islands provide unique habitats for waterbirds throughout the year. Unfortunately, barrier islands such as those within the Isles Derrieres Barrier Island Refuge (IDBIR) are rapidly degrading, and critical waterbird habitats are disappearing. The majority of waterbird research projects in the northern Gulf of Mexico have focused on important breeding habitats, but little information exists on preferred habitats during the nonbreeding wintering period. The goal of this study was to identify important waterbird habitats on barrier islands during the nonbreeding period to enhance barrier island management for year-round use by waterbirds. Biweekly surveys were conducted at the IDBIR during the 2010-2011 and 2011-2012 nonbreeding seasons to determine waterbird use of beach habitats. Habitat maps of the IDBIR were also created to calculate bird densities and species richness among habitat types, including bayside intertidal, flats, gulfside intertidal, nonintertidal, and rock structures. This study also quantified availability of food resources by collecting benthic core samples from substrates at each habitat type. Forty-seven waterbird species were observed during waterbird surveys. Wine Island had the greatest species richness and bird density (5.5 species/ha and 325.6 birds/ha) among the islands, as well as the greatest density of foraging waterbirds. Rock structures and gulfside intertidal habitats had the greatest species richness and bird densities among habitat types. East and West Raccoon islands and intertidal habitats had the greatest availability of invertebrate prey. There was a moderate correlation (r(2) = 0.32) between invertebrate biomass and abundance of foraging shorebirds. It is recommended that future restoration projects provide wide, expansive intertidal habitats to enhance critical wintering habitats for waterbirds.},

  abstract = {Many animal monitoring studies seek to estimate the proportion of a study area occupied by a target population. The study area is divided into spatially distinct sites where the detected presence or absence of the population is recorded, and this is repeated in time for multiple seasons. However, when occupied sites are detected with probability p ¡ 1, the lack of a detection does not imply lack of occupancy. MacKenzie etal. (2003, Ecology 84, 22002207) developed a multiseason model for estimating seasonal site occupancy (t) while accounting for unknown p. Their model performs well when observations are collected according to the robust design, where multiple sampling occasions occur during each season; the repeated sampling aids in the estimation p. However, their model does not perform as well when the robust design is lacking. In this paper, we propose an alternative likelihood model that yields improved seasonal estimates of p and t in the absence of the robust design. We construct the marginal likelihood of the observed data by conditioning on, and summing out, the latent number of occupied sites during each season. A simulation study shows that in cases without the robust design, the proposed model estimates p with less bias than the MacKenzie etal. model and hence improves the estimates of t. We apply both models to a data set consisting of repeated presenceabsence observations of American robins (Turdus migratorius) with yearly survey periods. The two models are compared to a third estimator available when the repeated counts (from the same study) are considered, with the proposed model yielding estimates of t closest to estimates from the point count model.},

  abstract = {Using only spatially and temporally replicated point counts, Royle (2004b, Biometrics 60, 108-115) developed an N-mixture model to estimate the abundance of an animal population when individual animal detection probability is unknown. One assumption inherent in this model is that the animal populations at each sampled location are closed with respect to migration, births, and deaths throughout the study. In the past this has been verified solely by biological arguments related to the study design as no statistical verification was available. In this article, we propose a generalization of the N-mixture model that can be used to formally test the closure assumption. Additionally, when applied to an open metapopulation, the generalized model provides estimates of population dynamics parameters and yields abundance estimates that account for imperfect detection probability and do not require the closure assumption. A simulation study shows these abundance estimates are less biased than the abundance estimate obtained from the original N-mixture model. The proposed model is then applied to two data sets of avian point counts. The first example demonstrates the closure test on a single-season study of Mallards (Anas platyrhynchos), and the second uses the proposed model to estimate the population dynamics parameters and yearly abundance of American robins (Turdus migratorius) from a multi-year study.},

Amphibians are often characterized by large demographic changes, therefore a better understanding of factors driving these changes could help mitigate their global crisis. We investigated drivers of abundance dynamics of two similar frog species to understand why they met different fates in the same study area. Location Northern Italy. Methods In seven different years between 2004 and 2020, we performed repeated counts of egg masses of two similar frog species, the agile frog (Rana dalmatina) and the Italian agile frog (Rana latastei), in 31 wetlands, and used Bayesian models to estimate the relationships between frog abundance and candidate drivers acting at the scale of (i) site: wetland surface, shading percentage and the presence of the invasive red swamp crayfish (Procambarus clarkii); (ii) landscape: forest cover around wetlands; (iii) climate: yearly precipitation and (iv) spatially structured population (SSP): clutch incidence of the focal species and crayfish incidence in the surrounding landscape. Results The two species showed sharp differences in population size and trends: R. dalmatina was abundant and showed a stable trend throughout the entire study period; R. latastei showed low abundance in the first years and then almost disappeared. The abundance of R. dalmatina was positively related to forest cover, shading, wetland area and precipitation, while negatively related to the occurrence of invasive crayfish at both local and SSP level. R. latastei abundance increased with wetland area and precipitation, while models were not able to detect relationships with other factors. Main conclusions The high sensitivity to drought and demographic stochasticity could have contributed to the quasi-extinction of R. latastei in the study area, highlighting that similar species can meet different fates even under the same environmental conditions.},

The effect of measurement error when applying a visual determination of plant cover is considered. Generally, the estimation of the mean plant cover was well-behaved and unbiased for all the three methods, whereas the estimate of the intra-plot correlation tended to be upward biased and especially so if the plant cover data was collected using the Braun-Blanquet method. It was surprising that the Braun-Blanquet sampling procedure provided mean plant cover estimates that were comparable to the other sampling schemes. This method shows promise in the attempt to use the large amount of historic Braun-Blanquet plant cover data in the investigation of the underlying causes for observed vegetation changes.},

To date, however, it has been underused in studying wild populations of animals and, particularly, in obtaining quantitative abundance estimates.

We interviewed shepherds in southeastern Spain, asking them to estimate the local abundance of the terrestrial tortoise Testudo graeca. We quantified reliability of abundance estimates derived from interviews by comparing them with those obtained from standard field-sampling protocols (distance sampling). We also explored the complementarity of these 2 approaches. LEK provided high-quality and low-cost information about both distribution and abundance of T. graeca. Interviews with shepherds yielded abundance estimates in a much wider range than linear transects, which only detected the species in the upper two-thirds of its abundance range. Abundance estimates from both methodologies showed a close relationship. Analysis of confidence intervals indicated local knowledge could be used to estimate mean local abundances and to detect mean population trends. A cost analysis determined that the information derived from LEK was 100 times cheaper than that obtained through linear-transect surveys. Our results should further the use of LEK as a standard tool for sampling the quantitative abundance of a great variety of taxa, particularly when population densities are low and traditional sampling methods are expensive or difficult to implement.},

  abstract = {The impact of industrial fisheries on marine biodiversity is conspicuous in large pelagic vertebrate's fisheries bycatch. In seabirds, this led to the decline of many populations since the 1980s following the rise of global fishing effort. Bycatch mitigation measures were implemented since the 2000s, but their effects on the concerned seabird populations remain poorly quantified and understood. We studied the effects of bycatch mitigation measures on the demography of the white-chinned petrel, one of the most bycatch impacted seabirds whose populations suffered dramatic declines before the implementation of mitigation measures. To do so we (a) built multi-event capture–recapture models to estimate the demographic parameters of a population from Possession Island (southern Indian Ocean) over 30 years, (b) assessed the effect of climate and fishery covariates on demographic parameters, (c) built a population matrix model to estimate stochastic growth rate according to the management in fisheries bycatch and (d) estimated changes in breeding population density using distance sampling data. The population declined from the 1980s to the mid-2000s, while trawl and longline fisheries occurred with no bycatch mitigation measures. The negative effects of fishery bycatch through additive mortality and of rat predation on breeding success were likely the main drivers of this decline. Both modelled population growth rate and observed breeding densities showed an increase since the mid-2000s. We explained this trend by the improvement in survival probability following implementation of fishery bycatch mitigation measures and in breeding success probability with the local control of the rat population and changes in sea ice conditions on foraging grounds. Synthesis and applications. We provide a holistic approach to assess the effects of management measures by analysing datasets from sampling methods commonly employed in seabird studies. Our conclusions should encourage the eradication of invasive predatory species in seabird breeding areas and the strengthening of bycatch mitigation measures for the vulnerable seabird species, especially in international waters, but also the development of such measures considering the other marine large pelagic species threatened by fisheries bycatch (sharks, rays, turtles and marine mammals) since it could be crucial to avoid populations' extinction.},

To determine if this decline was statewide, an aerial survey was conducted from 1 May to 18 June 2015 to estimate the breeding population using a stratified dual-frame design accounting for imperfect detection of colonies. The strata were based on habitat and known colony densities. The area frame consisted of 10-km x 10-km plots. Stratum samples were searched by air independently by front and rear observers for known and new colonies. The list frame consisted of plots containing known colonies, a sample of which was checked for nesting activity. The dual-frame design combined the strengths of both list- and area-only surveys. Flying directly to known colonies in the list frame was very efficient, and accounting for new colonies in the area frame, allowed unbiased, statistically valid estimation. Estimates were calculated for a Maine statewide total of active Great Blue Heron colonies (n = 243, 90\% credible interval (CI) = 193-352), total nests (n= 2,019, CI = 1,778-2,434), and active nests (n= 1,593, CI = 1,416-1,872).

We conducted a field trial to evaluate observation processes of a terrestrial invasive species (wild pigs- Sus scrofa) from DNA in water bodies. We used a multi-scale occupancy analysis to estimate different levels of observation processes (detection, p): the probability DNA is available per sample (theta), the probability of capturing DNA per extraction (gamma), and the probability of amplification per qPCR run (delta). We selected four sites for each of three water body types and collected 10 samples per water body during two months (September and October 2016) in central Texas. Our methodology can be used to guide sampling adaptively to minimize costs while improving inference of species distributions. Using a removal sampling approach was more efficient than pooling samples and was unbiased. Availability of DNA varied by month, was considerably higher when water pH was near neutral, and was higher in ephemeral streams relative to wildlife guzzlers and ponds. To achieve a cumulative detection probability ¿90\% (including availability, capture, and amplification), future studies should collect 20 water samples per site, conduct at least two extractions per sample, and conduct five qPCR replicates per extraction.

  abstract = {Rear-edge alpine biodiversity is expected to suffer one of the largest ecological impacts due to current and foreseen climate change. For highly mobile and long-living species, climate change might operate through a wide spectrum of demographic and ecological processes influencing population dynamics, which in turn affect local abundance and may eventually lead to population extinctions and drifts in the actual range. Using the community of six passerine species breeding in the alpine zone of the Cantabrian mountains (Northwest Iberian Peninsula), we sought to document the changes in bird abundance across the elevational gradient during the last decade, evaluate the relationship between bird abundance and local climatic conditions (i.e., weather conditions), and discuss the mechanisms by which these conditions might be mediating the observed abundance trends in a global warming context. We estimated bird abundance at the home range level using point count transects and distance sampling during the breeding season, and fitted generalized linear mixed models to describe their temporal trends across the elevational gradient. We used a structural equation modeling approach to estimate the direct, indirect, and total effects of weather and temporal variables, while considering the correlations and causal relationships among them and with the elevational gradient. We found that generalist species had an overall positive trend in their abundance, while alpine specialist had a negative trend at the highest elevations during the study period. This pattern was partly explained by the decrease in wind speed and rising temperature during the study period, which seems to have a stronger effect on abundance of specialist species at the highest elevations in this rear-edge alpine bird community. The effects of weather conditions on the abundance of different bird species in alpine ecosystems seem to be mainly related to the capacity of weather to modulate variations in habitat quality and feeding resources across the elevational gradient. Thus, in a global warming context, it is necessary to gain knowledge of the ecological processes modulating population dynamics of alpine specialists and delineate habitat conservation practices to safeguard alpine biodiversity.},

  abstract = {Many indigenous communities living in the Amazon rely on hunting and fishing to meet the majority of their protein needs. Despite the importance of these practices, few studies from the region have analyzed the socioeconomic drivers of hunting and fishing at the household level. We propose a household production model to assess the effect of key economic parameters on hunting and fishing in small indigenous communities located in the Ecuadorian Amazon, whose principal source of protein is derived from hunting and fishing. The model was validated using empirical data from two communities that reflect different levels of market integration and forest conservation. Demand and supply functions were generated from household data gathered over 19 months. Elasticities were derived to determine the sensitivity of the decision to engage in hunting to exogenous parameters such as off-farm wages, hunting costs, bushmeat price, penalties for the illegal sale of bushmeat, and biological characteristics of the game species. After calibrating the model, we simulated changes in the key economic parameters. The parameter that most directly affected hunting activity in both communities was off-farm wages. Simulating a 10\% wage increase resulted in a 16-20\% reduction in harvested biomass, while a 50\% increase diminished harvested biomass by {$>$} 50\%. Model simulations revealed that bushmeat price and penalties for illegal trade also had important effects on hunter behavior in terms of amount of bushmeat sold, but not in terms of total harvest. As a tool for understanding hunters' economic decision-making, the model provides a basis for developing strategies that promote sustainable hunting and wildlife conservation while protecting indigenous livelihoods.},

  abstract = {False negatives, not detecting things that are actually present, are an important but understudied problem. False negatives are the result of our inability to perfectly detect species, especially those at low density such as endangered species or newly arriving introduced species. They reduce our ability to interpret presence–absence survey data and make sound management decisions (e.g., rapid response). To reduce the probability of false negatives, we need to compare the efficacy and sensitivity of different sampling approaches and quantify an unbiased estimate of the probability of detection. We conducted field experiments in the intertidal zone of New England and New York to test the sensitivity of two sampling approaches (quadrat vs. total area search, TAS), given different target characteristics (mobile vs. sessile). Using logistic regression we built detection curves for each sampling approach that related the sampling intensity and the density of targets to the probability of detection. The TAS approach reduced the probability of false negatives and detected targets faster than the quadrat approach. Mobility of targets increased the time to detection but did not affect detection success. Finally, we interpreted two years of presence–absence data on the distribution of the Asian shore crab (Hemigrapsus sanguineus) in New England and New York, using our probability model for false negatives. The type of experimental approach in this paper can help to reduce false negatives and increase our ability to detect species at low densities by refining sampling approaches, which can guide conservation strategies and management decisions in various areas of ecology such as conservation biology and invasion ecology.},

  abstract = {Effective wildlife management often relies on estimates of animal density, and cue counting is a viable estimation strategy. A key component of density estimation from dung, a form of cue counting, is estimation of the persistence time, t\^ \$\textbackslash hatt\$, of dung piles. However, differences between observers on what constitutes a dung pile may alter subsequent density estimates. Additionally, many researchers studying white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) have substituted for t\^ \$\textbackslash hatt\$ the number of days between the date in which 98\% of deciduous trees shed leaves in autumn and field sampling. To address these 2 concerns, we compared 3 methods for estimating t\^ \$\textbackslash hatt\$ of white-tailed deer pellet groups: (1) a common modelling approach based on observations from a single observer (single-observer method), (2) a method that accommodates interobserver variation on the status of dung during field surveys (interobserver method), and (3) the days elapsed since 98\% of deciduous trees shed autumn leaves (leaf-off method). We then applied these 3 t\^ \$\textbackslash hatt\$ estimates to distance-sampling data on pellet groups from white-tailed deer that we collected along transects during 3 sampling seasons from 2019–2021 in west-central Indiana. We estimated habitat- and year-specific deer densities. Persistence probability of pellet groups varied across habitats and years, positively with age and number of pellets, and negatively with precipitation and temperature. In several instances, we found strong or marginal differences between densities estimated using the leaf-off method and the other 2 methods. The densities using the interobserver and single-observer methods were similar, with the latter being larger by an average of 8.0\% (SE = 1.71). The latter also yielded coefficients of variation (CV) that averaged 16.6\% (SE = 4.8) larger, attributable to interobserver discrepancies in scoring dung persistence. Density estimates from the leaf-off method were 32.6\% (SE = 15.3) and 37.8\% (SE = 13.0) less than the density estimates from the interobserver and single-observer methods, respectively. We encourage future researchers estimating density using multiple observers and dung sampling techniques to incorporate interobserver variation. We advocate that biologists relying on dung-based estimation of density for white-tailed deer abandon the conventional leaf-off method and adopt other modelling approaches.},

  abstract = {Estuarine ecosystems are becoming increasingly altered by the concentration of human populations near the coastline, however a robust indicator of this change is lacking. We developed an index of waterbird community integrity (IWCI) and tested its sensitivity to anthropogenic activities within 28 watersheds and associated subestuaries of Chesapeake Bay, USA. The IWCI was used as a tool to gain insight into how human land use affects estuarine ecosystem integrity. Based on Akaike's information criteria (AIC), a single variable model including percent developed land in estuarine watersheds was thirteen (2002) and twenty-six (2003) times more likely than models including percent agriculture and forest cover to fit the IWCI data. Consequently, we examined how suburban, urban, and total development shaped IWCI scores at three spatial scales: (1) watershed; (2) inverse-distance-weighted (IDW) watershed (land cover near the coastline weighted proportionally greater than that farther away); (3) local (land cover within 500 m of the coastline). Suburban, urban, and total development were all significant predictors of IWCI scores. Relationships were stronger at the IDW and local scales than at the whole watershed scale. Nonparametric changepoint analysis revealed a ¿80\% probability of a threshold in IWCI scores when as little as 3.7\% (2002) and 3.5\% (2003) of the IDW land cover within the watershed was urban. Our results indicate that, of the landscape stressors we examined, development near estuarine coastlines is the primary stressor to estuarine waterbird community integrity; and that estuarine ecosystem integrity may be impaired by even extremely low levels of coastal urbanization.

  abstract = {The landscape within the Chesapeake Bay watershed has been and continues to be impacted by human modifications. Understanding if such anthropogenic disturbances influence organisms that are dependent upon estuarine wetlands remains unclear. We developed an index of marsh bird community integrity (IMBCI) to evaluate marsh bird communities and wetland condition. During the 2002 and 2003 summers, we detected 30 bird species at 219 point count locations distributed among 96 wetlands. lMBCI scores for each wetland were used to determine whether wetland habitat characteristics and urban/suburban development, agriculture, and forest at three different spatial scales (watershed, 1000-m buffer, and 500-m buffer) influenced marsh bird community integrity. We found no relationship between lMBCI scores and wetland habitat characteristics, implying that marsh bird community integrity is not related to any single plant community. Nonparametric changepoint analysis indicated that marsh bird community integrity was significantly reduced when the amount of urban/suburban development within 500 m and 1000 m of the marsh exceeded 14\% and 25\%, respectively. There was no effect of urban/suburban development on lMBCI scores at the watershed scale. The results of our study demonstrate that marsh bird community integrity shows a threshold response to urban/suburban development at local scales. lMBCI scores, combined with the identification of a land-use threshold, can be easy to interpret and may help communicate complex ecological data to natural resource managers and conservation planners.},

Knowledge of this predator through research can assist in effective management decisions which will ensure ecosystem integrity. A study on population estimation and livestock loss by the spotted hyenas was conducted from January 2019 to December 2020 in the Damota community managed forests. Data was collected through distance sampling techniques, and the economic impacts of spotted hyena predation on livestock were quantified using a questionnaire survey with randomly selected households. Twenty-five transects were monitored over a period of two consecutive years. A mean of 113~±~0.51 individuals of spotted hyena was observed per 100~km2. The density of spotted hyena was 1.34~±~0.42 and 0.69~±~0.12 individuals/km2 and 0.55~±~0.97 and 0.75~±~0.14 individuals/km2 in farm and forest during 2019 and 2020, respectively. The mean sex ratio of the adult male to adult female was 0.56:1.00 and 0.74:1.00 during the dry and wet seasons, respectively. Moreover, the mean sex ratio of adult to cub was 1:0.25 and 1:0.29 during the dry and wet seasons, respectively. Respondents indicated a total loss of 377 livestock due to the depredation of spotted hyenas over the past five years. The total estimated economic loss caused by depredation, theft, and diseases was US\$ 47,885. On average, US\$ 9577 per year (US\$ 26 per day) has been lost over the past five years. The average annual depredation per household was 0.98 head of livestock worth US\$ 95.6. Among depredated livestock, 64.8\% of sheep were lost by spotted hyena, followed by donkey (16.4\%). Therefore, livestock management practices, assessment of spotted hyena population, and economic loss are very important for carnivore conservation and scaling up human livelihood development.},

Species richness estimated by rarefaction curves did not differ between methods, except in old-growth understory, where point counts detected fewer species than mist nets. Both methods showed similar patterns of bird diversity and distribution, although point counts revealed more differences between forest layers and forest types. Mist netting contributed to the detection of cryptic or secretive species, especially in the understory, but large-bodied (¿ 200 g) species were detected by point counts alone. Multivariate analysis discerned guilds and species associated with different forest layers and types. Point counts seem to better reflect relative abundance, whereas mist nets may be more sensitive to bird activity (e.g., movements between resources). The simultaneous use of both techniques enhances the description of bird communities, and birds' use of habitats.},

In this study, the regularized spline with tension (RST) interpolation method and ELECTRE TRI MCDA was used to predict forest stand volumes in an area characterized by even-aged stands with heterogeneous structures in Turkey. Sampling data (1050 circular sample plots) were obtained from the National forest inventory. For each species and diameter class, a map of the predicted volume per ha was obtained using the RST method. By repeating the same process for the eight species occurring in the study area, 31 volume maps were produced. The accuracy of these prediction maps was assessed at pixel (20 x 20 m) and area scale (per ha). An accuracy of more than 97\% was achieved at the pixel level, whereas a minimum accuracy of 86\% was achieved for the area-based estimations. In addition, predicted values from the above 31 volume maps were compared with the observed values from management plan reports obtained from the Government Institute responsinble for forest management plans. The comparisons showed an accuracy of predictions of 21, 14, 4, and 2\% for Calabrian pine, Oriental beech, black pine and oak species, respectively. Following interpolation, volume prediction maps were geo-computed, and a volume-based stand map was produced. The 890 different combinations of species composition and diameter classes were classified according to expert knowledge by the use of ELECTRE TRI MCDA, obtaining a final stand type map representing 70 different profile categories based on species mixture rates and diameter classes for the area analyzed.},

In this article we describe a practical and sophisticated data collection and analysis framework for developing a comprehensive wildlife monitoring program that includes multi-species inventory techniques and community-level hierarchical modeling. Compared to monitoring many species individually, the multi-species approach allows for improved estimates of individual species occurrences, including rare species, and an increased understanding of the aggregated response of a community to landscape and habitat heterogeneity. We demonstrate the benefits and practicality of this approach to address challenges associated with monitoring in the context of US state agencies that are legislatively required to monitor and protect species in greatest conservation need. We believe this approach will be useful to regional, national, and international organizations interested in assessing the status of both common and rare species.},

  abstract = {As urban development continues to encroach on the natural and rural landscape, land-use planners struggle to identify high priority conservation areas for protection. Although knowing where urban-sensitive species may be occurring on the landscape would facilitate conservation planning, research efforts are often not sufficiently designed to make quality predictions at unknown locations. Recent advances in occupancy modeling allow for more precise estimates of occupancy by accounting for differences in detectability. We applied these techniques to produce robust estimates of habitat occupancy for a subset of forest breeding birds, a group that has been shown to be sensitive to urbanization, in a rapidly urbanizing yet biological diverse region of New York State. We found that detection probability ranged widely across species, from 0.05 to 0.8. Our models suggest that detection probability declined with increasing forest fragmentation. We also found that the probability of occupancy of forest breeding birds is negatively influenced by increasing perimeter-area ratio of forest fragments and urbanization in the surrounding habitat matrix. We capitalized on our random sampling design to produce spatially explicit models that predict high priority conservation areas across the entire region, where interior-species were most likely to occur. Finally, we use our predictive maps to demonstrate how a strict sampling design coupled with occupancy modeling can be a valuable tool for prioritizing biodiversity conservation in land-use planning.

  abstract = {Accurate estimates of population size and trends are often necessary for wildlife conservation, but imperfect and variable rates of detection can lead to substantially biased counts during surveys. The influence of survey timing relative to timing of breeding on the counts recorded for five shorebird species during transect surveys at East Bay, Nunavut, Canada, from 2000 to 2010 was examined. Transect counts varied widely among species and years, and transect counts were most strongly predicted by the density of nests found during more intensive surveys. However, after accounting for this variation, survey counts were influenced substantially by survey timing. Surveys carried out shortly after the median date of nest initiation (similar to 2 days after) corresponded most closely to the densities of found nests, and if surveys were not within several days of the median date, the discrepancy between the two estimates was large. Although neither nest densities nor transect surveys are believed to be a perfect indication of local population status, these results suggest that the nearly inevitable variation in survey timing could introduce substantial bias into density estimates.},

  abstract = {Several bird-survey methods have been proposed that provide an estimated detection probability so that bird-count statistics can be used to estimate bird abundance. However, some of these estimators adjust counts of birds observed by the probability that a bird is detected and assume that all birds are available to be detected at the time of the survey. We marked male Henslow's Sparrows (Ammodrainus henslowii) and Grasshopper Sparrows (A. savannarum) and monitored their behavior during May-July 2002 and 2003 to estimate the proportion of time they were available for detection. We found that the availability of Henslow's Sparrows declined in late June to ¡ 10\% for 5- or 10-min point counts when a male had to sing and be visible to the observer; but during 20 May-19 June, males were available for detection 39.1\% (SD = 27.3) of the time for 5-min point counts and 43.9\% (SID = 28.9) of the time for 10-min point counts (n = 54). We detected no temporal changes in availability for Grasshopper Sparrows, but estimated availability to be much lower for 5-min point counts (10.3\%, SID = 12.2) than for 10-min point counts (19.2\%, SID = 22.3) when males had to be visible and sing during the sampling period (n = 80). For distance sampling, we estimated the availability of Henslow's Sparrows to be 44.2\% (SD = 29.0) and the availability of Grasshopper Sparrows to be 20.6\% (SID = 23.5). We show how our estimates of availability can be incorporated in the abundance and variance estimators for distance sampling and modify the abundance and variance estimators for the double-observer method. Methods that directly estimate availability from bird counts but also incorporate detection probabilities need further development and will be important for obtaining unbiased estimates of abundance for these species.

Focusing on the insular population on Groote Eylandt, Northern Territory, we present the first study to successfully use live traps, camera traps and radio-tracking to document the ecology of N. aquilo. Searches for signs of the species, camera trapping, pitfall trapping and spotlighting were conducted across the island during 2012-15. These methods detected the species in three of the 32 locations surveyed. Pitfall traps captured 39 individuals over 7917 trap-nights. Females were significantly longer and heavier, and had better body condition, than males. Breeding occurred throughout the year; however, the greatest influx of juveniles into the population occurred early in the dry season in June and July. Nine individuals radio-tracked in woodland habitat utilised discrete home ranges of 0.39-23.95ha. All individuals used open microhabitat proportionally more than was available, and there was a strong preference for eucalypt woodland on sandy substrate rather than for adjacent sandstone woodland or acacia shrubland. Camera trapping was more effective than live trapping at estimating abundance and, with the lower effort required to employ this technique, it is recommended for future sampling of the species. Groote Eylandt possibly contains the last populations of N. aquilo, but even there its abundance and distribution have decreased dramatically in surveys over the last several decades. Therefore, we recommend that the species' conservation status under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 be changed from 'vulnerable' to 'endangered'.

Four separate questions were posed concerning the number of captures for short-term surveys, long-term surveys, arboreal versus terrestrial amphibian surveys, and particular taxonomic group surveys. Over most of the analyses, more individuals and species of amphibians and reptiles were captured using VES than quadrats. In addition, more unique species were recorded with VES. However, particular microhabitats and taxonomic groups were better sampled with quadrats. In long-term surveys, the methods were equivalent with respect to number of individuals and species captured. This study provides quantitative data on the efficacy of the two methods and describes, for the first time, the particular instances in which the different methods are best suited for sampling rain forest herpetofauna.]},

  abstract = {A critical variable in both ecological and conservation field studies is determining how many individuals of a species are present within a defined sampling area. Labor intensive techniques such as capture-mark-recapture and removal sampling may provide estimates of abundance, but there are many logistical constraints to their widespread application. Many studies on terrestrial and aquatic salamanders use counts as an index of abundance, assuming that detection remains constant while sampling. If this constancy is violated, determination of detection probabilities is critical to the accurate estimation of abundance. Recently, a model was developed that provides a statistical approach that allows abundance and detection to be estimated simultaneously from spatially and temporally replicated counts. We adapted this model to estimate these parameters for salamanders sampled over a six year period in area-constrained plots in Great Smoky Mountains National Park. Estimates of salamander abundance varied among years, but annual changes in abundance did not vary uniformly among species. Except for one species, abundance estimates were not correlated with site covariates (elevation, soil and water pH, conductivity, air and water temperature). The uncertainty in the estimates was so large as to make correlations ineffectual in predicting which covariates might influence abundance. Detection probabilities also varied among species and sometimes among years for the six species examined. We found such a high degree of variation in our counts and in estimates of detection among species, sites, and years as to cast doubt upon the appropriateness of using count data to monitor population trends using a small number of area-constrained survey plots. Still, the model provided reasonable estimates of abundance that could make it useful in estimating population size from count surveys.},

Various field measurement systems were compared including 50-m tape, consumer-grade GPS, total-station theodolite and differential GPS. 3. Both total station and differential GPS were able to measure and relocate quadrats accurately to within a few centimetres over distances of hundreds of metres or more. 4. Of over 500 1 x 1 m vegetation monitoring quadrats set out and location re-recorded by differential GPS at sites across UK, only 1\% had positional errors of more than 0 2 m. None of these quadrat locations relied on permanent markers. Differential GPS has the advantage of speed and delivering coordinates in latitude/longitude or local coordinate system directly. 5. Accurately located quadrats can be resurveyed many years in the future just using the original coordinates without worrying about ` permanent' markers that rarely turn out to be truly permanent. If more researchers used these techniques, then there is huge potential for establishing networks of accurate long-term monitoring positions, which could provide information on a wide range of topics, such as vegetation dynamics and environmental change even if these were not the original research objectives.},

To date, estimates of such metrics are equivocal due to design and analysis flaws. Apparent increased estimates of extinction and turnover rates at the edge of range, versus the interior, could be a function of decreased detection probabilities alone, and not of a biological process. We estimated extinction and turnover rates for species at the interiors and edges of their ranges using an approach which incorporates potential heterogeneity in species A detection probabilities. Extinction rates were higher at the edges (0.17 +/- 0.03 [(SE) over cap]) than in the interiors (0.04 +/- 0.01), as was turnover. Without taking the probability of detection into account these differences would be artificially magnified. Knowledge of extinction and turnover rates is essential in furthering our understanding of range dynamics, and in directing conservation efforts. This study further illustrates the practical application of methods proposed recently for estimating extinction rates and other community dynamic parameters.},

  abstract = {Fragmentation of breeding habitat has been hypothesized as a cause of population declines in forest-nesting migratory birds. Negative correlations between the degree of fragmentation and bird density or fecundity at local or regional scales support the fragmentation hypothesis. Yet, in spite of reduced fecundity and densities in fragmented systems, many forest-nesting passerine species have increased in numbers over time. We hypothesized that range-wide population change in species for which habitat fragmentation negatively affects reproductive success should depend on the proportion of the population that actually occupies fragmented landscapes. We predicted that fragmentation-sensitive species (e.g., species that occur in reduced densities in fragmented landscapes) should increase globally in numbers at a greater rate than species that readily occupy fragmented landscapes, because fragmentation-sensitive distributions place a large proportion of the global population in contiguous landscapes that are superior for breeding. We used Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) data and associated landscape metrics, to test this prediction for 10 species of forest-nesting passerines in the United States that experience reproductive dysfunction associated with habitat fragmentation: Ovenbird (Seiurus aurocapillus), Red-eyed Vireo (Vireo olivaceus), Wood Thrush (Hylocichla mustelina), Northern Cardinal (Cardinalis cardinalis), Worm-eating Warbler (Helmitheros vermivorus), Kentucky Warbler (Oporornis formosus), Indigo Bunting (Passerina cyanea), Scarlet Tanager (Piranga olivacea), Acadian Flycatcher (Empidonax virescens), and Hooded Warbler (Wilsonia citrina). Our approach was to: (1) quantify landscape features associated with BBS routes across the eastern United States, (2) classify landscapes around BBS routes as “fragmented” or “contiguous,” (3) estimate the proportion of detected individuals that occurred in fragmented landscapes on a species-by-species basis, and then (4) associate 10-yr trends for each species, with the proportion of breeding individuals occupying fragmented landscapes. Regression analysis indicated a significant, negative relationship between the proportion of the breeding population occupying fragmented landscapes and the population trend from 1970 to 1980. Although this result links habitat fragmentation to population change and provides support for the fragmentation hypothesis, other factors (e.g., land use change, weather, varying life history traits, varying winter survivorship, habitat amount thresholds) could generate similar results. More work is needed to partition the relative influence of these factors on regional bird population dynamics if conservationists are to understand more clearly the effects of fragmentation on the distribution and abundance of species across their ranges.},

  abstract = {Aim During the past decade ecologists have attempted to estimate the parameters of species distribution models by combining locations of species presence observed in opportunistic surveys with spatially referenced covariates of occurrence. Several statistical models have been proposed for the analysis of presence-only data, but these models have largely ignored the effects of imperfect detection and survey bias. In this paper I describe a model-based approach for the analysis of presence-only data that accounts for errors in the detection of individuals and for biased selection of survey locations. Innovation I develop a hierarchical, statistical model that allows presence-only data to be analysed in conjunction with data acquired independently in planned surveys. One component of the model specifies the spatial distribution of individuals within a bounded, geographic region as a realization of a spatial point process. A second component of the model specifies two kinds of observations, the detection of individuals encountered during opportunistic surveys and the detection of individuals encountered during planned surveys. Main conclusions Using mathematical proof and simulation-based comparisons, I demonstrate that biases induced by errors in detection or biased selection of survey locations can be reduced or eliminated by using the hierarchical model to analyse presence-only data in conjunction with counts observed in planned surveys. I show that a relatively small number of high-quality data (from planned surveys) can be used to leverage the information in presence-only observations, which usually have broad spatial coverage but may not be informative of both occurrence and detectability of individuals. Because a variety of sampling protocols can be used in planned surveys, this approach to the analysis of presence-only data is widely applicable. In addition, since the point-process model is formulated at the level of an individual, it can be extended to account for biological interactions between individuals and temporal changes in their spatial distributions.},

During a survey of mammals in Tasmanian coastal woodland and heathland, we compared species richness and indices of abundance obtained from, and survey effort for, baited camera and live traps at the same trap stations on four trapping blocks over 3 nights during two survey periods (March and August-September). More mammal species were detected by camera traps than live traps, partly because of the greater size range of species susceptible to camera traps; yet other rarely live-trapped and some commonly live-trapped species were recorded only on cameras. All but one species, the swamp rat (Rattus lutreolus), were detected at more trap stations by camera traps than by live traps. For those species detected by both techniques, on all four blocks combined, indices of abundance were positively correlated. For the most commonly caught species, the long-nosed potoroo (Potorous tridactylus), there were positive correlations between numbers live trapped and numbers of visits caught on camera at both the spatial scale of the block and of the trap station; however, this relationship was not consistent between survey periods. Higher numbers of detections of P. tridactylus on camera traps allowed finer grained interpretation of results, implying that live trapping reflects the mammal community less efficiently than camera trapping. Camera trapping required similar to 50\% of the person-hours needed for live trapping. Compared with live trapping, camera traps are a more time-efficient method of detecting differences and monitoring changes in abundance of Australian mammals.},

  abstract = {Recovering small populations of threatened species is an important global conservation strategy. Monitoring the anticipated recovery, however, often relies on uncertain abundance indices rather than on rigorous demographic estimates. To counter the severe threat from poaching of wild tigers (Panthera tigris), the Government of Thailand established an intensive patrolling system in 2005 to protect and recover its largest source population in Huai Kha Khaeng Wildlife Sanctuary. Concurrently, we assessed the dynamics of this tiger population over the next 8 years with rigorous photographic capture-recapture methods. From 2006 to 2012, we sampled across 624-1026 km(2) with 137-200 camera traps. Cameras deployed for 21,359 trap days yielded photographic records of 90 distinct individuals. We used closed model Bayesian spatial capture-recapture methods to estimate tiger abundances annually. Abundance estimates were integrated with likelihood-based open model analyses to estimate rates of annual and overall rates of survival, recruitment, and changes in abundance. Estimates of demographic parameters fluctuated widely: annual density ranged from 1.25 to 2.01 tigers/100 km(2), abundance from 35 to 58 tigers, survival from 79.6\% to 95.5\%, and annual recruitment from 0 to 25 tigers. The number of distinct individuals photographed demonstrates the value of photographic capture-recapture methods for assessments of population dynamics in rare and elusive species that are identifiable from natural markings. Possibly because of poaching pressure, overall tiger densities at Huai Kha Khaeng were 82-90\% lower than in ecologically comparable sites in India. However, intensified patrolling after 2006 appeared to reduce poaching and was correlated with marginal improvement in tiger survival and recruitment. Our results suggest that population recovery of low-density tiger populations may be slower than anticipated by current global strategies aimed at doubling the number of wild tigers in a decade.},

  abstract = {Coarse woody debris (CWD) has been identified as an important component in many forest ecosystem processes. Perpendicular distance sampling (PDS) is one of the several efficient new methods that have been proposed for CWD inventory. One drawback of PDS is that the maximum search distance can be very large, especially if CWD diameters are large or the volume factor chosen is small. Here, we propose a modified method, which we call distance-limited PDS, that addresses this limitation. We describe the field procedures, develop new a new estimator, and provide a proof of unbiasedness of that estimator. The new method is compared with line intersect sampling (LIS) and PDS in a field trial in the northeastern United States. The results of the field trial show that this new method requires as little as 1/10 the sampling effort of LIS in order to achieve comparable variance of the estimates.},

This is "cost-effective conservation"-a process that incorporates both monetized benefits and costs. Though controversial, cost-effective conservation is poorly understood and rarely implemented by planners. Drawing from the largest publicly financed conservation programs in the United States, this paper seeks to improve the communication from economists to planners and to overcome resistance to cost-effective conservation. Fifteen practical lessons are distilled, including the negative implications of limiting selection with political constraints, using nonmonetized benefit measures or benefit indices, ignoring development risk, using incomplete cost measures, employing cost measures sequentially, and using benefit indices to capture costs. The paper highlights interrelationships between benefits and complications such as capitalization and intertemporal planning. The paper concludes by identifying the challenges at the research frontier, including incentive problems associated with adverse selection, additionality, and slippage. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Other large herbivores were recorded, even though some species were not easily seen from the air in savannah woodlands. Population estimates for species other than elephant provided indices of abundance that could be used to determine temporal trends in population size. This study tests for significant trends in the abundance of large herbivores in Gonarezhou National Park, assuming that data from aerial sample surveys designed for elephant also provide accurate estimates of real trends in the populations of other herbivores. For each species, the exponential rate of population change was calculated using weighted regression, with the variance of this rate based on the sampling variances of the population estimates. Significant population trends were detected for eight species. Before the 1992 drought, elephant number was held approximately constant by frequent culls, but afterwards, it increased at a mean annual rate of 6.2\% (confidence limits 4.0\% and 8.6\%). Elephants in cow herds increased at 7.3\%, significantly faster than elephants in bull herds (-0.5\%). Buffalo, eland, kudu, nyala, waterbuck, wildebeest and zebra all increased in number, after population declines during the drought.},

Bushmeat markets are found in a large number of human settlements throughout the region and may be used to monitor the state of game species in catchment areas. As depletion of large-bodied species forces hunters to focus on small-bodied species this is likely to be reflected in the mean body mass and species composition of animals sold in that market. In this paper we present data on bushmeat sold in Basankusu market in the Democratic Republic of Congo during a 2-year period (276 sample days). We counted 10,358 carcasses of 33 mammal taxa, emerging from nine well-defined hunting catchment zone; an area of more than 45,000 km(2). For each catchment we assessed human pressures using metrics derived from remote sensing. Human population density correlated with higher species richness of species harvested, as well as with an increase in rarer taxa, and with a tendency for more individuals with higher intrinsic rates of reproduction to be observed. We suggest that simple surrogates of anthropogenic pressure and faunal characteristics in markets can be used as a rapid tool to measure faunal depletion of mammals at a regional scale. Such a system of evidence-based game monitoring would allow identification of both potentially overhunted and of less-disturbed areas for consideration in strategic planning. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Data on population size and rate of decline are required to establish management plans, none of which is available for this species. Here we present the first population size estimate taking into account detection probability and habitat use in the Camargue, southern France. A non-random sample of 33 lakes was used to estimate detection probability from point-counts. Detectability was low, with only 57.5\% of individual broods detected. A random sample of 37 lakes was then used to estimate brood densities. Adjusted densities (taking into account detection probability) were 0.1106 broods per ha of reedbed. Adjusted densities were extrapolated to the entire surface area of reedbeds in the Camargue estimated from a GIS to obtain abundance estimates of the brood population. A minimum estimate of 559 breeding pairs was obtained (95\% confidence interval: 436-855). This estimate is much higher than previous ones (80-100 pairs for the Camargue, 250 pairs for France), and indicates strong underestimation of the population size when not taking into account detectability. Our results suggest that the red-crested pochard may require a reassessment of its conservation status for France and Europe. They further suggest that taking detection probability into account in population estimates of other cryptic species, and notably those of conservation concern, may help clarify their conservation status and may even affect the setting of conservation priorities.},

However, the importance of detectability in habitat selection analyses of rare and cryptic species has received little investigation, although robust methods for estimating detectability have been made recently available. Understanding habitat requirements should be an important management too] for the conservation of the red-crested pochard (Netta rufina), a rare duck species in France and Europe. Three different lake samples (82 lakes in total) were conjointly used in 2000 and 2001 to assess the species habitat requirements, using its presence, density and hatching dates as response variables. Risk of false absence was estimated using the double-observer approach at less than 0.001. A robust-design approach produced estimates of individual brood detectability (0.545, SE = 0.053). Observed red-crested pochard densities were adjusted to time dependent detectabilities, and modelled as a function of habitat variables. Habitat fragmentation and low permanent water levels negatively affected brood densities. Interestingly, these variables were not retained when modelling the unadjusted densities. This analysis showed that investigating temporal variation in brood detectability was a crucial prerequisite in the study of this rare species' habitat requirements. More generally, it strongly suggests that integrating detection probability and its variations in habitat use analyses of cryptic species of conservation concern may be an essential methodological step to reach more valid conclusions on habitat management.

In the 1970s-1980s, its population size was estimated at 57,000-76,000 breeding pairs throughout the Mediterranean Basin, with the largest colony, estimated at 15,000-25,000 pairs, found on Zembra Island, Tunisia. The objectives of our study were to re-estimate the size of the breeding population on Zembra Island, to reassess the global population size of the species, and to analyse the implications of these findings on status and conservation of this species in the Mediterranean. Using distance sampling, we estimated the Zembra breeding population to be 141,780 pairs (95 \% confidence interval 113,720-176,750 pairs). A review of the most recent data on populations of this species throughout the Mediterranean Basin led us to estimate its new global population size at 141,000-223,000 breeding pairs. Using the demographic invariant and potential biological removal approaches, we estimated the maximum number of adults which could be killed annually by all non-natural causes without causing a population decline to be 8800 (range 7700-9700) individuals, of which could be 3700 breeders. Although these results are less alarming in the context of species conservation than previously thought, uncertainties associated with global population size, trends and major threats still raise questions on the future of this species. More generally, we show how a monitoring strategy for a bird supposed to be relatively well known overall can be potentially misleading due to biases in survey design. The reduction of such biases would therefore appear to be an unavoidable prerequisite in cryptic species monitoring before any reliable inference on the conservation status of the species can be drawn.},

The probability that a nest would be detected on any given visit increased by about 0.5\% for each hour of observer experience up to about 70?hours (our maximum). Experience did not affect the probability of observing an adult. The probability of detecting a caracara nest or observing an adult caracara decreased by 2.03.5\% each hour after sunrise that a visit began. If visibility during any portion of a visit was obscured by fog or rain, the probability of detecting a nest decreased by as much as 60\%, and the probability of observing an adult caracara decreased by about 50\%.

Hence, birds were surveyed three years after fire at two large areas that were not subjected to salvage logging, in northern Sweden.

Closed-nest breeders and ground-feeding insectivores were more abundant within the burns than in the surrounding forests, whereas ground- and shrub-breeders were nearly equally abundant in the burns and in unburned forests. Redpoll and Tree Pipit were more common within than outside the burns. Birds feeding on insects in the air and the Redstart were more abundant in burned than in unburned spruce-dominated forest but no such difference was found in pine-dominated forest, suggesting that the short-term effects of wildfire on these birds were stronger in spruce-dominated forest than in pine-dominated forest. A contributing factor might be that crown fire killed most trees in the spruce-dominated burn, but most of the large trees survived the ground fire in the pine-dominated burn.},

Variation between individual divers within volunteer and professional groups also contributed little to total estimated variance between transects compared to residual variation between replicate transects, variation between sites, and variation between regions studied. Sites in 11 MPAs distributed around 5000 km of the Australian coastline had significantly more large ({$>$} 30 cm) fishes and total fish biomass than nearby fished reference sites. For the older MPAs, fishes belonging to the largest size class (≥80 cm) were observed approximately 10 times more often in sanctuary zones than in fished zones, while fishes in the smallest size class (2.5 cm) occurred at densities approximately 4 times higher in fished zones than in sanctuary zones. Results of our empirical field surveys contrast in several respects with outcomes of published meta-analyses. No overall differences in fish densities were evident between sanctuary zones and fished zones. The response of fish species richness to protection varied significantly between different MPAs, while invertebrate density and species richness were both significantly lower in sanctuary zones than in fished zones.},

This was tested against a simulation model of population dynamics, accounting for uncertainties in demography, observation, and implementation. Results showed it to reliably set sustainable quotas despite these uncertainties, providing a robust foundation for the conservation of hunted species.},

Variation in the proportion of birds counted is a known source of error, and for robust inference it has been advocated that counts be converted to estimates of absolute population size. We used simulation to assess nine methods for the conduct and analysis of point counts when the data included distance-related heterogeneity of individual detection probability. Distance from the observer is a ubiquitous source of heterogeneity, because nearby birds are more easily detected than distant ones. Several recent methods (dependent double-observer, time of first detection, time of detection, independent multiple-observer, and repeated counts) do not account for distance-related heterogeneity, at least in their simpler forms. We assessed bias in estimates of population size by simulating counts with fixed radius w over four time intervals (occasions). Detection probability per occasion was modeled as a half-normal function of distance with scale parameter sigma and intercept g(0) = 1.0. Bias varied with sigma/w; values of sigma inferred from published studies were often ¡25 m, which suggests a bias of ¿50\% for a 100-m fixed-radius count. More critically, the bias of adjusted counts sometimes varied more than that of unadjusted counts, and inference from adjusted counts would be less robust. The problem was not solved by using mixture models or including distance as a covariate. Conventional distance sampling performed well in simulations, but its assumptions are difficult to meet in the field. We conclude that no existing method allows effective estimation of population size from point counts. Received 29 November 2007 accepted 1 July 2008.},

  abstract = {We designed and conducted an aerial survey for monitoring trends in duck populations in Florida during January. The state's wetland habitats were represented by a stratified random sample of 150 62.2-km2 units. Statewide estimates for total ducks averaged about 538,000 during 1989-93. Total dabbling duck population estimates averaged 117,000, and total diving duck estimates averaged 399,000. Annual population estimates generally were imprecise (coefficients of variation [CVs] averaged 0.52 and ranged from 0.20 to 0.97), resulting in generally low probability ({$<$}0.70) of detecting annual rates of change of {$<$}0.09 over 10-years (α = 0.10). Serial correlation of population estimates from repeated sampling of survey units potentially inflated Type I error rates above the nominal α = 0.10 level, and were accounted for in our analyses by specifying lower α levels for rejection. We recommend that winter surveys of ducks be spatially replicated to assure CV {$<$}25\% of annual abundance estimates. Replicates should be randomly drawn each year of the survey to avoid serial correlation in the estimates; if precluded by logistical constraints, investigators should estimate, ideally through simulation, the effect of serial correlation on Type I error rates.},

  abstract = {Animal population sizes are often estimated using aerial sample counts by human observers, both for wildlife and livestock. The associated methods of counting remained more or less the same since the 1970s, but suffer from low precision and low accuracy of population estimates. Aerial counts using cost-efficient Unmanned Aerial Vehicles or microlight aircrafts with cameras and an automated animal detection algorithm can potentially improve this precision and accuracy. Therefore, we evaluated the performance of the multi-class convolutional neural network RetinaNet in detecting elephants, giraffes and zebras in aerial images from two Kenyan animal counts. The algorithm detected 95\% of the number of elephants, 91\% of giraffes and 90\% of zebras that were found by four layers of human annotation, of which it correctly detected an extra 2.8\% of elephants, 3.8\% giraffes and 4.0\% zebras that were missed by all humans, while detecting only 1.6 to 5.0 false positives per true positive. Furthermore, the animal detections by the algorithm were less sensitive to the sighting distance than humans were. With such a high recall and precision, we posit it is feasible to replace manual aerial animal count methods (from images and/or directly) by only the manual identification of image bounding boxes selected by the algorithm and then use a correction factor equal to the inverse of the undercounting bias in the calculation of the population estimates. This correction factor causes the standard error of the population estimate to increase slightly compared to a manual method, but this increase can be compensated for when the sampling effort would increase by 23\%. However, an increase in sampling effort of 160\% to 1,050\% can be attained with the same expenses for equipment and personnel using our proposed semi-automatic method compared to a manual method. Therefore, we conclude that our proposed aerial count method will improve the accuracy of population estimates and will decrease the standard error of population estimates by 31\% to 67\%. Most importantly, this animal detection algorithm has the potential to outperform humans in detecting animals from the air when supplied with images taken at a fixed rate.},

We used a combination of simulations and transect survey data collected from blue duikers (Philantomba monticola) in the Lomako wildlife reserve, Democratic Republic of the Congo, to investigate the use of transect-based distance sampling to monitor bushmeat stocks. The comparison of dung piles and direct observations of duikers evidenced that animals avoided both the transects in the absence of observers, and the observers themselves. This type of behavioural response appeared common in a literature survey. It causes a negative bias in the estimates of population densities from the standard distance sampling methodology. This negative bias would lead to over-pessimistic predictions of population viability, especially if the behavioural response is more intense in the locations where the animals are hunted. In turn, this would lead to excessively conservative management recommendations. To correct for the effect of the behavioural response of the animals to either the transects or the observers, we recommend recording both the forward and perpendicular distances to the observers (2D distance sampling), not just the perpendicular distance. We also recommend multiple-observer protocols. As a cautionary note, we also demonstrate a scenario where the intensity of the behavioural response is too high to reliably estimate the abundance of the population. As a perspective, we outline the general principles of a local stakeholder-based program combining distance sampling with less intensive types of ecological indicators to monitor wildlife populations.},

Convenience sampling or camera monitoring may result in biased outcomes, while explicit approaches such as genetic analysis may be impractical due to cost and time. Traditional mark recapture methods are frequently intrusive and pose risk to both animals and handlers that could lead to mortality. These factors highlight the need for a simple, inexpensive, and non-invasive approach to assess species density. One possible technique which addresses these issues is track plate footprinting. We collected raccoon (Procyon lotor) footprints and examined the ability to distinguish individuals by their metacarpal pads from a 225 ha reserve. The probability of identity (PID) for back right feet ranged from 5.72 x 10(-9) - 6.71 x 10(-12) and from 3.34 x 10(-8) - 3.55 x 10(-10) for the back left feet, indicating that it was unlikely any two raccoons shared the same papillae pattern. The minimum number of raccoons known to be alive was estimated to be 12-17 individuals depending upon the foot and scale of resolution used, with estimates from program the Capture ranging from 34-38 raccoons. Our results show that track plate footprint can be used to unambiguously identify individual raccoons, may be useful in mark-recapture studies, and is likely to be applicable to other species with large pads.},

  abstract = {To estimate the spatial intensity (density) of plants and animals, ecologists often sample populations by prespecifing a spatial array of points, then measuring the distance from each point to the k nearest organisms, a so-called k-tree sampling method. A variety of ad hoc methods are available for estimating intensity from k-tree sampling data, but they assume that two distinct points of the array do not share nearest neighbors. However, nearest neighbors are likely to be shared when the population intensity is low, as it is in our application. The purpose of this paper is twofold: (a)~to derive and use for estimation the likelihood function for a k-tree sample under an inhomogeneous Poisson point-process model and (b)~to estimate spatial intensity when nearest neighbors are shared. We derive the likelihood function for an inhomogeneous Poisson point-process with intensity λ(x,y) and propose a likelihood-based, kernel-smoothed estimator \$\textbackslash hat\{\textbackslash lambda\}(x,y)\$. Performance of the method for k=1 is tested on four types of simulated populations: two homogeneous populations with low and high intensity, a population simulated from a bivariate normal distribution of intensity, and a “cliff” population in which the region is divided into high- and low-intensity subregions. The method correctly detected spatial variation in intensity across different subregions of the simulated populations. Application to 1-tree samples of carnivorous pitcher plants populations in four New England peat bogs suggests that the method adequately captures empirical patterns of spatial intensity. However, our method suffers from two evident sources of bias. First, like other kernel smoothers, it underestimates peaks and overestimates valleys. Second, it has positive bias analogous to that of the MLE for the rate parameter of exponential random variables.},

  abstract = {1. Methods papers play a crucial role in advancing applied ecology. Counting organisms, in particular, has a rich history of methods development with many key advances both in field sampling and the treatment of resulting data. 2. Most counts, however, have associated errors due to portions of the population of interest being unavailable for detection (e.g. target population not fully sampled; individuals present but not detectable), detection mistakes (e.g. detectable individuals missed; non-existent individuals recorded), or erroneous counts (e.g. large groups miscounted; individuals misidentified). 3. Developments in field methods focus on reducing biases in the actual counts. Simultaneously, statisticians have developed many methods for improving inference by quantifying and correcting for biases retrospectively. Prominent examples of methods used to account for detection errors include distance sampling and multiple-observer methods. 4. Simulations, in which population characteristics are set by the investigator, provide an efficient means of testing methods. With good estimates of sampling biases, computer Simulations can be used to evaluate how much a given counting problem affects estimates of parameters such as population size and decline, thereby allowing applied ecologists to test the efficacy of sampling designs. Combined with cost estimates for each field method, such models would allow the cost-effectiveness of alternative protocols to be assessed. 5. Synthesis and applications. Major advances are likely to come from research that looks for systematic patterns, across studies, in the effects of different types of bias and assumption violation on the ecological conclusions drawn. Specifically, determining how often, and tinder what circumstances, errors contribute to poor management and policy would greatly enhance future application of ecological knowledge.},

Variable area transect (VAT) sampling had been identified, and optimized relative to effort, in previous Monte Carlo simulated population studies as a low-labor field method that demonstrated superior estimation properties among many PDEs considered. However, natural populations tend to be much more complex and less predictable in spatial distribution than computer generated populations. Therefore, we carried out a Monte Carlo simulation study that used 17 fully enumerated field populations rather than simulated populations. These natural populations represented a variety of population densities and spatial patterns. We focused on assessing the effect of the number of population members searched for along each transect (r), sample size, and transect width on estimation quality. Using relative root mean-squared error and relative bias as criteria, the optimal range for r was 5 to 7 population members encountered from each start point. Sample size was best if n {$>$} 20, but returns in estimation quality diminished by n = 40. Transect width was previously uninvestigated and found to be the most important design factor affecting estimation quality. Field studies should strive for transects as wide as logistically reasonable. Published in 2005 by John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Here we design and evaluate the cost-efficiency of a trap-based surveillance program for early detection of wood borers and bark beetles at risk of establishing in New Zealand. Although costly, a surveillance program could lead to earlier detection of newly established forest pests, thereby increasing the likelihood of successful eradication and reducing control costs and damages from future invasions. We develop a mechanistic bioeconomic model that relates surveillance intensity (i.e., trap density) and invasion size to probabilities of detection and control. It captures the dynamics of invasive species establishment, spread, and damages to urban and plantation forests. We employ the model to design surveillance programs that provide the greatest net present benefits. Our findings suggest that implementing a surveillance trapping program for invasive wood borers and bark beetles would provide positive net benefits under all scenarios considered. The economically optimal trapping strategy calls for a very high investment in surveillance: about 10 000 traps in each year of the 30-year surveillance program, at a present value cost of US\$54 million. This strategy provides a 39\% reduction in costs compared with no surveillance, corresponding to an expected net present benefit of approximately US\$300 million. Although surveillance may provide the greatest net benefits when implemented at relatively high levels, our findings also show that even low levels of surveillance are worthwhile: the economic benefits from surveillance more than offset the rising costs associated with increasing trapping density. Our results also show that the cost-efficiency of surveillance varies across target regions because of differences in pest introduction and damage accumulation rates across locales, with greater surveillance warranted in areas closer to at-risk, high-value resources and in areas that receive more imported goods that serve as an invasion pathway.},

  abstract = {Mid Atlantic coastal salt marshes contain a matrix of vegetation diversified by tidal pools, pannes, and creeks, providing habitats of varying importance to many species of breeding, migrating, and wintering waterbirds. We hypothesized that changes in marsh elevation were not sufficient to keep pace with those of sea level in both vegetated and unvegetated Spartina alterniflora sites at a number of mid lagoon marsh areas along the Atlantic Coast. We also predicted that northern areas would suffer less of a deficit than would southern sites. Beginning in August 1998, we installed surface elevation tables at study sites on Cape Cod, Massachusetts, southern New Jersey, and two locations along Virginia's eastern shore. We compared these elevation changes over the 4-4.5 yr record with the long-term (¿ 50 yr) tidal records for each locale. We also collected data on waterbird use of these sites during all seasons of the year, based on ground surveys and replicated surveys from observation platforms. Three patterns of marsh elevation change were found. At Nauset Marsh, Cape Cod, the Spartina marsh surface tracked the pond surface, both keeping pace with regional sea-level rise rates. In New Jersey, the ponds are becoming deeper while marsh surface elevation remains unchanged from the initial reading. This may result in a submergence of the marsh in the future, assuming sea-level rise continues at current rates. Ponds at both Virginia sites are filling in, while marsh surface elevation rates do not seem to be keeping pace with local sea-level rise. An additional finding at all sites was that subsidence in the vegetated marsh surfaces was less than in unvegetated areas, reflecting the importance of the root mat in stabilizing sediments. The implications to migratory waterbirds are significant. Submergence of much of the lagoonal marsh area in Virginia and New Jersey over the next century could have major negative (i.e., flooding) effects on nesting populations of marsh-dependent seaside sparrows Ammodramus maritimus, saltmarsh sharp-tailed sparrows Ammodramus caudacutus, black rails Laterallus jamaicensis, clapper rails Rallus longirostris, Forster's terns Sterna forsteri, common terns Sterna hirundo, and gull-billed terns Sterna nilotica. Although short-term inundation of many lagoonal marshes may benefit some open-water feeding ducks, geese, and swans during winter, the long-term ecosystem effects may be detrimental, as wildlife resources will be lost or displaced. With the reduction in area of emergent marsh, estuarine secondary productivity and biotic diversity will also be reduced.},

  abstract = {Line transect distance sampling is a popular method for estimating the density of animals across the tropics. The method relies on accurate measurements of the distance between an animal and a transect to model detectability. In dense tropical forests, surveys can become time-consuming, expensive, and dangerous when randomly placed straight line transects cross landscape features such as rivers, swamps, and dense vegetation. As a result, transects often curve as an observer deviates from an ideal, straight line. Here, we examine the practical and statistical impact of these curves. We use distance sampling simulations to assess bias in density estimates based on scenarios corresponding with different methods reliant on distinct field measurements. Methods that measure the nearest distance between the animal and the curving transect produce the most reliable density estimates. Biased estimates were obtained when using methods that ignore curves, measure the distance to an ideal line (as opposed to the curve), or inaccurately calculate the area covered in the survey. Notably, these biased estimates were most severe when observation distances were short, highlighting the importance of accurate measurements in tropical forests characterized by low visibility. Given these results and the importance of reliable density estimates to conservation efforts across the tropics, we propose a method that addresses survey design, simplifies data collection, and alleviates some of the practical field challenges associated with straight line transects. We also developed an R package (CurveTransect) based on this method with functions that ensure accurate measurements and reliable density estimates in tropical forests.},

We compared presence and percent occurrence for each method with the census. The line-intercept (method 3) most closely estimated the census: it was closer for all species occurring on {$>$}1\% of the site, revealed the least variability relative to sample size for dominant species, and accounted for more (20 of 23) plant species on the study site than the other methods.},

  abstract = {Point counts are a common method for sampling avian distribution and abundance. Although methods for estimating detection probabilities are available, many analyses use raw counts and do not correct for detectability. We use a removal model of detection within an N-mixture approach to estimate abundance trends corrected for imperfect detection. We compare the corrected trend estimates to those estimated from raw counts for 16 species using 15 years of monitoring data on three national forests in the western Great Lakes, USA. We also tested the effects of overdispersion by modeling both counts and removal mixtures under three statistical distributions: Poisson, zero-inflated Poisson, and negative binomial. For most species, the removal model produced estimates of detection probability that conformed to expectations. For many species, but not all, estimates of trends were similar regardless of statistical distribution or method of analysis. Within a given combination of likelihood (counts vs. mixtures) and statistical distribution, trends usually differed by both stand type and national forest, with species showing declines in some stand types and increases in others. For three species, Brown Creeper, Yellow-rumped Warbler, and Black-throated Green Warbler, temporal patterns in detectability resulted in substantial differences in estimated trends under the removal mixtures compared to the analysis of raw counts. Overall, we found that the zero-inflated Poisson was the best distribution for our data, although the Poisson or negative binomial performed better for a few species. The similarity in estimated trends that we observed among counts and removal mixtures was probably a result of both experimental design and sampling effort. First, the study was originally designed to avoid confounding observer effects with habitats or time. Second, our time series is relatively long and our sample sizes within years are large.},

  abstract = {Carcass searches are a common method for studying the risk of anthropogenic hazards to wildlife, including nontarget poisoning and collisions with anthropogenic structures. Typically, numbers of carcasses found must be corrected for scavenging rates and imperfect detection. Parameters for these processes (scavenging and detection) are often estimated using carcass distribution trials in which researchers place carcasses in the field at known times and locations. In this manuscript I develop a variety of estimators based on multi-event or hidden Markov models for use under different experimental conditions. I apply the estimators to two case studies of avian mortality, one from pesticide exposure and another at wind turbines. The proposed framework for mortality estimation points to a unified framework for estimation of scavenging rates and searcher efficiency in a single trial and also allows estimation based only on accidental kills, obviating the need for carcass distribution trials. Results of the case studies show wide variation in the performance of different estimators, but even wider confidence intervals around estimates of the numbers of animals killed, which are the direct result of small sample size in the carcass distribution trials employed. These results also highlight the importance of a well-formed hypothesis about the temporal nature of mortality at the focal hazard under study.},

Based on this review, we develop a design for the Stability of Altered Forest Ecosystems (SAFE) Project, a new forest fragmentation experiment to be located in the lowland tropical forests of Borneo (Sabah, Malaysia). The SAFE Project represents an advance on existing experiments in that it: (i) allows discrimination of the effects of landscape-level forest cover from patch-level processes; (ii) is designed to facilitate the unification of a wide range of data types on ecological patterns and processes that operate over a wide range of spatial scales; (iii) has greater replication than existing experiments; (iv) incorporates an experimental manipulation of riparian corridors; and (v) embeds the experimentally fragmented landscape within a wider gradient of land-use intensity than do existing projects. The SAFE Project represents an opportunity for ecologists across disciplines to participate in a large initiative designed to generate a broad understanding of the ecological impacts of tropical forest modification.},

  abstract = {We used data on number of carcasses of wildlife species sold in 79 bushmeat markets in a region of Nigeria and Cameroon to assess whether species composition of a market could be explained by anthropogenic pressures and environmental variables around each market. More than 45 mammal species from 9 orders were traded across all markets; mostly ungulates and rodents. For each market, we determined median body mass, species diversity (game diversity), and taxa that were principal contributors to the total number of carcasses for sale (game dominance). Human population density in surrounding areas was significantly and negatively related to the percentage ungulates and primates sold in markets and significantly and positively related to the proportion of rodents. The proportion of carnivores sold was higher in markets with high human population densities. Proportion of small-bodied mammals ({$<$}1 kg) sold in markets increased as human population density increased, but proportion of large-bodied mammals ({$>$}10 kg) decreased as human population density increased. We calculated an index of game depletion (GDI) for each market from the sum of the total number of carcasses traded per annum and species, weighted by the intrinsic rate of natural increase (r(max)) of each species, divided by individuals traded in a market. The GDI of a market increased as the proportion of fast-reproducing species (highest r(max)) increased and as the representation of species with lowest r(max) (slow-reproducing) decreased. The best explanatory factor for a market's GDI was anthropogenic pressureroad density, human settlements with {$>$}3000 inhabitants, and nonforest vegetation. High and low GDI were significantly differentiated by human density and human settlements with {$>$}3000 inhabitants. Our results provided empirical evidence that human activity is correlated with more depleted bushmeat faunas and can be used as a proxy to determine areas in need of conservation action. Correlaciones entre los Mercados de Carne de Animales Silvestres y la Disminucion de la Vida Silvestre Usamos datos numericos de carcasas de especies de vida silvestre vendidas en 79 mercados de carne de animales silvestres, en una region de Nigeria y Camerun, para evaluar si la composicion de especies de un mercado puede explicarse por medio de presiones antropogenicas y variables ambientales alrededor de cada mercado. Mas de 45 especies de mamiferos de nueve ordenes fueron vendidas en todos los mercados, la mayoria ungulados y roedores. Para cada mercado determinamos el promedio de masa corporal, diversidad de especies (diversidad de presa) y taxones que principalmente contribuyeron al numero total de carcasas en venta (dominancia de presa). La densidad de poblacion humana en las areas colindantes estuvo negativa y significativamente relacionada con el porcentaje de ungulados y primates vendidos en los mercados y positiva y significativamente relacionada con la proporcion de roedores. La proporcion de carnivoros vendidos fue mas alta en los mercados con altas densidades de poblacion humana. La proporcion de mamiferos de pequeno tamano ({$<$} 1kg) vendidos en los mercados se incremento conforme se incrementaba la densidad de poblacion humana, pero la proporcion de mamiferos de gran tamano ({$>$} 10kg) disminuyo conforme aumento la densidad de poblacion humana. Calculamos un indice de disminucion de presas (IDP) para cada mercado, a partir de la suma del numero total de carcasas vendidas por ano y especie, sopesado por la tasa intrinseca de incremento natural (r(max)) de cada especie, dividida por el numero de individuos vendidos en un mercado. El IDP de un mercado se incremento conforme lo hizo la proporcion de especies de rapida reproduccion (r(max) mas alta) y conforme disminuyo la representacion de especies con la r(max) mas baja (de baja reproduccion). El mejor factor explicativo para el IDP de un mercado fue la presion antropogenica - densidad de carreteras, asentamientos humanos con mas de 3000 habitantes y vegetacion no boscosa. Los IDP altos y bajos fueron significativamente diferenciados por la densidad humana y los asentamientos humanos con mas de 3000 habitantes. Nuestros resultados proporcionaron evidencia empirica de que la actividad humana esta correlacionada con la disminucion de especies cazadas y puede usarse como indicador para determinar areas que necesiten acciones de conservacion.

  abstract = {Background The principle that a single large habitat patch should hold more species than several small patches totalling the same area (SL {$>$} SS) is used by conservation agencies to favour protection of large, contiguous areas. Previous reviews of empirical studies have found the opposite, SS {$>$} SL, creating the single large or several small (SLOSS) debate. Aims Review the empirical and theoretical SLOSS literature; identify potential mechanisms underlying the SS {$>$} SL pattern; evaluate these where possible. Location Global. Time period 1976–2018. Major taxa Plants, invertebrates, vertebrates. Methods Literature review. Results Like previous reviews, I found that SS {$>$} SL dominates empirical findings. This pattern remained, although it was somewhat weakened, in studies where sampling intensity was proportional to patch size. I found six classes of theory, and conducted five preliminary evaluations of theory. None of the predictions was supported. The SS {$>$} SL pattern held for specialist species groups, suggesting it does not result from incursion by generalists into small patches. I found no evidence for the prediction that the reverse pattern (SL {$>$} SS) becomes more common over time since patch creation, through gradual species losses from SS. I found no difference between results for natural and anthropogenic patches. There was also no evidence for predictions that SL {$>$} SS is more common when the matrix is more hostile, or for stable than ephemeral patches. Main conclusions Most empirical comparisons find SS {$>$} SL. While there are several potential causes, more empirical work is needed to identify those at play. Meanwhile, conservation practitioners should understand that there is no ecological evidence supporting a general principle to preserve large, contiguous habitat areas rather than multiple small areas of the same total size.},

Published data from 36 sites in seven countries were used. A total of 71 mammals from 8 orders and 22 families were hunted. Significant variation was found in number of species exploited, but ungulates constituted 73.2\% of all hunted animals. Rodents and primates contributed 12.2\% and 12.0\%, respectively. Large-bodied species (15.0–99.9 kg) represented over half (54.4\%) of the total hunted biomass. Most species were snared, and were generally medium-sized, fast, terrestrial, frugivore–herbivores. By species, we showed using meta-analysis, that abundance was the main predictor of harvest level. But, the relationship between hunter presence (calculated as average hunter numbers operating per 100 days) and hunter ease (an index of catchability of the hunted fauna) and site harvest levels was shown to be significant only for hunter ease. Site harvest rates were higher in areas with more hunter presence. Overall, an average of 2000 carcasses (16,000 kg in weight) per site was extracted in a year. Per hunter, this amounted to 200 carcasses (1000 kg) extracted. Such amounts fall within reported unsustainable harvest levels of the mammalian fauna in African forests.},

  abstract = {Simple Summary Estimating the abundance of populations is a key task of zoologists, but animal species often are difficult to detect- As a consequence, obtaining estimates of abundance can be problematic. For many frogs, the count of the number of egg clutches is the standard approach. How many egg clutches are missed during these counts? What are the consequences of missing some egg clutches on the estimates of population decline? First, we used the double-observer approach to estimate the detection probability of the clutches of two frog species (the agile frogs Rana latastei and R. dalmatina) and found that, for both species, clutches are very easy to detect. Subsequently, by using simulations, we showed that if the detection probability is very high, such as in this case, assessing if populations are stable or declining is straightforward. The situation is much trickier for species that are difficult to detect. Information on the detection probability of a species can be used to optimize their monitoring strategies. Most animal species are detected imperfectly and overlooking individuals can result in a biased inference of the abundance patterns and underlying processes. Several techniques can incorporate the imperfect detection process for a more accurate estimation of abundance, but most of them require repeated surveys, i.e., more sampling effort compared to single counts. In this study, we used the dependent double-observer approach to estimate the detection probability of the egg clutches of two brown frog species, Rana dalmatina and R. latastei. We then simulated the data of a declining population at different levels of detection probability in order to assess under which conditions the double counts provided better estimates of population trends compared to naive egg counts, given the detectability of frog clutches. Both species showed a very high detection probability, with average values of 93\% for Rana dalmatina and 97\% for R. latastei. Simulations showed that not considering imperfect detection reduces the power of detecting population trends if detection probability is low. However, at high detection probability (¿80\%), ignoring the imperfect detection does not bias the estimates of population trends. This suggests that, for species laying large and easily identifiable egg clutches, a single count can provide useful estimates if surveys are correctly timed.},

When choosing camera models, practitioners often consider camera trigger speed to be one of the most important factors to maximise species detections. However, factors such as detection zone will also influence detection probability. As part of a rabbit eradication program, we performed a pilot study to compare rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) detections using the Reconyx PC900 (faster trigger speed, narrower detection zone) and the Ltl Acorn Ltl-5310A (slower trigger speed, wider detection zone). Contrary to our predictions, the slower-trigger-speed cameras detected rabbits more than twice as often as the faster-trigger-speed cameras, suggesting that the wider detection zone more than compensated for the relatively slower trigger time. We recommend context-specific field trials to ensure cameras are appropriate for the required purpose. Missed detections could lead to incorrect inferences and potentially misdirected management actions.},

We used autumn satellite tracks of 57 adult Ospreys (Pandion haliaetus) captured on the breeding range in North America between 1995 and 2000 to assess the extent to which migration monitoring sampled their populations. We used (1) 3-km-wide and 6-km-wide linear trajectories (migration paths) that connected locations with straight lines and (2) utilization distributions derived from Brownian bridge movement models to estimate the proportions of Ospreys likely to have been detected by watch-sites and watch-sites likely to have detected tagged birds, and to describe the geography of southward migration between North America and South America. The migration path method estimated continental detection rates of 12-23\%, with regional maxima of 21-36\% in eastern North America. This analysis indicated that 8-20\% of all watch-sites could have detected ¿= 1 of the satellite-tracked Ospreys. The Brownian bridge method estimated that 95\% of the utilization distributions of migrating Ospreys in North America intersected ¿= 1 watch-site and that 89\% of all watch-sites intersected ¿= 1 utilization distribution. Using this method, regional probabilities of detection (mean +/- SD) for individuals were estimated to be 33.8 +/- 28.8\% in eastern, 5.8 +/- 6.6\% in midwestern, and 4.7 +/- 4.9\% in northwestern (Pacific coast) North America. Migrating Ospreys appear to concentrate along well-defined, narrow fronts and to use land bridges where available, rather than travel along broad fronts and engage in large water crossings during autumn migration.

  abstract = {We describe a method for estimating the total number of shorebirds that use a migration stopover site during spring and fall migration. We combined weekly shorebird counts with parameter estimates for detection probability, sampled proportion, and length of stay on the Squaw Creek National Wildlife Refuge. Double sampling was used to determine detection probability and estimated values varied among wetland units from a low of 0.07 to a high of 0.82. The sampled proportion of most wetland units was 100\% but was lower in some of the larger units. Length of stay (measured for Pectoral [Calidris melanotos] and Least Sandpipers [C. minutilla] combined) averaged 10.0 days in spring and 3.7 days in fall. Spring shorebird numbers were approximately five times greater than fall numbers on the Refuge. Annual shorebird numbers varied among years from an estimated low in 2003 of 15 734 to a high in 2002 of 69 570. Peak daily counts during study years averaged only 12\% of estimated spring totals and 4\% of fall totals. An estimate of shorebird numbers based on summing weekly counts, not corrected for detection probability or sampled proportion, would have been only 21\% (spring) to 31\% (fall) of the total number of birds. These results reveal that peak counts and nonadjusted counts can significantly underestimate the number of shorebirds that use migration stopover sites in the midcontinent of North America.},

  abstract = {Long-term wildlife monitoring involves collecting time series data, often using the same observers over multiple years. Aging-related changes to these observers may be an important, under-recognized source of error that can bias management decisions. In this study, we used data from two large, independent bird surveys, the Atlas of the Breeding Birds of Ontario (”OBBA”) and the North American Breeding Bird Survey (”BBS”), to test for age-related observer effects in long-term time series of avian presence and abundance. We then considered the effect of such aging phenomena on current population trend estimates. We found significantly fewer detections among older versus younger observers for 13 of 43 OBBA species, and declines in detection as an observer ages for 4 of 6 vocalization groups comprising 59 of 64 BBS species. Consistent with hearing loss influencing this pattern, we also found evidence for increasingly severe detection declines with increasing call frequency among nine high-pitched bird species (OBBA); however, there were also detection declines at other frequencies, suggesting important additional effects of aging, independent of hearing loss. We lastly found subtle, significant relationships between some species' published population trend estimates and (1) their corresponding vocalization frequency (n ¿= 22 species) and (2) their estimated declines in detectability among older observers (n = 9 high-frequency, monotone species), suggesting that observer aging can negatively bias long-term monitoring data for some species in part through hearing loss effects. We recommend that survey designers and modelers account for observer age where possible.},

This assumption is based on the idea that landscapes with a more diverse fire history provide a greater array of post-fire habitats, leading to a greater number of species within the landscape. We assessed the hypothesis that pyrodiversity begets biodiversity by enhancing community differentiation (b diversity), resulting in increased landscape-scale richness (c-diversity).

  abstract = {Use of point-count surveys is a popular method for collecting data on abundance and distribution of birds. However, analyses of such data often ignore potential differences in detection probability. We adapted a removal model to directly estimate detection probability during point-count surveys. The model assumes that singing frequency is a major factor influencing probability of detection when birds are surveyed using point counts. This may be appropriate for surveys in which most detections are by sound. The model requires counts to be divided into several time intervals. Point counts are often conducted for 10 min, where the number of birds recorded is divided into those first observed in the first 3 min, the subsequent 2 min, and the last 5 min. We developed a maximum-likelihood estimator for the detectability of birds recorded during counts divided into those intervals. This technique can easily be adapted to point counts divided into intervals of any length. We applied this method to unlimited-radius counts conducted in Great Smoky Mountains National Park. We used model selection criteria to identify whether detection probabilities varied among species, throughout the morning, throughout the season, and among different observers. We found differences in detection probability among species. Species that sing frequently such as Winter Wren (Troglodytes troglodytes) and Acadian Flycatcher (Empidonax virescens) had high detection probabilities (similar to90\%) and species that call infrequently such as Pileated Woodpecker (Dryocopus pileatus) had low detection probability (36\%). We also found detection probabilities varied with the time of day for some species (e.g. thrushes) and between observers for other species. We used the same approach to estimate detection probability and density for a subset of the observations with limited-radius point counts. Received 23 February 2000, accepted 9 October 2001.},

By sharing biological parameters, integrated models improve the accuracy and precision of estimates compared to separate analyses of individual data sets. We developed an integrated point process model to combine presence-only and distance sampling data for estimation of spatially explicit abundance patterns. Simulations across a range of parameter values demonstrate that our model can recover estimates of biological covariates, but parameter accuracy and precision varied with the quantity of each data type. We applied our model to a case study of black-backed jackals in the Masai Mara National Reserve, Kenya, to examine effects of spatially varying covariates on jackal abundance patterns. The model revealed that jackals were positively affected by anthropogenic disturbance on the landscape, with highest abundance estimated along the Reserve border near human activity. We found minimal effects of landscape cover, lion density, and distance to water source, suggesting that human use of the Reserve may be the biggest driver of jackal abundance patterns. Our integrated model expands the scope of ecological inference by taking advantage of widely available presence-only data, while simultaneously leveraging richer, but typically limited, distance sampling data.},

  abstract = {Reducing uncertainty in forest carbon estimates at local and regional scales has become increasingly important due to the centrality of the terrestrial carbon cycle in issues of climate change. Despite relatively limited geographical extent, temperate forests are among the most carbon dense forests in the world. Estimates of carbon in key understorey life forms and belowground components of these forests have often been excluded from previous studies in south-eastern Australia. We estimated above- and belowground carbon stocks (including soil to 0.3 m depth) in stands of cool temperate rainforest (‘rainforest’), wet sclerophyll forest (‘eucalypt forest’), and mixed rainforest–wet sclerophyll stands (‘ecotone forest’) across a wide range of environmental conditions and forest structures. We examined relationships among component carbon stocks and a range of environmental variables (edaphic, climatic, spatial) and present the first allometric equations and carbon stock estimates for south-eastern Australian tree ferns. Component carbon stocks were within the range of published values for these stand types. Using multivariate analyses of all component stocks, we detected significantly more carbon in total above- and belowground components in ecotone (697 Mg haÀ1, 95\% confidence interval 575–819 Mg haÀ1) and eucalypt forests (689 Mg haÀ1, 605–773 Mg haÀ1) than rainforest (550 Mg haÀ1, 453–647 Mg haÀ1). However, we found no significant differences among the stand types in the proportional distribution of carbon among components despite significant differences in structural composition as indicated by size class distributions of the main genera. Of total carbon, \$48\% was stored in trees ({$>$}2 cm over-bark diameter), and \$72\% of tree carbon was stored in the largest 10\% of all trees. The most important environmental variables associated with carbon stocks irrespective of stand type were edaphic variables, most commonly total and available soil nitrogen. Tree fern carbon was the only component stock more strongly associated with climatic and spatial than edaphic variables. Our findings indicate that disturbance mediated changes in stand dynamics could significantly alter total carbon stocks, particularly if more frequent fires limit tree recruitment and increase large tree mortality. Monitoring of these forests for carbon could place greater emphasis on key structural elements associated with the largest proportion of total carbon, the largest trees. By reducing uncertainties associated with estimates of carbon in key stocks, we can better understand potential future changes to the carbon cycle from altered stand dynamics under climate change.},

In this study we demonstrate forest classification approaches using airborne lidar data as inputs to random forest and linear unmixing classification algorithms. Our results demonstrated that both random forest and linear unmixing models identified a distribution of rainforest and eucalypt stands that was comparable to existing ecological vegetation class (EVC) maps based primarily on manual interpretation of high resolution aerial imagery. Rainforest stands were also identified in the region that have not previously been identified in the EVC maps. The transition between stand types was better characterised by the random forest modelling approach. In contrast, the linear unmixing model placed greater emphasis on field plots selected as endmembers which may not have captured the variability in stand structure within a single stand type. The random forest model had the highest overall accuracy (84\%) and Cohen’s kappa coefficient (0.62). However, the classification accuracy was only marginally better than linear unmixing. The random forest model was applied to a region in the Central Highlands of south-eastern Australia to produce maps of stand type probability, including areas of transition (the ‘ecotone’) between rainforest and eucalypt forest. The resulting map provided a detailed delineation of forest classes, which specifically recognised the coalescing of stand types at the landscape scale. This represents a key step towards mapping the structural and spatial complexity of these ecosystems, which is important for both their management and conservation.},

However, the reliability of methods for estimating rabbit abundance, particularly when at low numbers, is not well understood. Further, better standardization of these methodologies would allow abundance estimates to be more reliably compared between areas and periods. Consequently, we compared several frequently used methods of estimating rabbit abundance and assessed their advantages and disadvantages. During the summers of 2008 and 2009, in 11 localities of central-southern Spain we undertook (a) driving transect counts of rabbits, either at dusk or at night, (b) linear transects on foot recording rabbit signs, (c) cleared-plot pellet counts at permanent plots, and (d) standing crop counts, both with and without habitat stratification. Density estimated at night from driving transects using the Distance Sampling method (the reference method against which all other indices were compared) varied from 0 to 2.69 rabbits ha(-1). Most pellet-count indices were significantly related to the reference method. In particular, cleared-plot pellet counts in permanent plots corrected for pellet persistence showed the best correlation with the reference method. In contrast, latrine counts were not related to the reference method index, and we recommend against their use. A standard methodology based on cleared-plot pellets counts could be used to monitor rabbit abundance on a large scale.},

  abstract = {Many applied problems in ecology and conservation require prediction, and population models are important tools for that purpose. Formerly, the majority of predictive population models were based on matrix models. As the limitations of classical matrix models have become clearer, the use of individual-based models has increased. These models use behavioral rules imposed at the level of the individual to establish the emergent consequences of those rules at the population level. Individual behaviors in such models use an array of different rule types, from empirically derived probabilities to long-term fitness considerations. There has been surprisingly little discussion of the strengths and weaknesses of these different rule types. Here, we consider different strategies for modeling individual behaviors, together with some problems associated with individual-based models. We propose a novel approach based on modeling optimal annual routines. Annual routines allow individual behaviors to be predicted over a whole annual cycle within the context of long-term fitness considerations. Temporal trade-offs between different behaviors are automatically included in annual routine models, overcoming some of the primary limitations of other individual-based models. Furthermore, as well as population predictions, individual behaviors and indices of condition are emergent features of annual routine models. We show that these can be more sensitive to environmental change than population size, offering alternative, repeatable metrics for monitoring population status. Annual routine models provide no panacea for the problems of data limitations in predictive population modeling. However, as a result of their ability to deal with life-history trade-offs, as well as their potential for relatively rapid and accurate validation and parameterization, we suggest that annual routine models have strong potential for predictive population modeling in applied conservation settings.},

  abstract = {In spatial surveys for estimating the density of objects in a survey region, systematic designs will generally yield lower variance than random designs. However, estimating the systematic variance is well known to be a difficult problem. Existing methods tend to overestimate the variance, so although the variance is genuinely reduced, it is over-reported, and the gain from the more efficient design is lost. The current approaches to estimating a systematic variance for spatial surveys are to approximate the systematic design by a random design, or approximate it by a stratified design. Previous work has shown that approximation by a random design can perform very poorly, while approximation by a stratified design is an improvement but can still be severely biased in some situations. We develop a new estimator based on modeling the encounter process over space. The new “striplet” estimator has negligible bias and excellent precision in a wide range of simulation scenarios, including strip-sampling, distance-sampling, and quadrat-sampling surveys, and including populations that are highly trended or have strong aggregation of objects. We apply the new estimator to survey data for the spotted hyena (Crocuta crocuta) in the Serengeti National Park, Tanzania, and find that the reported coefficient of variation for estimated density is 20\% using approximation by a random design, 17\% using approximation by a stratified design, and 11\% using the new striplet estimator. This large reduction in reported variance is verified by simulation.},

During the last decade, technical developments allowed to take into account these statistical issues in a growing number of studies. Nevertheless, the use of these approaches may be more widespread, particularly for the analysis of spatially-autocorrelated data. It is widely recognized that amphibian decline is often determined by the joint effect of multiple processes. However, the majority of recent studies focused on one potential threat only, and research rarely integrated analyses on terrestrial and aquatic environments. Finally, tropical areas remain insufficiently represented in amphibian conservation studies, despite they harbour most of biodiversity and threatened species. A better incorporation of technical advancements, and an expansion of themes and geographical scope can improve our understanding of processes determining the amphibian biodiversity crisis, and to improve the linkages between conservation research and practical actions.},

It is unclear to what extent HIW (e.g., ponds, reservoirs, impoundments, aquaculture sites, and flooded agricultural fields) provide equivalent habitat for wading birds compared with the natural wetlands they are replacing or augmenting. We compared selection of HIW with natural wetlands by Great Egrets (Ardea alba) in 2 regions containing high proportions of wetlands (73\% Louisiana [LA], 39\% South Carolina [SC]) and similar proportions of HIW (4.3\% LA, 4.5\% SC). Great Egrets in LA (n = 11) and SC (n = 19) were tracked using satellite transmitters for up to 1 year to assess selection of home ranges and foraging sites. We also compared selection of flooded agricultural fields vs. natural wetlands as foraging sites from aerial surveys of untagged egrets in LA. In SC, tagged birds showed stronger selection for HIW than natural wetlands as foraging sites, driven by use of small man-made ponds (39.9\% of foraging observations), but home ranges did not contain a disproportionate area of ponds. In LA, tagged birds showed no overall selection of HIW at either scale, but unmarked egrets showed strong selection for crayfish aquaculture ponds, especially during drawdown. Rice fields provided only a short window of opportunity for foraging Great Egrets and were not selected over nearby natural sites. Despite widespread availability of HIW in the southeastern USA, our results show that natural wetlands continue to provide the majority of foraging habitat for Great Egrets; however, some HIW types (aquaculture and small ponds) may be strongly selected.},

  abstract = {Background: Wildlife populations are difficult to monitor directly because of costs and logistical challenges associated with collecting informative abundance data from live animals. By contrast, data on harvested individuals (e. g., age and sex) are often readily available. Increasingly, integrated population models are used for natural resource management because they synthesize various relevant data into a single analysis. Methodology/Principal Findings: We investigated the performance of integrated population models applied to black bears (Ursus americanus) in Minnesota, USA. Models were constructed using sex-specific age-at-harvest matrices (1980-2008), data on hunting effort and natural food supplies (which affects hunting success), and statewide mark-recapture estimates of abundance (1991, 1997, 2002). We compared this approach to Downing reconstruction, a commonly used population monitoring method that utilizes only age-at-harvest data. We first conducted a large-scale simulation study, in which our integrated models provided more accurate estimates of population trends than did Downing reconstruction. Estimates of trends were robust to various forms of model misspecification, including incorrectly specified cub and yearling survival parameters, age-related reporting biases in harvest data, and unmodeled temporal variability in survival and harvest rates. When applied to actual data on Minnesota black bears, the model predicted that harvest rates were negatively correlated with food availability and positively correlated with hunting effort, consistent with independent telemetry data. With no direct data on fertility, the model also correctly predicted 2-point cycles in cub production. Model-derived estimates of abundance for the most recent years provided a reasonable match to an empirical population estimate obtained after modeling efforts were completed. Conclusions/Significance: Integrated population modeling provided a reasonable framework for synthesizing age-at-harvest data, periodic large-scale abundance estimates, and measured covariates thought to affect harvest rates of black bears in Minnesota. Collection and analysis of these data appear to form the basis of a robust and viable population monitoring program.},

  abstract = {There is ongoing debate in ecology about the value of the increasing complexity of analytical methods, especially as it relates to models that correct occupancy or abundance estimates for imperfect detection. While both arguments for and against increasing complexity have merit, there is a need for greater clarity on how to determine what level of complexity is necessary. We present a general approach and case study for comparing alternative detection methods that vary in their complexity. Our approach puts emphasis on the logistical costs of methods, which are often overlooked in the debate about method complexity, and on developing models that address common sources of error in ecological data sets while avoiding unwarranted complexity. We used point counts of saltmarsh sparrows (Ammodramus caudacutus) to compare estimates of abundance from three alternative protocols that vary by logistical costs: single observer, multiple observers and multiple visits. We also compared results from counts to those from captures and nest searches from the same populations to provide broader context for the evaluation of point count methods. We found that parameter estimates derived from alternative count protocols were similar and that predictions of point-level abundance were highly correlated (r=096). We found lower correlation between pairwise comparisons of abundance estimated from point count data, the number of individuals captured and the number of nests (all comparisons r=050 or less). Choosing point counts over alternative measures of abundance may have a greater effect on inferences than choosing among specific count protocols. For saltmarsh sparrows, there is likely little added benefit to adopting count protocols that require additional logistical costs. Determining the frequency of cases like this has broad implications for the appropriate design of studies that rely on estimates of abundance, especially when resources are limited. The general approach we present can be used to assess whether general rules of thumb can be developed to benefit people charged with implementing field studies and allocating limited resources.},

We derive optimal alpha-levels for decision-making by minimizing a cost function that specifies the overall cost of monitoring and management. When managing an economically valuable koala population, it shows that a decision based on alpha = 0.05 carries an expected cost over \$5 million greater than the optimal decision. For a species of such value, there is never any benefit in guarding against the spurious detection of declines and therefore management should proceed directly to recovery action. This result holds in most circumstances where the species' value substantially exceeds its recovery costs. For species of lower economic value, we show that the conventional alpha-level of 0.05 rarely approximates the optimal decision-making threshold. This analysis supports calls for reversing the statistical `burden of proof' in environmental decision-making when the cost of Type II errors is relatively high.},

  abstract = {Efforts to design monitoring regimes capable of detecting population trends can be thwarted by observational and economic constraints inherent to most biological surveys. Ensuring that limited resources are allocated efficiently requires evaluation of statistical power for alternative survey designs. We simulated the process of data collection on a landscape, where we initiated declines over 3 sample periods in species of varying prevalence and detectability. Changing occupancy levels were estimated using a technique that accounted for effects of false-negative errors on survey data. Declines were identified within a frequentist statistical framework, but the significance level was set at an optimal level rather than adhering to an arbitrary conventional threshold. By varying the number of sites sampled and repeat visits made, we show how managers can design an optimal monitoring regime that maximizes statistical power within fixed budget constraints. Results show that 2 to 3 visits/site are generally sufficient unless occupancy is very high or detectability is low. In both cases, the number of required visits increase. In an example of woodland bird monitoring in the Mt. Lofty Ranges, South Australia, we show that, although the budget required to monitor a relatively rare species of low detectability may be higher than that for a common, easily detectable species, survey design requirements for common species may be more stringent. We discuss implications for multi-species monitoring programs and application of our methods to more complex monitoring problems.},

  abstract = {There is a growing agreement that conservation needs to be proactive and pay increased attention to common species and to the threats they face. The blue sheep (Pseudois nayaur) plays a key ecological role in sensitive high-altitude ecosystems of Central Asia and is among the main prey species for the globally vulnerable snow leopard (Panthera uncia). As the blue sheep has been increasingly exposed to human pressures, it is vital to estimate its population dynamics, protect the key populations, identify important habitats, and secure a balance between conservation and local livelihoods. We conducted a study in Manang, Annapurna Conservation Area (Nepal), to survey blue sheep on 60 transects in spring (127.9 km) and 61 transects in autumn (134.7 km) of 2019, estimate their minimum densities from total counts, compare these densities with previous estimates, and assess blue sheep habitat selection by the application of generalized additive models (GAMs). Total counts yielded minimum density estimates of 6.0-7.7 and 6.9-7.8 individuals/km(2) in spring and autumn, respectively, which are relatively high compared to other areas. Elevation and, to a lesser extent, land cover indicated by the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) strongly affected habitat selection by blue sheep, whereas the effects of anthropogenic variables were insignificant. Animals were found mainly in habitats associated with grasslands and shrublands at elevations between 4,200 and 4,700 m. We show that the blue sheep population size in Manang has been largely maintained over the past three decades, indicating the success of the integrated conservation and development efforts in this area. Considering a strong dependence of snow leopards on blue sheep, these findings give hope for the long-term conservation of this big cat in Manang. We suggest that long-term population monitoring and a better understanding of blue sheep-livestock interactions are crucial to maintain healthy populations of blue sheep and, as a consequence, of snow leopards.},

Regular aerial surveys of macropods across large areas of Australia's arid and semi-arid rangelands were established as a response to concerns for the species' conservation. They became integral to the harvest management of the four macropod species - Eastern Grey Kangaroo (Macropus giganteus), Western Grey Kangaroo (M. fuliginosus), Red Kangaroo (Osphranter rufus) and Common Wallaroo (O. robustus). Harvest quotas are set as a proportion of population size, requiring absolute estimates of abundance. Counts were made in strip transects from fixed-wing aircraft, but required correction for animals that are missed. In New South Wales and Queensland, counts are now made using line transect sampling, providing survey-specific correction. Helicopters are used in more rugged and timbered areas and where Common Wallaroo can be more frequently found and harvested. Mark-recapture distance sampling is used in more open country that can be surveyed using fixed-wing aircraft and improves the accuracy of density estimates by accounting for animals missed on the transect line. Macropod populations are likely to be surveyed in the future by airborne imagery and by drones, but the technology needs further development. Spatial models could usefully provide small-scale density estimates and address non-random sampling.},

Periodic resting of rangelands could be used to manipulate plant cover and create wildlife habitat, but its effects may vary with prior grazing intensity. Using a large-scale manipulative grazing experiment conducted from 2006 to 2014 in Grasslands National Park, Canada, we evaluated how the effects of rest on vegetation and songbird abundance varied based on previous cattle stocking rates. Our results indicate that in northern mixed-grass prairies, grazing-induced changes were reversible, even at high stocking rates applied for up to four years. Both vegetation and songbirds were resilient to grazing, generally returning to levels observed prior to livestock reintroduction in three or fewer years following removal of livestock. Songbirds with flexible habitat requirements, such as Passerculus sandwichensis and Ammodramus savannarum, responded more rapidly to livestock exclusion. Recovery of both plant and songbird species occurred more rapidly in lowlands than uplands. The retrogressive nature of succession in North American mixed-grass prairies offers managers an opportunity to take chances when attempting to create wildlife habitat with livestock grazing, as risk of irreversible change is relatively low under moderate climate conditions.},

  abstract = {Tree cover is quantified using a variety of structural metrics that relate to canopy density, which are often modelled from remotely sensed data. Comparing different metrics, and maps of such metrics, is difficult due to a poor understanding as to how they relate to each other. Two commonly used metrics in Australia are crown projective cover (CPC) and foliage projective cover (FPC). CPC and FPC are the proportion of ground area covered by the vertical projection of tree crowns, and the foliage of tree crowns, respectively. They are dimensionless proportions that vary between zero and one. The relationship between CPC and FPC is a function of the plant area index (PAI), the foliage clumping factor at a zenith angle of zero, the foliage projection function at a zenith angle of zero, tree stand density, mean crown radii, and the proportion of wood to all canopy elements (alpha). The non-linear relationship was investigated using a dataset of 745 field sites across Australia, for which 1003 coincident CPC and FPC measurements had been made. As measurements of LAI and the other variables were not available, the parameter k was introduced to simplify the equations, which then had only two unknowns: a and k. Best-fit values of a and k were determined using non-linear weighted least-squares regression across all the field sites. Using these values to predict FPC from CPC, and vice versa, achieved low root mean square errors (0.05-0.07) across the field data. The models allow different mapping products to be compared, and also have the potential to facilitate the derivation of FPC from airborne lidar data when field measurements of FPC are not available for calibration. This was demonstrated using a lidar dataset and 12 coincident field sites, across which FPC was derived from a lidar fractional cover metric with an RMSE of 0.08. Further research is required to investigate the stability of this method across different areas and lidar systems.},

We translocated 57 adult A. polops from Green Cay to Buck Island in May 2008. We placed 4 females and 3 males each in eight, 100 m(2), enclosures on Buck Island for 71 days, then the enclosures were opened. During the enclosure period, 20 individuals were identified and 32 others were seen. The average number sighted per survey was only 5.28 (range = 2-10). One hatchling was sighted in an enclosure, indicating a translocated female successfully nested. Body condition of the translocated individuals increased significantly by the end of the enclosure period. Population monitoring surveys at 61 sites across Buck Island showed that 5 years after the initial translocation in June 2013, the new population had grown to an estimated 1,473 individuals and occupied 58.9\% of the island. We attribute eradication of mongoose, life history of the species, large propagule size, condition of habitat, soft-release, use of adults, interagency collaboration, and systematic assessment as primary factors that facilitated this successful translocation. Our findings provide meaningful insights on factors that enhance the potential for successful translocations, and point to new strategies aimed at restoring populations of endangered reptiles in their native ranges.},

  abstract = {Side-scan sonar (SSS) provides an efficient, nonintrusive sampling tool for many fisheries applications. Professional-grade systems have proven useful for species-specific detection of large, distinctive fishes; however, these systems are often cost prohibitive for widespread use. Lower-cost, consumer-grade systems are becoming increasingly popular for fisheries applications and have been used extensively to map aquatic habitat. However, these systems often produce lower-resolution imagery that may limit species-specific applications. We used experimental ponds stocked with known fish assemblages and a field-based mark-recapture study to determine the efficacy of a consumer-grade SSS system in surveying Alligator Gars Atractosteus spatula. Three ponds were stocked with known abundances of Alligator Gars and other sympatric fishes. A fourth pond remained unstocked to assess false positives; a fifth was stocked only with other species to quantify misidentification. Replicate sonar images of each pond were then recorded using a Humminbird 998c system. For the field-based application, we used gill nets to mark and recapture Alligator Gars and estimate population size within a closed backwater of the Guadalupe River, Texas. Following final recapture, we recorded replicate imagery of the backwater. Imagery from both evaluations was interpreted by three independent readers of varying experience without knowledge of image origin. The results from the ponds indicated a low rate of false detection (7\%) and misidentification (4\%). The number of Alligator Gars identified was positively related to density; however, the probability of detection varied among readers (range, 0.27-0.71) and was positively related to experience. In contrast, all readers estimated Alligator Gar abundance in the backwater within 10\% of the population estimated from the mark-recapture data. Our results suggest that low-cost SSS can provide an effective, noninvasive alternative to traditional sampling techniques for Alligator Gars.},

Limited information on roost site requirements exists across either species ranges; therefore, we conducted roost surveys for RBEB and SEM in bottomland and riparian hardwood forests on Noxubee National Wildlife Refuge, Legion State Park, and Tombigbee National Forest, Mississippi, during winter 2009-2010 and spring 2010. To compare seasonal roost selection for each species we compared tree species, used 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) for three tree variables (diameter at breast height (DBH), cavity volume, and opening area) and logistic regression for four landscape variables (elevation, slope, distance to nearest stream, and distance to nearest road). We used Akaike's Information Criteria corrected for small sample size and model averaging to incorporate model selection uncertainty into parameter estimates of landscape models. Based on 95\% CIs, RBEB and SEM in winter used trees with greater DBH and SEM used trees with larger cavities. However, during spring, RBEB and SEM occupied trees with comparable DBH and cavity size to unoccupied trees. At the landscape scale, RBEB used roost trees at lower elevations during winter and spring. During spring, SEM used trees further from roads (Importance weight = 0.76) at lower elevations (Importance weight = 0.29) and with less slope (Importance weight = 0.25). Understanding seasonal roost site selection will improve our ability to protect habitat to ensure viable populations of these bat species.},

  abstract = {A common error in many studies is that a species may go undetected when they are actually present, thus leading to underestimates of the true population. Because imperfect detection can affect population estimates, we calculated detection probabilities of two rare bat species, Rafinesque's big-eared bats (Corynorhinus rafinesquii; RBEB) and southeastern myotis (Myotis austroriparius; SEM), when roosting in tree cavities. We used two methods: repeated surveys of the same tree cavity and a removal method where a tree cavity was eliminated from future surveys after a bat was detected. When repeated surveys were conducted, detection probabilities were 95\% for each observer and 100\% for two observers combined (n = 43). Using the removal method, each observer independently detected bats in tree cavities in 92\% of inspections; whereas, combined observations of two surveyors improved detection probability to 99\% (n = 27). We also evaluated count error for species identification and abundance using a two-observer method and compared it to digital infrared imagery. Count errors were typically ¡4\% and 38\% when ¡= 20 bats and ¿20 bats were present, respectively, compared to digital images. When count errors occurred, most (64-73\%) underestimated the number of bats present. Observers correctly identified species on 91\% of occasions. Video recording tree cavities improved estimates of bat abundance and verified species composition. Repeated surveys and the removal method were similarly effective and suitable techniques for monitoring bat species occurrence; however, visual surveys were accurate for estimating abundance when number of bats was ¡= 20.},

Estimating population parameters for rare or cryptic plant species, however, can be challenging and thus developing and testing new methods is useful. We assessed the efficacy of distance sampling for estimating abundance and habitat associations of the endangered Pima pineapple cactus (Coryphantha scheeri var. robustispina), a rare plant in the Sonoran Desert of southwestern North America that has traditionally been surveyed with census-based methods. Distance sampling (DS) involves measuring distances between focal objects and samples of lines or points, and modeling detection functions that adjust estimates for variation in detection probability (P). Although often used in animal systems, DS remains largely untested for plants. We encountered 105 live individuals along 36.9 km of transects in 11 study plots placed across much of the geographic range of the species, and estimated an average density of 1.47 individuals/ha (CV = 0.139). Compared to values from intensive censuses, density estimates from DS were underestimated by only 2.3\% on average and highly correlated on the untransformed (r = 0.84) and logarithmic (r = 0.93) scales. Estimates of P averaged 0.49 and declined as soils became increasingly dominated by larger soil substrates, and somewhat with increasing vegetation volume and decreasing cactus height. Local densities increased with increasing slope and soil substrate size and decreased with increasing vegetation volume (P {$<$}= 0.024). Combined with careful survey design, DS offers an efficient method for estimating population parameters for uncommon and cryptic plants.},

Cactus ferruginous pygmy-owls (Glaucidium brasilianum cactorum; hereafter pygmy-owls) have declined in southwestern North America and are surveyed often to comply with federal law. We studied owl responses to broadcasted calls to quantify how detectability and response rates (owls/station/transect) vary with environmental, spatial, temporal, and weather-related factors. We surveyed owls along 392 transects (1,113 km) throughout Sonora, Mexico, including a subset of 14 transects (47.2 km) that we surveyed repeatedly to assess factors that affected response rates. We challenged 17 adults and 23 juveniles that were radiomarked, adults attending 50 occupied nests, and adults attending 6 groups of radiomarked juveniles to respond to broadcasted calls to assess factors that affected detectability. Across Sonora, response time averaged 2.6 +/- 0.1 minutes (x +/- SE, n = 520), with 99 +/- 0.4\% of owls detected in ¡= 8 minutes; response distance averaged 251 7 in, with 91 +/- 1\% of owls detected at ¡= 400 in. Response time decreased by an average of 4 +/- 2\% and response distance decreased by 12 3 in with each half-month period from early courtship through brooding (P ¡ 0.035). Response time averaged 39 +/- 24\% faster during morning than midday at occupied nests. Detectability was 1.0 +/- 0.0 when surveyors were 100 in from occupied nests and decreased to 0.78 +/- 0.10 when surveyors were 500 m from occupied nests. Detectability was higher during incubation, brooding, and natal dispersal (0.99 +/- 0.05-1.0 +/- 0.0) than during fledgling-dependency (0.50 +/- 0.20-0.67 +/- 0.19). Response rates of males did not vary from early courtship to brooding (P = 0.84), yet those of females decreased systematically to zero across the same period (P ¡ 0.001). Because detectability of pygmy-owls remains consistently high during nesting, response rates generated from carefully designed surveys can provide reliable estimates of occupancy and abundance.},

Our river survey approach incorporates a double-survey technique, whereby observers in two canoes simultaneously survey birds along a river reach. Data are in the form of a two-sample mark-recapture history, and covariates suspected of influencing detection probabilities can be included in the modeling process and evaluated using information-theoretic approaches. We provide an example using the method along the Madison and upper Missouri rivers in Montana. Overall, detection probabilities for each observer ranged from 57\% to 89\%, and combined detection probabilities (the likelihood of at least one observer detecting an individual) were consistently high (88\% across all species). Detection probabilities across species were positively correlated with body mass. Detection probabilities for some species were influenced by observer, river conditions, and whether species were in groups or alone; groups were more detectable, and individuals in slow-flowing and wide sections of river were more detectable. Boat-based double surveys are a viable method for estimating detection probabilities of birds in river habitats, and double surveys should be considered in other aquatic systems.},

  abstract = {Spotlighting (SL) is used widely to estimate animal abundance, but it yields density estimates that are underestimated and biased. Introduction of distance sampling has, to a large extent, contributed to solving these problems, but the reliability of this statistical method depends strongly on sample size. Thermal infrared (TI) imaging may improve number of observations, but very few studies have quantified performance of TI imaging relative to SL. This comparison is relevant because the high cost of a TI device is justified only by a significant increase of observations and a consequent reduction of labor costs. Our objectives were to compare animal detectability by SL and TI imaging as a function of animal size, species (red deer [Cervus elaphus], fallow deer [Dama dama], wild boar [Sus scrofa], red fox [Vulpes vulpes], European rabbit [Oryctolagus cuniculus], and brown hare [Lepus europaeus]), distance, and season. We also analyzed group size and composition for red deer and effect of grass height on detection of hares and rabbits. On average, TI imaging was more efficient (P{$<$}0.001) than SL, which detected only 53.8\% of the animals observed by TI imaging. This was especially true for wild boar (92.1\%), but both devices observed comparable red fox (P=0.60) and fallow deer (P=0.72) numbers. Relative detectability of the 2 devices was influenced by different factors: for red deer, TI was more efficient than SL in summer and autumn, but not in winter; male groups of red deer were better observed by TI imaging than by SL; and wild boars were better imaged at short (0-100-m) distances with TI. Relative effectiveness of both instruments was not influenced by grass height(P=0.92). Our results showed that wild boar should only be surveyed using TI imager and that a strong improvement of sample size can be obtained using TI for red deer, brown hare, and European rabbit.},

The Italian roe deer Capreolus capreolus italicits was recently confirmed to be a subspecies in Mediterranean habitats of central and southern Italy. We have monitored this subspecies at Castelporziano, near Rome, since 1988, and detected an abrupt population decline in 2001. We compared distance sampling surveys undertaken before and after the population crash to determine the ability of this method to detect variations in animal density and to investigate which factors may influence the precision of the estimates. We used radio tagged roe deer to evaluate the accuracy of our surveys, comparing distance sampling and mark-resight estimates at the same site, and studying the behavioural reaction of the animals to the presence of an observer. We found that before the crash distance sampling surveys attained a good precision but that the survey conditions influenced both precision and accuracy. Post-crash surveys were less precise, but the difference in density, before and after the crash was highly significant, indicating the potential of the method to quickly detect density variations and so to allow wildlife managers to react without delay to a crisis. The direct test of distance sampling assumptions showed that estimates were almost unbiased. We conclude that the methodology was successful for monitoring this population and that it may be used in other situations where ungulates are rare and efficient monitoring must be attained with restricted budgets.},

  abstract = {Hunted wild animals (i.e., bushmeat) are a main source of protein for many rural populations in the tropics, and the unsustainable harvest of these animals puts both human food security and ecosystem functioning at risk. To understand the correlates of bushmeat consumption, we surveyed 1219 households in 121 rural villages near three newly established national parks in Gabon. Through the surveys we gathered information on bushmeat consumption, income, and material assests. In addition, we quantified land cover in a 5-km radius around the village center and distance of the village center to the nearest park boundary. Bushmeat was not a source of income for most households, but it was the primary animal protein consumed. Ninety-seven percent of households consumed bushmeat at least once during a survey period of 12 days. Income or wealth, land cover, distance of village to the nearest park boundary, and level of education of the head of the household were among the factors that significantly related to the likelihood of consuming any of the 10 most commonly consumed species of bushmeat. Household size was the predictor most strongly associated with quantities of bushmeat consumed and was negatively related to consumption. Total bushmeat consumption per adult male equivalent increased as household wealth increased and decreased as distance of villages to park boundaries increased. Bushmeat consumption at the household level was not related to unit values (i.e., price estimates for a good that typically does not have a market value; estimates derived from willingness to sell or trade the good for items of known price) of bushmeat or the price of chicken and fish as potential substitutes. The median consumption of bushmeat at the village level, however, was negatively related to village mean unit values of bushmeat across all species. Our results suggest that a lack of alternative protein sources motivated even the wealthiest among surveyed households to consume bushmeat. Providing affordable, alternative protein sources to all households would likely reduce unsustainable levels of bushmeat consumption in rural Gabon.},

From September 2014 to January 2015, we surveyed birds in 264 point counts and 258 transects spread across the southern Brazilian grasslands. We conducted one method in direct sequence of the other, in the same place with the same observers and at the same weather conditions. We standardized data to eliminate the effort bias caused by area covered and time employed in each method. Total abundance of birds recorded by the two methods did not differ (point counts 4753 and transects 4436, P = 0.31), but we found a significant difference in species richness (point counts 187 and transects 173, P = 0.01). Abundance of birds sampled with the transect method showed a slightly higher correlation with vegetation height (r(2) = 0.07; P = 0.004) than the point counts method (r(2) = 0.03; P = 0.05). While results from both methods were similar, richness detection was more effective in point counts, indicating that this method might be more useful than it currently is.

  abstract = {Point counts are one of the most widely used and efficient approaches to survey land-bird populations. A new approach to point-count surveys involves the use of 2 observers, which allows the calculation of a detection probability for each bird species. Detection probabilities derived from 2 observers permit investigators to calculate a corrected abundance estimate that accounts for birds present but not detected. We evaluated 2 double-observer point count approaches: the dependent-observer approach and the independent-observer approach. The dependent-observer approach involves 2 observers recording data together on a single data sheet with one observer designated the primary observer and the other designated as the secondary observer. The primary observer verbally dictates the number of each species detected while the secondary observer records this information; the secondary observer also records birds that the primary observer did not detect. The independent-observer approach involves 2 observers recording data independently on separate data sheets without verbal communication between observers. This study compares the detection probabilities and associated levels of precision generated by both double-observer approaches to ascertain which technique generates data that are more accurate and more feasible to apply in the field. We conducted point counts at 137 point locations in northern West Virginia during the spring of 2000 and 2001 using both double-observer approaches. We generated detection probabilities and abundances from data collected using both double-observer approaches using program DOBSERV. The dependent-observer approach resulted in higher observer-specific and joint detection probabilities, as well as lower standard errors of detection probability across most cover types. Species-specific detection probabilities were higher across all cover types under the dependent-observer approach. Given the higher detection probabilities and associated precision combined with fewer logistical constraints, we suggest that the dependent-observer approach be used when investigators are interested in surveying birds using point counts.},

  abstract = {Avian points counts are commonly used to inventory bird species composition and abundance. When designing a study to inventory birds using point counts, point plot size and count duration are 2 variables that must be considered based on project goals. We conducted double-observer point counts on the Camp Dawson Collective Training Area, Preston County, West Virginia, during 2000 and 2001 to ascertain how detection probabilities and abundance estimates are affected by different plot sizes and durations. We conducted point counts from dawn to 1000 hours, and sub-tallied birds into different distance (0-¡50 m, 50-100 m, and ¿100 m) and time (0-¡3 minute, 3-5 minute, and ¿5-10 minute) intervals. We used program DOBSERV to generate species-specific detection rates and abundances for the different distance and time intervals. Detection probabilities were greatest for 50-m radius point counts and least for unlimited-radius counts (P ¡ 0.05). Three minute counts produced the greatest detection rates whereas probabilities were least for 10-minute counts (P ¡ 0.05). Abundance estimates were least for 50-m radius point counts and greatest for unlimited-radius counts (P ¡ 0.05). Three-minute counts produced the lowest abundances and 10-minute counts produced the greatest abundance estimates (P ¡ 0.05). Lower detection probabilities for 10-minute counts likely occurred because a majority of birds had already been recorded at the beginning of the count. Low detection probabilities with unlimited-radius point counts can be attributed to the increasing difficulty of detecting birds at longer distances. Abundance estimates were greater for 10-minute and unlimited-radius point counts because more time and area is available in which to detect birds. Project objectives will ultimately dictate the count duration and plot size to use when conducting avian point counts.},

Three different types of subsampling designs (random, systematic and systematic-cluster) with small sample sizes (50 and 64 points), obtained from this larger data set (200 points), are evaluated. The sensitivity of the spatial methods in the detection and the reconstruction of spatial patterns following the application of the various subsampling designs is discussed. We find that the type of sampling design plays an important role in the capacity of autocorrelation coefficients to detect significant spatial autocorrelation, and in the ability to accurately reconstruct spatial patterns by kriging. Sampling designs that contain varying sampling steps, like random and systematic-cluster designs, seem more capable of detecting spatial structures than a systematic design.},

  abstract = {Detecting population declines is a critical task for conservation biology. Logistical difficulties and the spatiotemporal variability of populations make estimation of population declines difficult. For statistical reasons, estimates of population decline may be biased when study sites are chosen based on abundance of the focal species. In this situation, apparent population declines are likely to be detected even if there is no decline. This site-selection bias is mentioned in the literature but is not well known. We used simulations and real population data to examine the effects of site-selection biases on inferences about population trends. We used a left-censoring method to detect population-size patterns consistent with site-selection bias. The site-selection bias is an important consideration for conservation biologists, and we offer suggestions for minimizing or mitigating it in study design and analysis.Article impact statement: Estimates of population declines are biased if studies begin in large populations, and time-series data show a signature of such an effect. Sesgos en la Seleccion de Sitios y las Declinaciones Poblacionales Aparentes en los Estudios a Largo Plazo La deteccion de las declinaciones poblacionales es una tarea muy importante para la biologia de la conservacion. Las dificultades logisticas y la variabilidad espacio-temporal de las poblaciones complican la estimacion de las declinaciones poblacionales. Por razones estadisticas, las estimaciones de las declinaciones poblacionales pueden estar sesgadas cuando se eligen los sitios de estudio con base en la abundancia de la especie focal. En esta situacion, las declinaciones poblacionales aparentes probablemente sean detectadas sin que exista dicha declinacion. Este sesgo en la seleccion del sitio esta mencionado en la literatura, pero sabe poco sobre el. Usamos simulaciones y datos de poblaciones reales para examinar los efectos que tienen los sesgos en la seleccion de sitio sobre las inferencias que se tienen sobre las tendencias poblacionales.

  abstract = {Conservation of Neotropical game species must take into account the livelihood and food security needs of local human populations. Hunting management decisions should therefore rely on abundance and distribution data that are as representative as possible of true population sizes and dynamics. We simultaneously applied a commonly used encounter-based method and an infrequently used sign-based method to estimate hunted vertebrate abundance in a 48,000-km2 indigenous landscape in southern Guyana. Diurnal direct encounter data collected during three years along 216, four-kilometer -long transects consistently under-detected many diurnal and nocturnal mammal species readily detected through sign. Of 32 species analyzed, 31 were detected by both methods; however, encounters did not detect one and under-detected another 12 of the most heavily hunted species relative to sign, while sign under-detected 12 never or rarely collected species relative to encounters. The six most important game animals in the region, all ungulates, were not encountered at 11–40\% of village and control sites or on 29–72\% of transects where they were detected by sign. Using the sign methodology, we find that tapirs, one of the terrestrial vertebrates considered most sensitive to overexploitation, are present at many sites where they were never visually detected during distance sampling. We find that this is true for many other species as well. These high rates of under-detection suggest that behavioral changes in hunted populations may affect apparent occurrence and abundance of these populations. Accumulation curves (detection of species on transects) were much steeper for sign for 12 of 16 hunted species than for encounters, but that pattern was reversed for 12 of 16 species unhunted in our area. We conclude that collection of sign data is an efficient and effective method of monitoring hunted vertebrate populations that complements encounter and camera-trapping methods in areas impacted by hunting. Sign surveys may be the most viable method for large-scale, management-oriented studies in remote areas, particularly those focused on community-based wildlife management.},

  abstract = {We used distance sampling to assess density and the detectability of male black grouse ( Tetrao tetrix) and rock ptarmigan ( Lagopus muta) in 2 protected areas of the Italian Alps. Our sampling effort was not sufficient to provide reliable inference for monitoring projects. Therefore, we used our field results to structure a simulation study to compare the performance of plot-based and distance sampling estimators of density. These 2 methods have different assumptions: plot sampling assumes a perfect detection of animals within the surveyed plots, whereas distance sampling assumes a decrease in detectability as the distance between observer and animal increases. The density and the detectability conditions adopted in the simulation were designed to be similar to those observed in our 2 studies, whereas the spatial patterns presumed for the simulated populations described a wide range of possible scenarios. Sampling points were allocated according to both random and stratified distributions. Simulation results showed that plot sampling underestimated density with bias invariably greater than 30\% and confidence intervals with coverage lower than the nominal level of 95\%. Conversely, distance sampling estimators provided bias levels invariably smaller than those obtained using plot sampling and bootstrap confidence intervals with empirical coverage near to or greater than 95\%. Based on our simulations, the distance sampling estimator was superior to the plot sampling estimator for these grouse species on our study areas in terms of precision and accuracy and the stratified allocation was superior to the random allocation. However, distance sampling would be very costly to implement. Based on our simulations, 4-5 points per km2 would be necessary to achieve reliable estimates of density and density changes. If distance sampling cannot be completed at this intensity, other sampling methods should be adopted. © 2014 The Wildlife Society.},

  abstract = {Large herbivores directly and indirectly influence ecosystem function, positively and negatively affecting diversity of plants and animals, including birds. Such cascading effects are clearly important, particularly given ongoing global declines in large herbivores and many avian communities. We examined relationships between bird diversity (species richness and Shannon-Weiner Index, at a species and functional group level) at three similarly vegetated and flooded sites in northern Botswana. We explored the role that herbivore presence plays in ecosystem functioning considering bird species richness was significantly higher at the site of intermediate presence, followed by the high presence site. At a functional group level, the site of highest presence consistently had the greatest functional group richness. Also, at a functional group level we identified higher species richness and diversity in the two sites where herbivores were present at high levels. This was particularly pronounced for the avian aquatic carnivore, terrestrial herbivore, and aerial invertivore functional groupings. Large herbivores probably increased habitat complexity through their browsing and grazing, altering habitat structure, alongside other benefits such as faeces deposition and mutualistic relationships, creating more niches for avian communities. Fencing out large herbivores to reduce their grazing and browsing may therefore reduce bird diversity, and correspondingly, allowing large herbivores to increase in abundance through protected areas may indirectly increase bird diversity, acknowledging over abundance may be detrimental.},

The unique avifauna of West Polynesia (Fiji, Tonga, Samoa) has been subjected to prehistoric human-caused extinctions but little was previously known about this topic in the Lau Group. We expected that the degree of human disturbance would be a strong determinant of tree species composition and habitat quality for surviving landbirds, while island area would be unrelated to bird diversity. Methodology/Principal Findings: All trees ¿5 cm diameter were measured and identified in 23 forest plots of 500 m(2) each. We recognized four forest species assemblages differentiated by composition and structure: coastal forest, dominated by widely distributed species, and three forest types with differences related more to disturbance history (stages of secondary succession following clearing or selective logging) than to environmental gradients (elevation, slope, rockiness). Our point counts (73 locations in 1 or 2 seasons) recorded 18 of the 24 species of landbirds that exist on the three islands. The relative abundance and species richness of birds were greatest in the forested habitats least disturbed by people. These differences were due mostly to increased numbers of columbid frugivores and passerine insectivores in forests on Lakeba and Aiwa Levu. Considering only forested habitats, the relative abundance and species richness of birds were greater on the small but completely forested (and uninhabited) island of Aiwa Levu than on the much larger island of Lakeba. Conclusions/Significance: Forest disturbance history is more important than island area in structuring both tree and landbird communities on remote Pacific islands. Even very small islands may be suitable for conservation reserves if they are protected from human disturbance.},

  abstract = {Avian predation on juvenile salmonids is an important source of mortality in freshwater and estuarine habitats when birds and salmonids overlap spatially and temporally. We assessed the potential impact of avian predation upon juvenile steelhead Oncorhynchus mykiss in a coastal watershed in central California. We conducted stream surveys between 2008 and 2010 to determine the composition, distribution, and density of piscivorous birds in areas that provide rearing habitat for juvenile steelhead. The most commonly sighted bird species were common mergansers Mergus merganser and belted kingfishers Megacyrle alcyon. The density of avian predators varied spatially and temporally but was greatest in the estuary regardless of season and decreased with increasing distance from the estuary. In the absence of local predator diet data, we applied a bioenergetics model to estimate the potential predation on juvenile steelhead by mergansers and kingfishers in the Scott Creek estuary. Model parameters included (1) published values of bird energetic requirements and steelhead energy density, (2) the number of birds present in the estuary during the closure period (from stream surveys), and (3) the size frequency and abundance of steelhead present in the estuary during closure. We predicted the extent of predation for different values of steelhead in bird diets, accounting for uncertainty in the estimates using a Monte Carlo simulation approach. With the assumed contribution of steelhead to the diet ranging from 20\% to 100\%, the population of kingfishers foraging in the Scott Creek estuary had the potential to remove 3-17\% of annual production, whereas mergansers had the potential to remove 5-54\% of annual steelhead production. Our results suggest that predation by avian species, particularly mergansers, is an important source of mortality for threatened steelhead populations in central California and should be addressed in future salmonid research and recovery planning.

Using a scaled physical model of a wading bird colony, we examined accuracy and variation in observer counts of simulated large numbers (200–6000) of densely nesting birds in vegetated situations. Observer estimates averaged 29\% less than true numbers (under- and overestimates averaged together), and the mean absolute value of observer errors was 49\% of true values. We found no effects of the size of the aggregation, the experience of the observer, the size of the previous aggregations surveyed by observers, the use of corrective lenses, or fatigue on degree of individual error. Over- and underestimates by individuals did not tend to cancel out in estimates by individuals of a “population” of colonies. Photographic counts of the same trials were significantly more accurate than observer estimates. We suggest that many studies using estimates of large numbers of birds may be confounded by similar errors. We urge that researchers use caution in interpreting the results of past surveys and develop ways to minimize, measure, and correct for visual estimation error within individuals and among observers.},

  abstract = {Counts of nest starts are often used as indicators of the size of avian nesting populations, or of avian productivity. However, the accuracy of single or repeated counts of unmarked nests over time for estimating seasonal numbers of nests may be strongly affected by nest events that fall in between survey dates, or that occurred prior to or after the survey period. Accuracy may also be affected by uncertainty in the interpretation of counts due to overlap between starting and ending dates of asynchronous nests during the intervisit interval. To measure the combined magnitude of these effects on survey accuracy, we overlaid a monthly “survey” regime on known initiation and ending dates of 2055 nests of ciconiiform birds. Assuming all nests present on the date of simulated survey were counted, monthly surveys underestimated the true number of nest starts by 24-64\%, depending on species and year. Using a simple model, we also demonstrate that accuracy does not increase much as survey frequency increases, and that significant estimation error can occur over a wide range of nest success values and degrees of asynchrony. We suggest that (1) these biases can be significant for surveys of many kinds of nesting birds including some territorial passerines, (2) this bias cannot be addressed by increasing survey frequency, and (3) the degree of renesting may be of critical interest for inferring breeding population size from nest count data. We suggest three possible approaches for modeling this error.},

  abstract = {The desert tortoise (Gopherus agassizii) was listed as a U.S. threatened species in 1990 based largely oil population declines interred from mark-recapture surveys of 2.59-km(2) (1-mi(2)) plots. Since then, several census methods have been proposed and tested, but all methods still pose logistical or statistical difficulties. We conducted computer simulations using actual tortoise location data front 2 1-mi(2) plot surveys in southern California, USA, to identify strengths and weaknesses of current sampling strategies. We considered tortoise population estimates based oil these plots as “truth” and then tested various sampling methods based oil sampling smaller plots or transect lines passing through the mile squares. Data were analyzed using Schnabel's mark-recapture estimate and program CAPTURE. Experimental subsampling with replacement of the 1-mi(2) data using 1-km(2) and 0.25-km(2) plot boundaries produced data sets of smaller plot sizes, which we compared to estimates front the 1-mi(2) plots. We also tested distance sampling by saturating a 1-mi(2) site with computer simulated transect lines, once again evaluating bias ill density estimates. Subsampling estimates from 1-km(2) plots did not differ significantly front the estimates derived at 1-mi(2). The 0.25-km(2) subsamples significantly overestimated population sizes, chiefly because too few recaptures were made. Distance sampling simulations Were biased 80\% of the time and had high coefficient of variation to density ratios. Furthermore, a prospective power analysis suggested limited ability to detect population declines as high as 50\%. We concluded that poor performance and bias of both sampling procedures was driven by insufficient sample Size, suggesting that all efforts must be directed to increasing numbers found in order to produce reliable results. Our results suggest that present methods may not be capable of accurately estimating desert tortoise populations.},

  abstract = {Structural analysis of forests by UAV is currently growing in popularity. Given the reduction in platform costs, and the number of algorithms available to analyze data output, the number of applications has grown rapidly. Forest structures are not only linked to economic value in forestry, but also to biodiversity and vulnerability issues. LiDAR remains the most promising technique for forest structural assessment, but small LiDAR sensors suitable for UAV applications are expensive and are limited to a few manufactures. The estimation of 3D-structures from two-dimensional image sequences called ‘Structure from motion’ (SfM) overcomes this limitation by photogrammetrically reconstructing point clouds similar to those rendered from LiDAR sensors. The result of these techniques in highly structured terrain strongly depends on the methods employed during image acquisition, therefore structural indices might be vulnerable to misspecifications in flight campaigns. In this paper, we outline how image overlap and ground sampling distances affect image reconstruction completeness in 2D and 3D. Higher image overlaps and coarser GSDs have a clearly positive influence on reconstruction quality. Therefore, higher accuracy requirements in the GSD must be compensated by a higher image overlap. The best results are achieved with an image overlap of {$>$} 95\% and a resolution of {$>$} 5 cm. The most important environmental factors have been found to be wind and terrain elevation, which could be an indicator of vegetation density.},

Reflectivity was positively correlated on all but I night with the number of birds detected aurally, but the correlation strength varied between -0.58 and 0.93 among nights (mean +/- SD = 0.69 +/- 0.42). Using linear mixed-effects models with aural counts nested within nights, we found that the number of birds detected by observers increased with reflectivity. `fhe slope of this relationship did not vary between observers, nor was it affected by time since sunset, but the number of birds detected aurally tended to be lower when ambient noise levels were high. We know that the radar was relatively sensitive to low bird densities, because the intercept was slightly positive and its 95\% confidence interval marginally included zero. However, the relationship between the number of birds detected aurally and reflectivity varied significantly among nights. Such variation was likely caused by a combination of (interacting) factors, including bird species and behavior (e.g., calling rate, flight altitude), influencing bird detectability by the observers and the radar. The weather radar network of the United States (NEXRAD) is already used for bird migration studies, and we conclude that the use of CWSR can extend NEXRAD's coverage farther north by hundreds of kilometers, thereby increasing Our understanding of how birds use the North American landscapes during migration.

We tested whether oxpeckers distributed themselves at random across individuals or aggregated on individual giraffes, and whether birds select the host's body parts with the expected greatest amount of ticks. By counting oxpeckers on giraffe's body from photographs, we quantified the distribution of birds per hosts and over predefined zones on the giraffe body. Oxpeckers displayed a strong aggregation behaviour with few hosts carrying many birds while many carried a limited number or no bird, a pattern that was most exaggerated for males. Oxpeckers were disproportionately found on the mane and back, where the density of ticks is presumably the highest. This high aggregation level of birds is typical of parasitic species and could suggest that oxpecker distribution may mirror the distribution of ticks, their primary food resource, on giraffes. Abundance of ticks appears as a major driver of the oxpecker foraging behaviour, and the oxpecker-large herbivores system proves to be highly relevant for the study of host-parasite dynamics.},

The eastern rosella (Platycercus eximius), a broad-tailed parakeet endemic to southeastern Australia, was introduced to New Zealand a century ago and is now geographically widespread. We studied the necessary timeframe for surveying the eastern rosella within its introduced range, testing the hypothesis that there are seasonal differences in the likelihood of detection. Although our comparisons were limited to surveys conducted during a single year, they are suggestive of an important impact of season on the survey duration required to detect eastern rosella confidently. Median latency until first detection was less during summer months (2.55 min) in comparison with winter months (11.2 min). Furthermore, 90\% of first detections occurred within the first 13 min in summer surveys, compared with 22 min in winter. These results have implications for the design of surveys aiming to monitor rosella populations in New Zealand, and reiterate the importance of tailoring survey methods to the species of interest.},

We also assessed the availability of birds to be detected using a closed-capture model and incorporated this with point-tran sect distance sampling. Abundance estimates from territory mapping and distance sampling were highly correlated, but biased for two species using line transects and five species using point transects. Six of the seven biased estimates were biased low. probabilities of detection were not significantly different between lines and points, and there was no significant difference in the overall accuracy between methods. Accounting for observer differences improved density estimates but reduced precision. The variance in accuracy was mostly related to the behavior of the different species. Adjusting for availability did not improve the overall accuracy of the estimates, because of the low singing rates of tropical birds. Nonetheless, distance sampling provided relatively robust estimates despite the near total dependence on aural Cues. Violations of distance-sampling assumptions may be frequent in heavily forested habitats, where both availability for detection and probability of detection on the transect line (or point) are likely to be ¡1.

  abstract = {Camera-traps are increasingly used to survey threatened mammal species and are an important tool for estimating habitat occupancy. To date, cost-efficient occupancy survey effort allocation studies have focused on tradeoffs between number of sample units (SUs) and sampling occasions, with simplistic accounts of associated costs which do not reflect camera-trap survey realities. Here we examine camera-trap survey costs as a function of the number of SUs, survey duration and camera-traps per SU, linking costs to precision in occupancy estimation. We evaluate survey effort trade-offs for hypothetical species representing different levels of occupancy (psi) and detection (p) probability to identify optimal design strategies. We apply our cost function to three threatened species as worked examples. Additionally, we use an extensive camera-trap data set to evaluate independence between multiple camera traps per SU. The optimal number of sampling occasions that result in minimum cost decrease as detection probability increases, irrespective of whether the species is rare (psi {$<$} 0.25) or common (psi {$>$} 0.5). The most expensive survey scenarios occur for elusive (p {$<$} 0.25) species with a large home range ({$>$}10 km(2)), where the survey is conducted on foot. Minimum survey costs for elusive species can be achieved with fewer sampling occasions and multiple cameras per SU. Multiple camera-traps set within a single SU can yield independent species detections. We provide managers and researchers with guidance for conducting cost-efficient camera-trap occupancy surveys. Efficient use of survey budgets will ultimately contribute to the conservation of threatened and data deficient mammals. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {The Eurasian Collared-Dove (Streptopelia decaocto) is one of the most successful invasive bird species across the world. Worryingly, the invasive dove is a known reservoir of many diseases, some of which can potentially infect mammals (including human beings). Additionally, aggressive behaviors have been recorded toward other bird species resulting in territory and nest usurpation. Thus, the presence of this species poses an important risk for native species with similar habits, particularly in insular systems. Based on this, we carried out this study to assess the density and distribution of the Eurasian Collared-Dove in the island of Cozumel, as well as to evaluate the relationship between their abundance and the environmental characteristics of the places they inhabit. We estimated their distance-corrected densities in the island's largest town and performed an inverse distance weighting (IDW) interpolation to visualize their distribution. We performed a generalized linear model (GLM) to assess relationships between the environmental variables and the abundance of doves using a reduced model procedure. We obtained 137 records of doves present in 94\% of all survey sites and an estimated density of 6.8 ind/ha, for a total of 6,670 doves in San Miguel de Cozumel. We did not find a spatial pattern of the dove's distribution on the urban setting, but we found an interaction between their abundances with tree cover and building height. Our findings, together with previous evidence of infection risk and aggressive behavior, make this species a threat to the native species communities of fragile ecosystems such as the island of Cozumel.},

Currently, these plant communities are the available habitats for wildlife and in the future they will possibly be some of the most wide-spread ecosystems world-wide. To understand the potential role of secondary forests for wildlife conservation, three ungulate species were studied: Mazama temama, Odocoileus virginianus and Pecari tajacu. We analyzed their relative abundance and habitat use at two spatial scales: (1) Local, where three different successional stages of tropical deciduous forest were compared, and (2) Landscape, where available habitats were compared in terms of landscape composition (proportion of forests, pastures and croplands within 113 ha). To determine the most important habitat-related environmental factors influencing the Sign Encounter Rate (SER) of the three ungulate species, 11 physical, anthropogenic and vegetation variables were simultaneously analyzed through model selection using Akaike’s Information Criterion. We found, that P. tajacu and O. virginianus mainly used early successional stages, while M. temama used all successional stages in similar proportions. The latter species, however, used early vegetation stages only when they were located in landscapes mainly covered by forest (97\%). P. tajacu and O. virginianus also selected landscapes covered essentially by forests, although they required smaller percentages of forest (86\%). All ungulate species avoided landscape fragments covered by pastures. For all three species, landscape composition and human activities were the variables that best explained SER. We concluded that landscape is the fundamental scale for ungulate management, and that secondary forests are potentially important landscape elements for ungulate conservation.},

Typically, DNA is used to identify individuals captured in an array of traps ( e. g., baited hair snares) from which individual encounter histories are derived. Standard methods for estimating the size of a closed population can be applied to such data. However, due to the movement of individuals on and off the trapping array during sampling, the area over which individuals are exposed to trapping is unknown, and so obtaining unbiased estimates of density has proved difficult. We propose a hierarchical spatial capture-recapture model which contains explicit models for the spatial point process governing the distribution of individuals and their exposure to ( via movement) and detection by traps. Detection probability is modeled as a function of each individual's distance to the trap. We applied this model to a black bear ( Ursus americanus) study conducted in 2006 using a hair-snare trap array in the Adirondack region of New York, USA. We estimated the density of bears to be 0.159 bears/km(2), which is lower than the estimated density (0.410 bears/km(2)) based on standard closed population techniques.

To describe relative changes in animal abundance, monitoring trends in numbers through indices may constitute a useful and low cost method, especially at large spatial scales. Reliability of indices to detect trends should be evaluated before they are used in wildlife management. We compared population trends estimated from spotlight counts, a standard census method for deer populations, with population size estimates of a red deer Cervus elaphus population monitored using Capture-Mark-Recapture (CMR) methodology. We found a strong negative effect of conditions of observation (e.g. rainfall) on both the number of animals (-24.4\%) and the number of groups (-31.6\%) seen per kilometre. After controlling for observation conditions, we found that these two abundance indices were linearly correlated with CMR estimates, with the group-based index being better correlated (r = 0.75) than the individual-based index (r = 0.68). These consistent trends between indices and CM R estimates provide support in using standardised spotlight counts as an IEC describing relative changes in abundance for the monitoring and management of red deer populations.},

  abstract = {Monitoring change in the population size of mouflon (Ovis gmelini musimon x Ovis sp.) in rugged areas is an important yet difficult task for wildlife ecologists. To assess population change of mouflon inhabiting the Caroux-Espinouse massif, France, we compared a pedestrian and helicopter survey, using counts of animals as indices of abundance. Environmental factors such as date of survey and temperature affected the detection of mouflons from the ground and the air. Both indices were sensitive to observed changes in population size. A decrease in the pedestrian index was recorded in 1994, the year following an epizootic of keratoconjunctivitis, which markedly reduced the survival rate of mouflon. Variations in pedestrian index accounted for variations in harvests when excluding epizootic events. Both surveys detected a decrease in population size, which accounted for the recent increase of harvest. Helicopter and pedestrian surveys are reliable tools to monitor annually mouflons in mountainous areas. Simulations indicated that helicopter surveys should be preferred by managers because they provide the best trade-off between cost and precision.},

  abstract = {Many studies have established that birds may provide a pest removal service on farms, although few studies have taken place in temperate row crop agriculture. Wildlife-friendly agricultural practices such as organic farming and the use of hedgerows can in turn provide needed habitat for birds in developed landscapes. In this study, we examined how pest removal provided by birds varies within and between “wildlife-friendly” organic row-crop farms in northern California, USA. We used point counts to assess bird diversity on 29 small organic farms and simulated lepidopteran pest outbreaks on each farm using sentinel pest experiments. We measured how the probability of pest removal varied with local habitat characteristics within the farm, and with bird diversity parameters between farms. We also used exclosure experiments to determine whether birds provide a significant pest removal service in organic row-crop agriculture. In the sentinel pest experiments, birds depredated between 0 and 80\% of caterpillar presentation stations within 7 h, with a mean of 24\% depredation per farm; the probability of pest removal was higher in areas close to uncultivated shrubby field margins (”hedgerows”). There was only weak evidence that the probability of pest removal was higher on farms with higher avian insectivore richness, and no evidence that pest removal varied with species diversity or abundance. Exclosure experiments on kale crops showed no significant effects of bird exclosure treatment on arthropod abundance or crop yield. However, natural caterpillar densities were relatively low during the exclosure experiment (approximately one caterpillar/m(2)). These results suggest that birds may be more helpful in responding to pest outbreaks than in controlling pests at non-irruptive densities on organic row crop farms in this study system. The prevention of pest outbreaks is an essential ecosystem service on any farm, and the rapid response of birds to pest outbreak conditions is an indicator of resiliency in the agroecosystem. Therefore, the retention of uncultivated shrubby field margins in this system may benefit both birds and farmers. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Despite the evidence that many flora and fauna species have detection probabilities of less than one, it is still the default assumption of most environmental impact assessment processes that if a species is present, it will be detected. Here we briefly review a number of existing studies that have estimated the survey effort necessary to detect animal species, based on what is known about their detection rates in standard surveys. We then propose a novel method, based on failure-time analysis, for quantifying the detectability of and determining appropriate survey effort for plant species during flora surveys. We provide computer code for implementing the method in the Bayesian freeware WinBUGS. Methods for estimating detectability can be used to inform minimum survey requirements and have important applications in environmental impact assessment and monitoring.},

Though sampling effort has varied over the dataset range, the size of the dataset is unprecedented within the field of amphibian ecology. With more than 2,480 individual species sampling dates and more than 151,701 recorded individual occurrences of the nine amphibian species, the described dataset represents the longest and largest time-series of herpetological sampling with paired water quality data. New information We describe the novel publication of a paired dataset of amphibian occurrence with environmental indicators spanning nearly 90 years of data collection. As of February 2020, the dataset includes 2,480 sampling dates across eleven vernal pools and 151,701 unique occurrences of egg masses or individuals recorded across nine species of amphibian. The dataset also includes environmental conditions associated with the species occurrences with complete coverage for air temperature and precipitation records and partial coverage for a variety of other weather and water quality measures. Data collection has included species, egg mass and tadpole counts; weather conditions including precipitation, sky and wind codes; water quality measurements including water temperature and pH; and vernal pool assessment including depth and surface vegetation coverage. Collection of data was sporadic from 1931-1991, but data have been collected consistently from 1991 to present. We also began monitoring dissolved oxygen, nitrate concentrations and conductivity of the vernal pools using a YSI Sonde Professional Plus Instrument and turbidity using a turbidity tube in February 2018. The dataset (and periodic updates), as well as metadata in the EML format, are available in the Environmental Data Initiative Repository under package edi.398},

Bird presence at a lake was positively correlated with steep rocky littoral zones and high densities of caddisfly (Trichoptera) larvae. We also observed numerous successful foraging bouts on juvenile life stages of lentic-breeding amphibians. We did not find any nests at the lakes but did observe juvenile dippers. American Dippers are highly adapted to flowing waters, and our findings coupled with incidental observations from the literature and other researchers, suggests that high elevation lentic waterbodies have been largely overlooked as a seasonal niche for migrant dippers.},

We examined 100 studies that empirically identify targeted resources, techniques used to procure resources illegally, locations of illegal activities, characteristics of typical violators, incentives driving illegal use of resources, magnitude of the problem of illegal use (e. g., quantities used), or frequency of illegal activity. We based our evaluation of the methods used in these studies on their ability to provide these empirical data, relative labor demands, training and technology requirements, and levels of uncontrollable bias. We evaluated eight different methods: law-enforcement records, indirect observation, self-reporting, direct observation, direct questioning, randomized response technique (a survey method designed to improve accuracy of responses to sensitive questions), forensics, and modeling. Different situations favored different methods, each with distinct advantages and limitations. Six context-specific factors-location of resource use (in situ vs. ex situ), budget, technology and training capacity, ease of detection of illegal activity, scope of illegal activity (limited vs. widespread), and researchers' willingness to accept bias in results-help narrow the choice of methods. Several methodological concerns applied to any study of illegal resource use: regular monitoring can detect trends; modeling can incorporate sampling error and data uncertainties; researchers must manage levels of bias that vary between methods; triangulation of results from multiple methods can improve accuracy. No method is a panacea, but a combination of techniques can help address the lack of data on illegal activity. Researchers empirically compared results from different methods in only four studies, and no one has compared more than two methods simultaneously. Conservation would benefit from more research focused on: methods comparisons that include cost effectiveness, time efficiency, and statistical rigor; unique applications of the eight techniques currently in use; and testing of new methods.},

  abstract = {Protected area coverage has reached over 15\% of the global land area. However, the quality of management of the vast majority of reserves remains unknown, and many are suspected to be "paper parks". Moreover, the degree to which management can be enhanced through targeted conservation projects remains broadly speculative. Proven links between improved reserve management and the delivery of conservation outcomes are even more elusive. In this paper we present results on how management effectiveness scores change in protected areas receiving conservation investment, using a globally expanded database of protected area management effectiveness, focusing on the "management effectiveness tracking tool" (METT). Of 1934 protected areas with METT data, 722 sites have at least two assessments. Mean METT scores increased in 69.5\% of sites while 25.1\% experienced decreases and 5.4\% experienced no change over project periods (median 4 years). Low initial METT scores and longer implementation time were both found to positively correlate with larger increases in management effectiveness. Performance metrics related to planning and context as well as monitoring and enforcement systems increased the most while protected area outcomes showed least improvement. Using a general linear mixed model we tested the correlation between change in MEIT scores and matrices of 1) landscape and protected area properties (i.e. topography and size), 2) human threats (i.e. road and human population density), and 3) soda-economics (i.e. infant mortality rate). Protected areas under greater threat and larger protected areas showed greatest improvements in MET. Out results suggest that when funding and resources are targeted at protected areas under greater threat they have a greater impact, potentially including slowing the loss of biodiversity.

  abstract = {Livestock is represented in big cat diets throughout the world. Husbandry approaches aim to reduce depredation, which may influence patterns of prey choice, but whether felids have a preference for livestock or not often remains unclear as most studies ignore livestock availability. We assessed prey choice of the endangered Persian leopard (Panthera pardus saxicolor) in Golestan National Park, Iran, where conflict over livestock depredation occurs. We analyzed leopard diet (77 scats) and assessed wild and domestic prey abundance by line transect sampling (186 km), camera-trapping (2777 camera days), double-observer point-counts (64 scans) and questionnaire surveys (136 respondents). Based on interviews with 18 shepherds, we estimated monthly grazing time outside six villages with 96 conflict cases to obtain a small livestock (domestic sheep and goat) availability coefficient. Using this coefficient, which ranged between 0.40 and 0.63 for different villages, we estimated the numbers of sheep and goats available to leopard depredation. Leopard diet consisted mainly of wild boar (Sus scrofa) (50.2\% biomass consumed), but bezoar goat (Capra aegagrus) was the most preferred prey species (I-j = 0.73), whereas sheep and goats were avoided (Ij = -0.54). When absolute sheep and goat numbers (similar to 11250) were used instead of the corrected ones (similar to 6392), avoidance of small livestock appeared to be even stronger (Ij = -0.71). We suggest that future assessments of livestock choice by felids should incorporate such case-specific corrections for spatiotemporal patterns of availability, which may vary with husbandry methods. Such an approach increases our understanding of human-felid conflict dynamics and the role of livestock in felid diets.},

Knowledge of population trends of exploited species and incentives for poaching is necessary to inform appropriate conservation measures. We estimated the abundance of four ungulate species in Golestan National Park, Iran, the country's oldest protected area, where poaching of ungulates is widespread. We used line transect surveys (186 km), camera trapping (2,777 camera-nights), point counts (64 scans) and dung counts (along 38 km), and compared population estimates with those from earlier records. We also investigated the incentives for poaching, using a semi-structured interview survey. Population estimates for 2011-2014 indicated a 66-89\% decline in three ungulate species (bezoar goat Capra aegagrus, red deer Cervus elaphus and urial Ovis vignei) compared to 1970-1978. Only wild boar Sus scrofa showed a population increase (of 58\%) during the same period, possibly facilitated by religious restrictions regarding the consumption of this species. The incentives for poaching were categorized (in a non-ordinal manner) as subsistence, pleasure, tradition, trade of wild meat, and conflict with conservation regulations and bodies. The decline in hunted ungulates in this Park appears to be the result of rampant poaching, and a similar trend is evident in other protected areas in the country. We suggest the adoption of participatory conservation strategies, improvement of law enforcement practices and cooperation with international experts to reduce poaching in these protected areas. Taking into account the incentives for poaching, a combination of economic and non-economic strategies should be considered.},

  abstract = {Overexploitation of wildlife for meat is a widespread phenomenon, which drives populations of many species toward extinction and may in turn affect large carnivores. Therefore, human hunters may compete with large carnivores over food resources and threaten their survival. In this study, we assessed the trophic competition of endangered Persian leopard with local poachers in Golestan National Park, Iran, where poaching has depleted populations of three ungulate species by 66-89\% in the past decades. We compared leopard diet (77 scats) with prey offtake by poachers (75 poacher seizure records). In addition, we estimated prey abundance by line transect sampling (186 km), camera trapping (2777 camera days), double-observer point-counts (64 scans) and dung counts (38 km). Using interview surveys with local poachers, we also quantified their stated hunting preference. We documented a narrow hunting specialization of leopard (niche breadth 0.24) and poachers (niche breadth 0.19), and exclusivity (niche overlap 0.31) of their dietary/hunting niches, which suggest no exploitative competition between these two apex predators. This pattern likely results from the major role of wild boar in leopard diet. Due to religious beliefs, poachers avoid hunting this species and its population has increased in contrast to other ungulates. Considering the general avoidance of Suidae species across leopard range, depletion of alternative prey species may have resulted in a prey-switching strategy by leopard. The influence of religious beliefs and taboos on hunting preference and, consequently, on prey populations and predators' trophic niches shows the importance of incorporation of cultural beliefs in conservation practices.

  abstract = {This book discusses a broad range of statistical design and analysis methods that are particularly well suited to pollution data. It explains key statistical techniques in easy-to-comprehend terms and uses practical examples, exercises, and case studies to illustrate procedures. Dr. Gilbert begins by discussing a space-time framework for sampling pollutants. He then shows how to use statistical sample survey methods to estimate average and total amounts of pollutants in the environment, and how to determine the number of field samples and measurements to collect for this purpose. Then a broad range of statistical analysis methods are described and illustrated. These include:  determining the number of samples needed to find hot spots analyzing pollution data that are lognormally distributed testing for trends over time or space estimating the magnitude of trends comparing pollution data from two or more populations  New areas discussed in this sourcebook include statistical techniques for data that are correlated, reported as less than the measurement detection limit, or obtained from field-composited samples. Nonparametric statistical analysis methods are emphasized since parametric procedures are often not appropriate for pollution data. This book also provides an illustrated comprehensive computer code for nonparametric trend detection and estimation analyses as well as nineteen statistical tables to permit easy application of the discussed statistical techniques. In addition, many publications are cited that deal with the design of pollution studies and the statistical analysis of pollution data. This sourcebook will be a useful tool for applied statisticians, ecologists, radioecologists, hydrologists, biologists, environmental engineers, and other professionals who deal with the collection, analysis, and interpretation of pollution in air, water, and soil.},

  abstract = {Preservation of biodiversity is a central goal of conservation management, yet the conditions that promote persistence may differ for the species in the community. For systems subject to stochastic disturbances such as fire, understanding which management practices promote persistence for all species in a community is complex. Before deciding on the best course of action, an objective must be specified. Yet an overarching goal of species persistence can be specified into a measureable objective many different ways. We investigated four alternative management objectives for maximizing species persistence that use common biodiversity indices: (1) attaining the minimally acceptable mix of successional vegetation states to support species’ relative abundances, (2) maximizing the arithmetic mean abundance of species, (3) maximizing the geometric mean abundance of species, and (4) minimizing the average extinction risk of species. We used stochastic dynamic programming to model successional changes in vegetation in the presence of both planned and unplanned fires, and utilize an extensive data set on the occurrence of birds, reptiles, and small mammals in different successional states in semiarid Australia. We investigated the influence the choice of objective function and taxonomic focus has on the optimal fire management recommendations. We also evaluated a recent hazard reduction policy to annually burn a fixed amount of the landscape and compare results to the optimal solution. The optimal management strategy to maximize species persistence over a 100-year period is predominantly to minimize wildfires. This is because the majority of species are more likely to occur in intermediate and late successional vegetation. However the optimal solution showed sensitivity to the objective and the species included in the analysis. These results highlight the need for careful consideration when specifying an objective to represent overarching conservation goals. Using the extinction risk objective, we show that a policy to annually burn 5\% of the landscape could increase the average probability of extinction for the modelled species by 7\% over the next 100 years compared to the optimal management scenario.},

  abstract = {Understanding how land-use changes affect different facets of plant biodiversity in seminatural European grasslands is of particular importance for biodiversity conservation. As conclusions of previous experimental or synchronic observational studies did not converge toward a general agreement, assessing the recent trends in vegetation change in various grassland systems using a diachronic approach is needed. In this resurvey study, we investigated the recent changes in grassland vegetation of the French Jura Mountains, a region with a long tradition of pastoralism. We compared the floristic composition of 150 grassland plots recorded between 1990 and 2000 with new releves made in 2012 on the same plots. We considered taxonomic, phylogenetic and functional diversity as well as ecological characteristics of the plant communities derived from ecological indicator values and life strategies of the species. PCA of the floristic composition revealed a significant general trend linked to the sampling year. Wilcoxon paired tests showed that contemporary communities were generally more dominated by grass species and presented a higher tolerance to defoliation, a higher pastoral value, and a higher nutrient indicator value. Comparisons revealed a decrease in phylogenetic and functional diversity. By contrast, local species richness has slightly increased. The intensity of change in species composition, measured by Hellinger distance between pairs of releves, was dependent on neither the time lag between the two surveys, the author of the first releve nor its location or elevation. The most important changes were observed in grasslands that previously presented low pastoral value, low grass cover, low tolerance to defoliation, and high proportion of stress-tolerant species. This trend was likely linked to the intensification of grassland management reported in the region, with a parallel increase in mowing frequency, grazing pressure, and fertilization level. More restrictive specifications should be applied to agricultural practices to avoid overexploitation of mountain species-rich grasslands and its negative consequences on their biodiversity and resilience.},

The performance of thermal imaging for estimating deer density by distance sampling was assessed in seven forest deer populations. Thermal imaging equipment can detect the long-wave energy. radiated by natural objects, clearly revealing warm-bodied animals even if partly obscured by vegetation. 4. Many more deer were detected at night using a thermal imager than along the same transect routes in daytime. Detection distances were correlated with visibility but were substantially longer than the average distances at which most animals were disturbed. Most deer were detected without causing prior disturbance. 5. Densities were estimated with a coefficient of variation ranging from 10.2-28.4\%. Precision depended on sampling effort and sample sizes obtained. 6. A Monte Carlo simulation revealed a quadratic relationship between accuracy and visibility, with accuracy increasing with average visibility and a tendency for deer to select more open habitats within a forest. Under conditions that are likely to be typical of temperate forests ({$<$}40\% thicket and neutral selection, or {$<$}70\% thicket if thicket is avoided), accuracy was generally good and changed relatively little in relation to visibility and habitat selection. 7. Likely sources of bias as well as alternatives to thermal imaging are discussed.

Important advances in the analysis of individual movement, and in the modelling of population dynamics and species distributions, are made possible by the increasing use of hierarchical and hidden process models.

In the modified procedure, all new tracks between two monitoring patrols are recorded.

The outputs of models with different lagged monitoring dates (3-10 days) are compared with the outputs of daily surveys using extrapolations from high and low density populations. Results show that the quality of the estimates is similar when total time series analysis is compared with situations in which only a fourth, a seventh, or a tenth of monitoring daily during the season are used. This solution permits the reallocation of funds from monitoring to other conservation activities. Furthermore, the efficient sampling design and the statistical methods allow getting similar information with less effort.},

However, the performance of distance-sampling abundance estimates has seldom been evaluated for wild mammal populations of known size.Aims. We evaluated the precision, accuracy, bias and interval coverage of abundance estimates from walked line-transect sampling, a commonly used distance-sampling method, for a marked free-ranging population of eastern grey kangaroos (Macropus giganteus) at Yanakie Isthmus, Wilsons Promontory National Park, south-eastern Australia.Methods. In each of two study periods (November 2012 and May 2013) we first determined the true size of the uniquely marked kangaroo population by conducting 10 intensive searches of the study area. We then conducted distance sampling along six systematically spaced line transects. We walked each transect four times in November 2012 and seven times in May 2013. Data were analysed using Program DISTANCE.Key results. Our intensive searches revealed that 141 and 124 collared kangaroos were present in the study area in November 2012 and May 2013, respectively. When transects were walked four or more times (i.e. ≥400 observations), maximum precision (coefficient of variation; CV of ∼13\%) was achieved in both survey periods. Walking transects twice (i.e. ∼200 observations) produced abundance estimates with CVs of {$<$}20\% in each study period. The accuracy (root mean square error) of abundance estimates varied from 1 to 13 (November 2012) and from 3 to 28 (May 2013). Bias ranged from −9\% to 23\%, but stabilised at between −1\% and −9\% when transects were walked four or more times in each study period. The 95\% confidence intervals for the abundance estimates always included the true population size.Conclusions. Our results indicated that walked line-transect distance sampling is a precise and accurate method for estimating eastern grey kangaroo abundance. The small negative biases that occurred when sample sizes were large were likely to be due to some animals moving outside the study area.Implications. Provided that the key design elements and assumptions are met, estimates of kangaroo abundance from walked line-transect distance sampling should have good precision (CV {$<$} 20\%) and minimal ({$<$}10\%) bias.},

  abstract = {Vegetation cover and composition are two indicators commonly used to monitor terrestrial ecosystems. These indicators are currently quantified with a number of different methods. The interchangeability and relative benefits of different methods have been widely discussed in the literature, but there are few published comparisons that address multiple criteria across a broad range of grass- and shrub-dominated communities, while keeping sampling effort (time) approximately constant. This study compared the utility of three field sampling methods for ecological assessment and monitoring: line-point intercept, grid-point intercept, and ocular estimates. The criteria used include: (1) interchangeability of data, (2) precision, (3) cost, and (4) value of each method based on its potential to generate multiple indicators. Foliar cover by species was measured for each method in five plant communities in the Chihuahuan Desert. Line- and grid-point intercept provide similar estimates of species richness which were lower than those based on ocular estimates. There were no differences in the precision of the number of species detected. Estimates of foliar cover with line- and grid-point intercept were similar and significantly higher than those based on ocular estimates. Precision of cover estimates with line-point intercept was higher than for ocular estimates. Time requirements for the three methods were similar, despite the fact that the point-based methods included cover estimates for all canopy layers and the soil surface, while the ocular estimates included only the top canopy layer. Results suggest that point-based methods provide interchangeable data with higher precision than ocular estimates. Moreover these methods can be used to generate a much greater number of indicators that are more directly applicable to a variety of monitoring objectives, including soil erosion and wildlife habitat.

This study aimed to develop an effective approach for long-term monitoring of the yellow-bellied glider (Petaurus australis) in north-east New South Wales. We conducted repeat surveys to account for imperfect detection and used counts in abundance modelling to produce indices of abundance. We used simulations to explore refinements to our study design. Surveys over three consecutive years produced 195 detections with {$>$}95\% of detections by call. The probability of detection varied across years and survey occasions, ranging from 0.22 to 0.71. Abundance estimates were remarkably constant across years, ranging from 2.3 ± 0.5 to 2.4 ± 0.6 individuals per site. Occupancy estimates were also constant across years (0.90–0.91). Simulations were run to investigate the influence of the number of surveys (2 or 3) and the number of survey sites (20, 40 or 50) on the probability of occupancy. The design that reduced bias and provided an adequate improvement to precision was that of three visits to 40 survey sites. This design should be adequate to detect a decline in population abundance. Further studies of this kind are needed to better understand the population dynamics of this species.},

The two main survey methods for estimating avian abundance are point counts and transects. Previous comparisons of these two methods have either been limited to a single species or have not included detection probability. During the 2012 breeding season, we compared and assessed the efficiency (precision for amount of effort) of point count time of detection (PCTD) and dependent double-observer transect (TRMO) methods based on detection probabilities and abundance estimates of five species of songbirds that use a range of habitats in a prairie system in Montana dominated by sagebrush and grassland vegetation. Our focal species included Vesper Sparrows (Pooecetes gramineus), a generalist species found in both shrub and grassland habitat, shrub-obligate Brewer's Sparrows (Spizella breweri), and McCown's Longspurs (Rhynchophanes mccownii), Horned Larks (Eremophila alpestris), and Western Meadowlarks (Sturnella neglecta), three species of grassland obligates that prefer different grass heights. Detection probabilities were significantly higher for TRMO surveys, with less variation for all five species and differences most pronounced for Brewer's Sparrows and Horned Larks. PCTD surveys required less field effort (similar to 8-20 fewer people minutes per plot) than TRMO surveys because the TRMO surveys required two people. However, time spent on TRMO surveys provided between 0.38 and 87 times more precision per people minute than PCTD surveys. Our results suggest that TRMO surveys provide a more efficient (measured as time spent per unit of standard error) field-based technique in sagebrush prairie systems for the species we investigated, resulting in more precise detection and abundance estimates.},

However, false-positive errors (misidentification or double counts), which are prevalent in multispecies data sets, remain largely unaddressed. The dependent-double observer (DDO) method is an emerging method that both accounts for detection error and is suggested to reduce the occurrence of false positives because it relies on two observers working collaboratively to identify individuals. To date, the DDO method has not been combined with advantages of multispecies N-mixture models. Here, we derive an extension of a multispecies N-mixture model using the DDO survey method to create a multispecies dependent double-observer abundance model (MDAM). The MDAM uses a hierarchical framework to account for biological and observational processes in a statistically consistent framework while using the accurate observation data from the DDO survey method. We demonstrate that the MDAM accurately estimates abundance of multiple species with simulated and real multispecies data sets. Simulations showed that the model provides both precise and accurate abundance estimates, with average credible interval coverage across 100 repeated simulations of 94.5\% for abundance estimates and 92.5\% for detection estimates. In addition, 92.2\% of abundance estimates had a mean absolute percent error between 0\% and 20\%, with a mean of 7.7\%. We present the MDAM as an important step forward in expanding the applicability of the DDO method to a multispecies setting. Previous implementation of the DDO method suggests the MDAM can be applied to a broad array of biological communities. We suggest that researchers interested in assessing biological communities consider the MDAM as a tool for deriving accurate, multispecies abundance estimates.},

  abstract = {Grazing on natural rangelands, which are areas dominated by native vegetation that are used for livestock grazing, can achieve desired vegetation outcomes, preserve native habitat, and economically benefit multiple stakeholders. It is a powerful tool that can be manipulated to reduce wildlife declines and benefit ecosystems. However, the benefits of conservation grazing systems on many wildlife communities remain relatively unexplored. We compared songbird communities between two grazing systems in eastern Montana: rest-rotation, which is a conservation grazing system, and season-long. We measured differences in abundance of eight songbird species over a two year period using dependent double-observer transect surveys and a multispecies dependent double-observer abundance model. The species were chosen to be representative of the sagebrush grassland community: a sagebrush obligate, Brewer's sparrow (Spizella brewed); a faculatative grassland species, brown-headed cowbird (Molothrus ater); grassland obligate species, chestnut-collared longspur (Calcarius ornatus), horned lark (Eremophila alpestris), lark bunting (Calamospiza melanocorys), McCown's longspur (Rhynchophanes mccownii), and western meadowlark (Sturnella neglecta); and a generalist, vesper sparrow (Pooecetes gramineus). Our results show that these species exhibit mixed responses to these two grazing systems. The sagebrush obligate (Brewer's sparrow), generalist (vesper sparrow), and two grassland associated species (horned lark and chestnut-collared longspur) were equally abundant on both grazing systems, suggesting grazing system had no effect on their abundance. However, the remainder of the grassland associated species showed a response to grazing: three (brown-headed cowbird, lark bunting, and western meadowlark) were more abundant in season-long than rest-rotation, whereas one (McCown's longspur) was more abundant in rest-rotation. These results suggest that differences in grazing management affect a subset of grassland obligate species and that only one species, McCown's longspur, preferred conservation grazing. Our findings provide useful information for assessing the suitability of grazing as a conservation tool for songbirds. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Monitoring and mapping of land cover and land cover change in a consistent and robust manner over large areas is made possible with Earth Observation (EO) data. Land cover products satisfying a range of science and policy information needs are currently produced periodically at different spatial and temporal scales. The increased availability of EO data—particularly from the Landsat archive (and soon to be augmented with Sentinel-2 data)—coupled with improved computing and storage capacity with novel image compositing approaches, have resulted in the availability of annual, large-area, gap-free, surface reflectance data products. In turn, these data products support the development of annual land cover products that can be both informed and constrained by change detection outputs. The inclusion of time series change in the land cover mapping process provides information on class stability and informs on logical class transitions (both temporally and categorically). In this review, we present the issues and opportunities associated with generating and validating time-series informed annual, large-area, land cover products, and identify methods suited to incorporating time series information and other novel inputs for land cover characterization.},

  abstract = {Recent declines in biodiversity stress the need for rigorous and reliable multispecies monitoring programs. A potential weakness of monitoring programs is a reliance on raw counts and the assumption either of complete detection or of constant detection probability for each species, regardless of the sampling situation. Until recently, these assumptions have largely remained untested and, therefore, to help insure accuracy, bird-monitoring programs have depended on standardization of counts and counts of longer duration. We tested the effectiveness of these strategies for providing unbiased occupancy rates using a method designed to accommodate situations where species detection probabilities are less than one and heterogeneous. We tested the effect of potential sources of heterogeneity in detection probability (vegetation structure, wind velocity, cloud cover, date, and time) on occupancy rate estimates of 13 bird species in southern France. We compared adjusted and raw occupancy rates for two sampling durations (10 and 20 min). Differences between raw and adjusted occupancy rates were low even for the shorter count duration, suggesting that standardized long counts should produce reliable estimates of occupancy rates even in the absence of correction by an appropriate method. This enhances the value of past monitoring programs where long standardized counts were used, but with designs that do not allow corrected estimates. However, we found that detection probability was heterogeneous for most species and that vegetation structure was an important source of heterogeneity. The possible effects of habitat on detection probability should be of special concern for long-term monitoring programs conducted in landscapes where habitats vary across time or space.},

  abstract = {1. An index-calibration experiment involves rigorous estimation of animal abundance at a small scale to calibrate a less rigorously derived index of abundance. The efficacy of such index-calibration experiments has been a matter of much controversy. In this study, we develop theoretical models and test them with empirical data on large-scale index-calibration experiments on tigers Panthera tigris to advance our understanding of this controversy. 2. We propose two models that describe the sampling processes involved in typical index-calibration experiments. Using analytical derivations and some simulations, we evaluate the relative roles of these sampling parameters on the R-2 (coefficient of determination) statistic - a common inferential tool used in such calibration experiments. 3. We make predictions about the R-2 statistic using our theoretical derivations and estimates from large-scale occupancy surveys of tigers in India. We then compare our predictions with empirical estimates of two tiger sign index-calibration experiments (IC-Karanth and IC-Jhala). 4. Our theoretical models show that the R-2 statistic increases when individual-specific detection probability is high and is constant, increases when the variance-to-mean ratio of abundance increases, increases when precision of abundance estimates improves and declines when mean abundance increases. All predictions about the two index-calibration experiments showed a poor performance of the R-2 statistic (R-2 ¡ 0.40). Inference from IC-Karanth was extremely poor (R-2 = 0.0004) and comparable to model predictions (P value = 0.0754). Anomalously (P value ¡ 0.0001), inference from IC-Jhala was exceedingly high (R-2 = 0.95). 5. Our study shows that such direct index-calibration experiments using the R-2 statistic yield poor inferences unless all the sampling process parameters lie within a limited range. Ignoring the consequence of the effect of these parameters during survey design could result in expenditure of huge resources with little gain in ecological inference. Analysis using joint likelihood models, with appropriate survey designs, may be more fruitful than clinging on to such composite, direct R-2-based models.},

The authors find that the ESA's process for determining whether a species is endangered or threatened is subjective and often leads to incorrect determinations. The condition of 32.6\% of listed species is declining and for 30.6\%, it is unknown. The ESA has failed to lead to the recovery of endangered or threatened species. Only two species, the Aleutian Canada goose, Brandta canadensis leucopareia, and the Virginia round-leafbirch, Betula uber, can be considered as having been reclassified from endangered to threatened primarily because of the ESA. However, in both instances, the beneficial management practices could have been conducted under other existing authorities. More than half of the species which are considered to have reached 75\% or more of their recovery objectives have reached that point for reasons other than the successful implementation of the ESA. Vertebrate species clearly receive a disproportionate share of funding. Expenditure reports reveal that expenditures by governmental agencies other than the primary implementing agencies, the USFWS and the National Marine Fisheries Service account for the majority of federal expenditures.

However, it is also considered an agricultural pest. This study aimed to identify the main environmental, human, and landscape variables influencing the European hare density, and to build density maps in the reproductive and non-reproductive seasons of 2016 and 2017 in the Pampas region. We performed spotlight counts at night and estimated its density using density surface models (DSMs). During the non-reproductive season, we found more individuals in the proximity to the Mar Chiquita Biosphere Reserve and tree plantations; and areas near towns and low accessibility (low road density). While during the reproductive season, we found significantly more European hares in heterogeneous environments, such as areas with smaller crop fields, and with higher mean productivity. In both seasons, we found a significant effect of the geographic coordinates. Based on the best models, we predicted a total abundance of 39,034 and 33,373 European hares, in the non-reproductive and reproductive season respectively. Our results revealed that disturbance by human activities and landscape configuration influenced the spatial variation of European hare density. In this study, by combining land-use changes using remote sensing products, GIS, and considering imperfect detection with distance sampling, we provided an accurate spatial European hare density estimation, which is crucial to develop integrative management programs.},

Methodological bias due to variable detectability can be critical to properly determine habitat use and, thus, for understanding species ecology, distribution, and requirements for survival. In spite of recent advances in dealing with imperfect detection through detailed modeling, this approach requires large amounts of data and usually leads to larger standard errors in parameter estimates. In this work, we explore the advantages of combining generalized linear models (GLMs) and occupancy models (OMs) for the detection of variables that may be used as indicators of habitat suitability for rodent species. As a case study, we analyzed live trapping data of three rodent species that inhabit agroecosystems at micro- and macrohabitat scales. Both methods provided complementary information: while OMs revealed that some habitat features believed to be selected by studied species actually affected detectability, some effects could only be detected by GLMs. Moreover, for some covariates apparently affecting habitat selection at both scales, comparing results between scales allowed us to determine for which it was actually relevant rather than a reflection of the other. Therefore, we advise applying complementary modeling approaches at multiple scales for habitat selection studies. A variety of outcomes and their implications are thoroughly discussed and may guide other researchers facing similar situations.},

Understanding the relative importance of known wintering sites requires estimating total number of birds using a wintering site with robust statistical methods because counts alone do not account for turnover. To study movements of common pochards (Aythya ferina) during winter (Oct to Mar) in western France, we used a combination of band-recoveries and capturerecapture data. We constructed a multi-state model to estimate monthly local survival and probability of movements between the banding site and other wintering sites, accounting for individual sex and age. We observed significant movements between sites and high population turnover even during winter. We did not detect any effect of age or sex on movement probabilities, except at the beginning of the winter when first-year individuals had a lower emigration probability. This result suggests that these inexperienced birds did not explore the wintering area like adults, at least early in the season. Combining our estimates (survival and emigration) and winter counts data, we computed the number of individuals using our study area throughout winter. This total was twice the maximum number of individuals counted in winter. Unexpectedly, low estimates for apparent survival suggest that permanent emigration occurred; although, recaptures and resightings revealed some birds traveled long distances from the capture site. We hypothesize that this permanent emigration was due to birds moving to areas where observation and hunting pressures were reduced compared to those in the French territory. If this hypothesis is true, high turnover rate would prevail not only at the scale of the wetland but also at the scale of the country. (c) The Wildlife Society, 2013},

We investigated the relation between bushmeat hunting and household wealth and protein consumption in 2 rural communities in Bioko Island, Equatorial Guinea. One village was dedicated to commercial hunting, the other trapped game primarily for food. We tested whether commercial-hunter households were nutritionally advantaged over subsistence-hunter households due to their higher income from the bushmeat trade and greater access to wild-animal protein. We conducted bushmeat-offtake surveys in both villages (captures by hunters and carcasses arriving to each village). Mammals (including threatened primates: black colobus [Colobus satanas], Preussi's guenon [Allochrocebus preussi], and russet-eared guenon [Cercopithecus erythrotis]), birds, and reptiles were hunted. The blue duiker (Philantomba monticola), giant pouched rat (Cricetomys emini), and brush-tailed porcupine (Atherurus africanus) contributed almost all the animal biomass hunted, consumed, or sold in both villages. Monkeys and Ogilbyi's duikers (Cephalophus ogilbyi) were hunted only by commercial hunters. Commercial hunters generated a mean of US\$2000/year from bushmeat sales. Households with commercial hunters were on average wealthier, generated more income, spent more money on nonessential goods, and bought more products they did not grow. By contrast, households with subsistence hunters spent less on market items, spent more on essential products, and grew more of their own food. Despite these differences, average consumption of vegetable protein and domestic meat and bushmeat protein did not differ between villages. Our results highlight the importance of understanding the socioeconomic and nutritional context of commercial and subsistence bushmeat hunting to correctly interpret ways of reducing their effects on threatened species and to enable the sustainable offtake of more productive taxa.},

  abstract = {Biodiversity-based cultural ecosystem services (CES), such as birdwatching, are strongly influenced by biotic community dynamics. However, CES models are largely static, relying on single estimates of species richness or land-use/land-cover proxies, and may be inadequate for landscape management of CES supply. Using bird survey data from the Appalachian Mountains (USA), we developed spatial-temporal models of five CES indicators (total bird species richness, and richness of migratory, infrequent, synanthrope, and resident species), reflecting variation in birdwatcher preferences. We analyzed seasonal shifts in birdwatching supply and how those shifts impacted public access to projected birdwatching hotspots. Landscape patterns of CES supply differed substantially among indicators, leading to opposing conclusions about locations of highest birdwatching supply. Total species richness hotspots seldom overlapped with hotspots of migratory or infrequent species. Public access to CES hotspots varied seasonally. Our study suggests that simple, static biodiversity metrics may overlook spatial dynamics important to CES users.},

Efforts to conserve and manage fox squirrels in the southeastern United States are constrained by difficulties in studying their populations because of low densities and low detectability. There is a need for an effective survey method to fill knowledge gaps on southeastern fox squirrel ecology. To address this need and to identify a cost-effective and reliable technique to survey and monitor southeastern fox squirrel populations, we compared four survey methods across seasons: live-trapping; camera-trapping; point counts; and line-transect surveys, in regard to whether a detection occurred at a survey point, the total number of detections at a survey point, and the total cost for each method. We assessed the effectiveness of capture and detection methods and the influence of seasonality using generalized linear mixed models. We found camera-trapping to be the most effective survey method for assessing the presence and distribution of southeastern fox squirrels. In total, camera-traps produced significantly more detections (n = 223) of fox squirrels than all other methods combined (n = 84), with most detections occurring in spring (n = 97) and the fewest in the autumn (n = 60). Furthermore, we detected fox squirrels at more survey points with camera-traps (73\%) than all other methods (63\%), and we identified 16\% more individuals from camera-trap photographs than live-trapped. We recommend future monitoring of southeastern fox squirrels to be conducted using camera-trapping during the spring unless handling of animals is needed for other research purposes.},

  abstract = {Estimating the number of waterbird colonies in a given area can have important conservation implications, including assessment of the regional or global importance of an area and the impacts of conservation efforts (e. g., habitat restoration) and human disturbance (e. g., oil spills). Our objective was to examine differences in estimates of the number of waterbird colonies determined using strip-transect (ST) surveys, distance sampling, and adaptive cluster sampling (ACS), and to compare these estimates to the minimum number of known colonies (MNKC) obtained using point-to-point surveys. We conducted aerial surveys in May 2004 and May and June 2005 at two sites in southern Louisiana: the Atchafalaya Basin (AB), a large forested wetland, and the Barataria-Terrebonne estuary (BTE), a large coastal marsh with isolated clumps of woody vegetation suitable for nesting. In AB, we detected nine and eight colonies using the ACS and ST/distance sampling methods, respectively. Neither ACS estimator of number of colonies (Horvitz-Thompson and Hansen-Hurwitz) was within the 95\% confidence interval of the estimate determined from ST; ST estimated-two to three times more colonies than either ACS estimator. The MNKC for the AB was 33, well within the 95\% confidence interval of (Y) over cap by ST sampling. For the BTE, ACS estimators ((Y) over cap (HT) = 20.49, CI = 9.3-31.7; (Y) over cap (HH) = 14.15, CI = 2.3-26.0) were similar to the MNKC (20), whereas the ST ((Y) over cap = 87.94, CI = 82.9-92.9) and distance sampling ((Y) over cap = 60, CI = 31-113) methods produced much larger estimates. Our results suggest that the ACS method performed better when waterbird colonies were spatially clumped (BTE) and the ST method performed better in areas where colonies were more uniformly distributed (AB). Depending on management objectives, a complete, systematic survey of a study area may be required if the potential for missing large colonies is unacceptable. If surveying an area with no previous information about colony location or dispersion, we recommend a coarse-scale analysis of the availability and contiguity of habitat likely to contain waterbird colonies; this analysis will help determine the most appropriate survey method.},

Sagebrush habitats have experienced dramatic declines since the 1950s, mostly due to anthropogenic disturbances. The greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) is a sagebrush-obligate species that has experienced population declines over the last several decades, which are attributed to a variety of disturbances including the more recent threat of oil and gas development. We developed a hierarchical, Bayesian state-space model to investigate the impacts of 2 measures of oil and gas development, and environmental and habitat conditions, on sage-grouse populations in Wyoming, USA using male lek counts from 1984 to 2008. Lek attendance of male sage-grouse declined by approximately 2.5\%/year and was negatively related to oil and gas well density. We found little support for the influence of sagebrush cover and precipitation on changes in lek counts. Our results support those of other studies reporting negative impacts of oil and gas development on sage-grouse populations and our modeling approach allowed us to make inference to a longer time scale and larger spatial extent than in previous studies. In addition to sage-grouse, development may also negatively affect other sagebrush-obligate species, and active management of sagebrush habitats may be necessary to maintain some species.

We used multistate mark-recapture data from eight wood frog populations in Maryland, USA, to investigate the influences of natal-pond and metamorph characteristics on post-metamorphic demographics. We found that post-metamorphic juvenile survival was highly variable and negatively influenced by abiotic conditions experienced during development but showed little relationship to larval density or size at metamorphosis. Estimates of recruitment and dispersal probabilities indicated that males mature earlier than females, and a small percentage of each sex disperse to non-natal pools. Survival probabilities for adults during the non-breeding season were less variable than juvenile rates, lower for females, and negatively related to mean monthly precipitation. Survival of adults during the breeding season was generally very high. We provide the first robust estimates of post-metamorphic vital rates of wood frogs that allow for variation in capture probabilities. We found little evidence for an effect of metamorph traits on juvenile survival, suggesting that wood frogs may be able to overcome initial disadvantages to have similar post-metamorphic performance. Our study suggests that variation in the age of maturity for wood frogs may mitigate risks associated with breeding in a highly variable habitat to maximize lifetime fitness without increasing lifespan, and this strategy is minimally affected by carry-over effects from the larval stage.},

Populations have declined in the last 150 yr primarily due to habitat loss and conversion. We conducted a 2-yr study to estimate the density and statewide abundance of breeding Long-billed Curlews in Nebraska during 2008 and 2009. Surveys were conducted during the prenesting period in April when Long-billed Curlews were likely to be detected. We used a simple random sample of roadside survey routes (N= 39), each consisting of 40 5-min point-counts at 800-m intervals. We modeled detection probability and found that wind speed negatively affected detectability, but found no evidence of either year effects or observer bias. We estimated there were 0.0038 Long-billed Curlews per hectare (0.38 Long-billed Curlews per km2) along survey routes and, by extrapolation, estimated there were 23,909 (SE = 1685; 95\% CI: 20,81027,471) Long-billed Curlews in Nebraska. Our population estimate suggests that similar to 15 to 22\% of the United States population of Long-billed Curlews is found in Nebraska. Curlews were not evenly distributed within our survey area, with the highest densities in the central Sandhills, an area dominated by grass-stabilized sand dunes and shallow wetlands, and the lowest densities in predominantly agricultural areas. Because Long-billed Curlews in Nebraska face many potential threats resulting from land-use changes, monitoring of the breeding population should be continued. Our survey method was efficient and yielded interpretable results; other states or regions should consider adopting this approach for estimating curlew abundance.},

Sightability modeling and double-observer (DO) modeling are 2 commonly used approaches to account for detection bias and to estimate precision in aerial surveys. We developed a hybrid DO sightability model (model M-H) that uses the strength of each approach to overcome the weakness in the other, for aerial surveys of elk (Cervus elaphus). The hybrid approach uses detection patterns of 2 independent observer pairs in a helicopter and telemetry-based detections of collared elk groups. Candidate M-H models reflected hypotheses about effects of recorded covariates and unmodeled heterogeneity on the separate front-seat observer pair and back-seat observer pair detection probabilities. Group size and concealing vegetation cover strongly influenced detection probabilities. The pilot's previous experience participating in aerial surveys influenced detection by the front pair of observers if the elk group was on the pilot's side of the helicopter flight path. In 9 surveys in Mount Rainier National Park, the raw number of elk counted was approximately 80-93\% of the abundance estimated by model M-H. Uncorrected ratios of bulls per 100 cows generally were low compared to estimates adjusted for detection bias, but ratios of calves per 100 cows were comparable whether based on raw survey counts or adjusted estimates. The hybrid method was an improvement over commonly used alternatives, with improved precision compared to sightability modeling and reduced bias compared to DO modeling.

We considered two simple proxies of species persistence: a time series of point-count data to calculate abundance and a time series of presence-absence data to calculate permanence (a measure of consistent occupancy over time). Using two 10-year intervals of data from the North American Breeding Bird Survey, we compared the performance of each measure at predicting persistence 18 years later. For nonrare species, abundance and permanence predicted persistence similarly well. We performed complementarity-based reserve selections with data on species abundance and permanence (from 1970 to 1979) and then evaluated the effectiveness of the reserve networks at maintaining species populations and efficiency in land use (data from 1997 to 2006). Abundance proved a better predictor of future local persistence than permanence, which justifies the relatively larger financial and temporal costs of collecting a time series of point-count data to estimate abundance. If future extinction events were used as a measure of reserve-network effectiveness, the performance of abundance and permanence did not differ markedly. Nevertheless, when future abundance, which is a more sensitive measure of network effectiveness, was used, abundance was significantly better than permanence at selecting longer-term, high-quality, species-specific habitat but required larger reserves to do so.},

  abstract = {Presence-absence data are used widely in analysis of wildlife-habitat relationships. Failure to detect a species' presence in an occupied habitat patch is a common sampling problem when the population size is small, individuals are difficult to sample, or sampling effort is limited. In this paper, the influence of non-detection of occurrence on parameter estimates of logistic regression models of wildlife-habitat relationships was assessed using analytical analysis and simulations. Two patterns of non-detection were investigated: (1) a random distribution of non-detection among occupied patches; and (2) a non-random distribution of non-detection in which the probability of detecting a species in, an occupied patch covaried with measurable habitat variables. Our results showed that logistic regression models of wildlife-habitat relationships were sensitive to even low levels of non-detection in occupancy data. Both analytic and simulation studies show that non-detection yields bias in parameter estimation of logistic regression models. More importantly, the direction of bias was affected by the underlying pattern of non-detection and whether the habitat variable was positively or negatively related to occupancy. For a positive habitat coefficient, a random distribution of non-detection yielded negative bias in estimation, whereas linkage of the probability of non-detection to habitat covariates produced positive bias. For a negative habitat coefficient, the pattern was reversed, with a random distribution of non-detection leading to positive bias in estimation. A release-recapture livetrapping study of small mammals in central Indiana, USA, was used to illustrate the magnitude of non-detection in a typical field sampling protocol with varying levels of sampling intensity. Estimates of non-detection error ranged from 0 to 23\% for seven species after 5 days of sampling. We suggest that for many sampling situations, relationships between probability of detection and habitat covariates need to be established to correctly interpret results of wildlife-habitat models.

The main target for these surveys has been the Iberian lynx, the most endangered cat in the world. The Iberian lynx conservation program has received the largest EU LIFE projects grant. So, efficiency is a key goal for managing this grant. During 2003 and 2007, we have applied these funds to the survey of the Iberian lynx in Eastern Sierra Morena (Spain). Using two different techniques, we have studied both to see which is the most efficient. The survey developed in active latrines resulted more efficient than that of scent stations and live prey camera trapping throughout the years, although there has been a variation between years. Otherwise, the live prey method has been the one providing the greatest speed and number of pictures per entrance. We suggest that camera-trapping surveys can be improved in terms of efficiency for a wide range of species, or at least for the Iberian lynx. To improve the results, cameras might be placed in relation to breeding territories. With this determinant, camera-trapping surveys would be shorter than 120 days. Finally, we suggest how those surveys for medium carnivores should be designed.},

Using data from a population of the torrent frog, Hylodes asper, we calculate return rates and compare them with survival probability estimates adjusted for detection probability to highlight the discrepancies between the two metrics. Then, using power analysis, we also explore how survival is underestimated, considering different scenarios and sampling efforts, given low detectability. Finally, we provide information on the optimal number of surveys to achieve a reasonable precision, assuming a fixed number of individuals initially captured for a series of parameter values. Ignoring potential bias of uncorrected estimates may lead to weak inference and erroneous decisions for management and conservation.

Bird species richness and the relative abundance or probability of occurrence of many species were significantly associated with total length of roads within each of two spatial extents (1- and 2-km radii), distance to the nearest road, distance to the nearest development, or the two-way interactions of these variables. Regression models reflected non-linear relations, interaction effects, spatial-extent effects, and interannual variation. Road and development effects warrant special attention in protected areas because such places may be important sources of indigenous bird communities in a region. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.},

  abstract = {A new technique to estimate the characteristic length scales (CLSs) of real ecological systems provides an objective means to identify the optimal scale(s) of observation to best detect underlying dynamical trends. Application of the technique to natural systems has focused on identifying appropriate scales to measure the dynamics of species as descriptors of community and ecosystem dynamics. However, ecosystem monitoring is often based not on assessing single species, but on species assemblages, functional groups, or habitat types. We asked whether the concept of CLSs based on dynamic interactions among species could be extended to examine interactions among habitat types and thus to identify optimal scales for observing habitat dynamics. A time series of three spatial maps of benthic habitats on a Caribbean coral reef was constructed from aerial photographs, Compact Airborne Spectrographic Imager (CASI) images, and IKONOS satellite images, providing the short time sequence required for this technique. We estimated the CLS based on the dynamics of three distinct habitat types: dense stands of seagrass, sparse stands of seagrass, and Montastrea patch reefs. Despite notable differences in the areal extent of and relative change in these habitats over the 21-year observation period, analyses based on each habitat type indicated a similar CLS of similar to 300 m. We interpret the consistency of CLSs among habitats to indicate that the dynamics of the three habitat types are linked. The results are encouraging, and they indicate that CLS techniques can be used to identify the appropriate scale at which to monitor ecosystem trends on the basis of the dynamics of only one of a disparate suite of habitat types.},

The story is one of major paradigmatic shifts with implications for the design and operation of similar programs worldwide. Since 1983, Australian Governments have approved the National Soil Conservation Program, the National Landcare Program, the Natural Heritage Trust, the National Action Plan for Salinity and Water Quality and a new program called Caring for Our Country. These programs have seen a transition from the early days of attitude change to the creation of new regional institutions and direct payment systems for environmental stewardship. Despite these advances recent audit reports have mirrored those from the United States and the Europe. They identify problems of ineffective targeting, monitoring and evaluation of expenditure. This paper considers the efficiency and effectiveness of alternative program designs in Australia. Two major design improvements are suggested: (a) systems for linking expenditure to outcomes and (b) adopting standardised metrics for valuing outcomes. This will permit the application of benefit-cost and cost-effectiveness analysis and, ultimately, improved returns on investment. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Practical conservation of biological diversity is dependent on reliable knowledge about what kind, how much, and where the diversity is. To obtain such knowledge three questions, why, what, and how, must be answered before commencing any biodiversity survey. While the questions why and what are often value decisions and thus determined outside the realm of scientific research, the question about how the surveys are conducted lies in the heart of science. Here, we report an intensive repeated survey of wood-inhabiting fungi with the aim of determining the optimal timing and number of the surveys for reliable estimation of the diversity of this species group. The research focusing on the ecology of wood-inhabiting fungi has been increasing but little is known about the reliability of the methods. The variation in the estimates of diversity among surveys was high and the results varied between studied species groups. The site-scale detectability for species belonging to different groups varied from 10 to 95\% depending on the survey month and the species group. We conclude that because detectability of many fungi turned out to be poor even when surveys were conducted at an optimal time, the common practice of using a single fruit body survey to estimate fungal diversity of any given area is not enough. We suggest that multiple surveys at an optimal time should be a norm in fungal diversity studies. Improper methodology results in unreliable outcomes that have potential to hamper our goal of conserving the biological diversity.},

This lack of knowledge may disproportionately affect butterflies in the USA, which form the largest group of federally protected insects (20 of 62 species). 2. The Mitchell's satyr butterfly, Neonympha mitchellii mitchellii, is a federally endangered species found at 18 highly isolated sites in the Eastern USA. Currently, surveys are conducted by meandering through habitat and recording the number of butterflies observed. These surveys are efficient in terms of staffing and time, but the data from these surveys cannot be used to estimate abundance. Mark release recapture surveys generate estimates of demographic parameters and have been conducted, albeit infrequently, and require high staffing levels and weeks of fieldwork to generate estimates with reasonable error. 3. I employed hierarchical distance sampling along line transects to estimate N. m. mitchellii abundance at one site in lower Michigan, USA. This method requires one observer to traverse a series of transects at a walking pace and record the number of butterflies observed and their perpendicular distance to the transect line. My results suggest that this method is as cost efficient as meander surveys, but generates reasonable estimates of butterfly abundance.},

  abstract = {Accurate estimates of survival are crucial for many management decisions in translocation programs. Maximizing detection probabilities and reducing sampling biases for released animals can aid in estimates of survival. One important source of sampling bias is an animal's behavior. For example, individuals that are consistently more exploratory or active may be more likely to be detected visually. Behavioral traits can be related to survival after reintroduction, and because many pre-release treatments aim to manipulate animal behavior, it is critical to tease apart relationships between behavior and detection probability. Here, we assessed the repeatability (intra-individual consistency and inter-individual variation) of behavioral traits for an endangered amphibian, the mountain yellow-legged frog (Rana muscosa). Because new technological tools offer one potential solution for reducing sampling biases while increasing detection, we also tested whether a long-range passive integrated transponder (PIT) tag reader could enhance surveys for these individuals after translocation into the wild. After confirming thatex situbredR. muscosaexhibit repeatable behavioral traits (repeatability = 0.25-0.41) and releasing these frogs (N = 196) into the wild, we conducted post-release surveys visually and with the long-range PIT tag reader. Integrating the long-range reader into surveys improved detection probability four-fold in comparison to visual surveys alone (similar to 0.09 to similar to 0.36). Moreover, mark-recapture modeling revealed that tag reader detection probability was not biased toward detecting individuals of specific behavioral types, while visual detection was significantly related to behavioral traits. These results will enable a more accurate understanding of individual differences in post-release success in translocations. This may be particularly important for amphibian species, which can be difficult to detect and are expected to increasingly be involved in human-managed breeding and translocation programs due to their vulnerable conservation status.},

  abstract = {Motivated by the need to estimate the abundance of marine mammal populations to inform conservation assessments, especially relating to fishery bycatch, this paper provides background on abundance estimation and reviews the various methods available for pinnipeds, cetaceans and sirenians. We first give an "entry-level" introduction to abundance estimation, including fundamental concepts and the importance of recognizing sources of bias and obtaining a measure of precision. Each of the primary methods available to estimate abundance of marine mammals is then described, including data collection and analysis, common challenges in implementation, and the assumptions made, violation of which can lead to bias. The main method for estimating pinniped abundance is extrapolation of counts of animals (pups or all-ages) on land or ice to the whole population. Cetacean and sirenian abundance is primarily estimated from transect surveys conducted from ships, small boats or aircraft. If individuals of a species can be recognized from natural markings, mark-recapture analysis of photo-identification data can be used to estimate the number of animals using the study area. Throughout, we cite example studies that illustrate the methods described. To estimate the abundance of a marine mammal population, key issues include: defining the population to be estimated, considering candidate methods based on strengths and weaknesses in relation to a range of logistical and practical issues, being aware of the resources required to collect and analyze the data, and understanding the assumptions made. We conclude with a discussion of some practical issues, given the various challenges that arise during implementation.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Passerines dominated the avifauna numerically, comprising 97\% of individuals surveyed but less than half of the 115 species recorded in the Preserve. We used distance-sampling and discrete-removal models to estimate detection probabilities, densities, and population sizes across the Preserve for 23 species of migrant passerines and five species of resident passerines. Yellow-rumped Warblers (Dendroica coronata) and Dark-eyed Juncos (Junco hyemalis) were the most abundant species, together accounting for 41\% of the migrant passerine populations estimated. White-winged Crossbills (Loxia leucoptera), Boreal Chickadees (Poecile hudsonica), and Gray Jays (Perisoreus canadensis) were the most abundant residents. Species richness was greatest in the Floodplain/Terrace landform flanking the Yukon River but densities were highest in the Subalpine landform. Species composition was related to past glacial history and current physiography of the region and differed notably from other areas of the northwestern boreal forest. Point-transect surveys, augmented with auxiliary observations, were well suited to sampling the largely passerine avifauna across this rugged landscape and could be used across the boreal forest region to monitor changes in northern bird distribution and abundance.},

Climate change could therefore result in species range dynamics that reduce the relevance of current fixed protected areas in future conservation strategies. Here, we apply species distribution modeling and conservation planning tools in three regions (Mexico, the Cape Floristic Region of South Africa, and Western Europe) to examine the need for additional protected areas in light of anticipated species range shifts caused by climate change. We set species representation targets and assessed the area required to meet those targets in the present and in the future, under a moderate climate change scenario. Our findings indicate that protected areas can be an important conservation strategy in such a scenario, and that early action may be both more effective and less costly than inaction or delayed action. According to our projections, costs may vary among regions and none of the three areas studied will fully meet all conservation targets, even under a moderate climate change scenario. This suggests that limiting climate change is an essential complement to adding protected areas for conservation of biodiversity.}

As part of an investigation into the species’ ecology in lowland swamp forest, surveys were undertaken to establish the possum’s distribution and abundance at Yellingbo. The population is estimated to contain 80 - 100 individuals, distributed along a narrow, 6 km length of riparian forest. Most of the suitable foraging habitat is presently occupied, and densities are similar to those previously reported for the species in montane ash forest. The possums are breeding year round, with significant recruitment of young into the population, and data obtained between 1995-2004 suggest that the population size is currently stable. A highly targeted revegetation program focused on the floodplain has the potential to improve up to 85 ha of degraded swamp forest, and in so doing would more than double the area of suitable habitat for G. leadbeateri in the reserve.},

An important consideration when designing studies using point counts is to maximize detection probability while minimizing variation in detection probability both within and between counts. Our objectives were to estimate detection probabilities for three marsh songbirds, including Marsh Wrens (Cistothorus palustris), Swamp Sparrows (Melospiza georgiana), and w Yellow-headed Blackbirds (Xanthocephalus xanthocephalus), as a function of wearher covariates and to evaluate temporal variability in detection probability of these three species. We conducted paired, unlimited radius, 10min point counts during consecutive morning and evening survey periods for our three focal species at 56 wetlands in Iowa from 20 April to 10 July 2010. Mean detection probabilities ranged from 0.272 (SE = 0.042) for Marsh Wrens to 0.365 (SE = 0.052) for Swamp Sparrows. Time of season was positively correlated with detection probability for Swamp Sparrows, but was negatively correlated with detection probability for Yellow-headed Blackbirds, suggesting that detection probability increased during the breeding season for Swamp Sparrows and was highest early in the breeding season for Yellow-headed Blackbirds. Understanding how detection probabilities of marsh songbirds vary throughout the breeding season allows targeted survey efforts that maximize detection probabilities for these species. Furthermore, consistent detection probabilities of marsh songbirds during morning and evening survey periods mean that investigators have more time to conduct surveys for rhese birds, allowing greater flexibility to increase spatial and temporal replication of surveys that could provide more precise estimates of desired population parameters.},

  abstract = {Development of a standard monitoring protocol for assessing the impacts of REDD+ (Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation) projects on biodiversity is desirable. Drawing on the conservation literature and our personal experience, we review whether such a one-size-fits-all approach is justifiable on scientific and practical grounds. We conclude that achieving a model biodiversity monitoring protocol suitable for use in all potential REDD+ sites is probably an unrealistic objective, owing to the huge differences among the world's forests in terms of structure, species composition, ecological interactions and ecosystem services provided. Moreover, to provide useful feedback for conservation managers, ecological monitoring programmes must be designed around a project's conservation goals, which will vary from project to project, owing to these differences in forest ecology and human threats faced. Thus, site-specific biodiversity monitoring programmes are needed. No single monitoring method is likely to be optimal, or even suitable for use, in all REDD+ forests. Instead, we suggest that a standard approach be adopted, in which ecological monitoring research is (i) designed to reflect a project's biodiversity conservation goals; (ii) based upon scientifically-tractable, policy-relevant questions regarding the impacts of management interventions on the ecosystem; (iii) founded on detailed knowledge of the habitat type in question; (iv) includes monitoring of a number of indicators, as appropriate to the project; and (v) defines appropriate reference/baseline conditions against which progress can be assessed.},

  abstract = {Mismatches in boundaries between natural ecosystems and land governance units often complicate an ecosystem approach to management and conservation. For example, information used to guide management, such as vegetation maps, may not be available or consistent across entire ecosystems. This study was undertaken within a single biogeographic region (the Murray Mallee) spanning three Australian states. Existing vegetation maps could not be used as vegetation classifications differed between states. Our aim was to describe and map ‘tree mallee’ vegetation consistently across a 104 000 km2 area of this region. Hierarchical cluster analyses, incorporating floristic data from 713 sites, were employed to identify distinct vegetation types. Neural network classification models were used to map these vegetation types across the region, with additional data from 634 validation sites providing a measure of map accuracy. Four distinct vegetation types were recognised: Triodia Mallee, Heathy Mallee, Chenopod Mallee and Shrubby Mallee. Neural network models predicted the occurrence of three of them with 79\% accuracy. Validation results identified that map accuracy was 67\% (kappa = 0.42) when using independent data. The framework employed provides a simple approach to describing and mapping vegetation consistently across broad spatial extents. Specific outcomes include: (1) a system of vegetation classification suitable for use across this biogeographic region; (2) a consistent vegetation map to inform land-use planning and biodiversity management at local and regional scales; and (3) a quantification of map accuracy using independent data. This approach is applicable to other regions facing similar challenges associated with integrating vegetation data across jurisdictional boundaries.},

  abstract = {Tree hollows are a critical, yet potentially limiting habitat resource for many animal species. Fire influences hollow availability, and the associated indirect effects on fauna can threaten the persistence of hollow-dependent species in fire-prone systems. We investigated the influence of two temporal aspects of fire regimes (time-since-fire, inter-fire interval) on hollow occurrence in a semi-arid, fire-prone region in south-eastern Australia. Empirical data on the characteristics of hollow-bearing eucalypt stems and fire-history attributes were compiled for 581 study sites. Mixed models were used to examine the relative influence of time-since-fire and inter-fire interval on hollow occurrence. Time-since-fire and interfire interval both affected the probability of hollow occurrence, but in different ways. Time-since-fire influenced the occurrence of hollows in live and dead stems. As time-since-fire increased, so too did the probability of live and dead stems containing hollows. Live stems did not provide hollows before 40 years post-fire, while the probability of dead stems containing hollows peaked at 50–60 years. Inter-fire interval influenced the availability of hollows in dead stems. Longer inter-fire intervals resulted in an increased density of dead hollow-bearing stems. In this region, hollow-dependent fauna will benefit from increased fire-free periods, both in terms of individual fire events and the intervals between repeated fires. These results highlight the complex way in which fire affects the availability of faunal habitat resources, and the extended time periods over which such influences operate. Understanding the effects of fire regimes on slow-developing habitat resources over long time-frames is imperative for sound ecological fire management.},

Relative abundances of the White-throated Ground-Dove, Mariana Fruit-Dove, Collared Kingfisher, Micronesian Starling, and Micronesian Myzomela all increased during the study period. Abundances of the Golden White-eye and Rufous Fantail followed a curvilinear trend that increased during the first half of the survey period (1991-2000) and decreased in the second half (2001-2010). Abundances of the remaining species (Island Collared-Dove, Bridled White-eye, Nightingale Reed-Warbler, and Eurasian Tree Sparrow) showed no significant trends. The most numerous species (over 40 individuals detected per survey), in decreasing order of abundance, were the Bridled Whiteeye, Rufous Fantail, Golden White-eye, Micronesian Starling, and Micronesian Myzomela. The total abundance of birds increased on average by 0.27 birds per year, per survey station, island-wide. Three stations out of 47 (6.4\%) recorded a significant loss of total birds over the time period, and bird numbers increased significantly at only one station (2.1\%). Stations at which we detected declines were clustered in the northern, less-populated, region of Saipan. We explored the relationship between typhoon frequency/severity and bird abundance to explain trend patterns but found no significant correlation. We suggest ways to improve roadside surveys as a management tool to aid in detecting avian declines that are of conservation concern.},

Biodiversity or economic value, and the ease of detection and control are also likely to vary. We incorporate these factors into a detection and treatment model of a low-density invader to determine the surveillance strategy that minimizes expected management costs. Sites with a high probability of invader occurrence and great benefits associated with detection warrant intensive surveillance; however, the optimum investment is a nonlinear function of these factors. Environments where the invader is relatively easy to detect are prioritized for surveillance, although only a moderate investment is necessary to ensure a high probability of detection. Intensive surveillance effort may be allocated to other sites if the probability of occurrence, budget and ⁄ or expected benefits is sufficiently high.},

  abstract = {Density is a key trait of populations and an essential parameter in ecological research, wildlife conservation and management. Several models have been developed to estimate population density based on camera trapping data, including the random encounter model (REM) and camera trap distance sampling (CTDS). Both models need to account for variation in animal behavior that depends, for example, on the species and sex of the animals along with temporally varying environmental factors. We examined whether the density estimates of REM and CTDS can be improved for Europe's most numerous deer species, by adjusting the behavior-related model parameters per species and accounting for differences in movement speeds between sexes, seasons, and years. Our results showed that bias through inadequate consideration of animal behavior was exceeded by the uncertainty of the density estimates, which was mainly influenced by variation in the number of independent observations between camera trap locations. The neglection of seasonal and annual differences in movement speed estimates for REM overestimated densities of red deer in autumn and spring by ca. 14\%. This GPS telemetry-derived parameter was found to be most problematic for roe deer females in summer and spring when movement behavior was characterized by small-scale displacements relative to the intervals of the GPS fixes. In CTDS, density estimates of red deer improved foremost through the consideration of behavioral reactions to the camera traps (avoiding bias of max. 19\%), while species-specific delays between photos had a larger effect for roe deer. In general, the applicability of both REM and CTDS would profit profoundly from improvements in their precision along with the reduction in bias achieved by exploiting the available information on animal behavior in the camera trap data.},

For many rare butterflies, these estimates do not exist, and conservation decisions rely instead on expert opinion. Using Bartram's scrub-hairstreak (Strymon acis bartrami, US Endangered) as a case study, we present a novel comparison of two methods that permit the incorporation of detection probabilities into abundance estimates, distance sampling and double-observer surveys. Additionally we provide a framework for establishing a systematic sampling scheme for monitoring very rare butterflies. We surveyed butterflies monthly in 2013, increasing intensity to weekly when butterflies were detected. We conducted 19 complete, island-wide surveys on Big Pine Key in the Florida Keys, detecting a total of 59 Bartram's scrub-hairstreaks across all surveys. Peak daily abundances were similar as estimated with distance sampling, 156 butterflies (95 \% CI 65-247), and double-observer, 169 butterflies (95 \% CI 65-269). Selecting a method for estimating abundance of rare species involves evaluating trade-offs between methods. Distance sampling requires at least 40 detections, but only one observer, while double-observer requires only 10 detections, but two observers. Double-observer abundance estimates agreed with distance sampling estimates, which suggests that double-observer is a reasonable alternative method to use for estimating detection probability and abundance for rare species that cannot be surveyed with other, more commonly used methods.},

Not all rare species occupy habitats that are easy to see across and navigate, in which cases a new approach to monitoring is necessary. We present a novel use of point transect distance sampling to monitor the Miami blue, a highly endangered butterfly that occupies dense shrub habitat. To monitor Miami blue density, we developed surveys consisting of butterfly counts in semi-circular plots. We examined the rate at which an observer detects new butterflies to determine the survey duration that meets the key assumption that butterflies are detected at their initial location. As a related secondary goal, we identified the determinants of adult flight phenology to target monitoring efforts during periods of high adult abundance. We observed peak Miami blue densities in April and July/August 2012, and July/August 2013. We estimated density using detections from a 10-sec survey, our most defensible and conservative estimate. Peak daily density estimates ranged from 592 to 680 butterflies per hectare. Adult density was related to precipitation patterns, with high densities occurring 4-6 weeks after particularly wet 4-week intervals. For butterfly species that exist in high enough densities, we recommend using point transect distance sampling in habitats where traditional methods are impossible to implement.},

But for peripheral populations, where individuals may occur in patchy, low-density populations, precise estimation of population size and trend remains logistically and statistically challenging. For moose (Alces alces) along their southern range margin in northern New York, USA, we sought robust estimates of moose distribution, abundance, and population trend (2016–2019) using a combination of aerial surveys (line transect distance-sampling), repeated surveys in areas where moose were known to occur to boost the number of detections, and density surface modeling (DSM) with spatial covariates. We achieved a precise estimate of density (95\% CI = 0.00–0.29 moose/km2) for this small population (656 moose, 95\% CI = 501–859), which was patchily distributed across a large and heavily forested region (the 24,280-km2 Adirondack Park). Local moose abundance was positively related to active timber management, elevation, and snow cover, and negatively related to large bodies of water. As expected, moose abundance in this peripheral population was low relative to its core range in other northern forest states. Yet, in areas where abundance was greatest, moose densities in New York approached those where epizootics of winter tick (Dermacentor albipictus) have been reported, underscoring the need for effective and efficient monitoring. By incorporating autocorrelation in observations and landscape covariates, DSM provided spatially explicit estimates of moose density with greater precision and no additional field effort over traditional distance sampling. Combined with repeated surveys of areas with known moose occurrence to achieve viable sample sizes, DSM is a useful tool for effectively monitoring low density and patchy populations.},

  abstract = {Artificial retreats area a low-cost, low-impact and effective technique for detecting cryptic taxa, such as hepetofauna, and have potential as a monitoring tool. The success of using artificial retreats for monitoring is dependent on our ability to maximise detection and minimise variability in sightings within a sampling period. Because ectotherms use retreats for their thermal properties, it may be possible to identify weather conditions during which animals consistently use retreats and design a monitoring protocol based on optimal conditions. We investigated the use of artificial retreats by common skinks. Oligosoma polychroma, in mixed grassland habitat in southern New Zealand under various weather conditions and at a range of times of day. We recorded 1175 sightings of skinks during 1800 artificial retreat checks over a nine day period in early summer 2008. Ambient temperature, rainfall, humidity and time of day were the strongest predictors of skink sightings beneath retreats. Skink sightings were highest and least variable: (1) in an ambient temperature range of 12-18 degrees C, (2) during light or no rain, and (3) at low levels of relative humidity. Under optimal weather conditions, skink counts were similar during the day (8 a.m. to 5 p.m. inclusive) but lower during the evening (8 p.m.). Observer variability, type of substrate beneath the retreat and retreat colour did not significantly influence the number of skinks sighted. We highlight the need to optimise protocols for checking artificial retreats on a species- and site-specific basis before attempting to evaluate their use as a monitoring tool for herpetofauna.

  abstract = {Context Fertility control is seen as an attractive alternative to lethal methods for control of population size and genetic diversity in managed animal populations. Immunocontraceptive vaccines have emerged as the most promising agents for inducing long-term infertility in individual animals. However, after over 20 years of scientific testing of immunocontraceptive vaccines in the horse, the scientific consensus is that their application as a sole management approach for reducing population size is not an effective strategy. Aims The purpose of this review is to evaluate currently available non-lethal fertility-control methods that have been tested for their contraceptive efficacy in Equidae, and to assess their suitability for effective management of wild (feral) horses in an Australian setting. Key results (1) Fertility-control agents, particularly injectable immunocontraceptive vaccines based on porcine zona pellucida (PZP) or gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH), can induce multi-year infertility (up to 3 years) in the horse. Some formulations require annual or biennial booster treatments. Remote dart delivery (on foot) to horses is possible, although the efficacy of this approach when applied to large numbers of animals is yet to be determined. (2) The proportion of females that must be treated with a fertility-control agent, as well as the frequency of treatment required to achieve defined management outcomes (i.e. halting population growth in the short term and reducing population size in the long term) is likely to be {$>$}50\% per annum. In national parks, treatment of a large number of wild horses over such a broad area would be challenging and impractical. (3) Fertility control for wild horses could be beneficial, but only if employed in conjunction with other broad-scale population-control practices to achieve population reduction and to minimise environmental impacts. Conclusions In Australia, most populations of wild horses are large, dispersed over varied and difficult-to-access terrain, are timid to approach and open to immigration and introductions. These factors make accessing and effectively managing animals logistically difficult. If application of fertility control could be achieved in more than 50\% of the females, it could be used to slow the rate of increase in a population to zero (2–5 years), but it will take more than 10–20 years before population size will begin to decline without further intervention. Thus, use of fertility control as the sole technique for halting population growth is not feasible in Australia.},

Several different survey methods are available, and the choice of method depends on the species and study aims. Few studies have compared the accuracy and efficiency of different survey methods for large mammals, particularly for primates. Here we compare estimates of density and abundance of Kloss' gibbons (Hylobates klossii) using two of the most common survey methods: line transect distance sampling and triangulation. Line transect surveys (survey effort: 155.5 km) produced a total of 101 auditory and visual encounters and a density estimate of 5.5 gibbon clusters (groups or subgroups of primate social units)/km(2). Triangulation conducted from 12 listening posts during the same period revealed a similar density estimate of 5.0 clusters/km(2). Coefficients of variation of cluster density estimates were slightly higher from triangulation (0.24) than from line transects (0.17), resulting in a lack of precision in detecting changes in cluster densities of {$<$} 66 \% for triangulation and {$<$} 47 \% for line transect surveys at the 5 \% significance level with a statistical power of 50 \%. This case study shows that both methods may provide estimates with similar accuracy but that line transects can result in more precise estimates and allow assessment of other primate species. For a rapid assessment of gibbon density under time and financial constraints, the triangulation method also may be appropriate.},

Here, we present 4 case studies from protected areas with Amur tigers (Panthera tigris altaica) in Russia, in which indicators of success were defined and evaluated at each. The ultimate goal was an increase in tiger numbers to 1 individual/100 km(2) at each site. We predicted that improvements in law enforcement effectiveness would be followed by increases in prey numbers and, subsequently, tiger numbers. We used short-term and long-term indicators of success, including: (i) patrol team effort and effectiveness; (ii) catch per unit effort indicators (to measure reductions in threats); and (iii) changes in target species numbers. In addition to implementing a monitoring system, we focused on improving law enforcement management using an adaptive management process. Over 4 years, we noted clear increases in patrol effort and a partial reduction in threats. Although we did not detect clear trends in ungulate numbers, tiger populations remained stable or increased, suggesting that poaching of tigers may be more limiting than prey depletion. Increased effectiveness is needed before a clear reduction in threats can be noted, and more time is needed before detecting responses in target populations. Nonetheless, delineation of concrete goals and indicators of success provide a means of evaluating progress and weaknesses. Such monitoring should be a central component of law enforcement strategies for protected areas.},

  abstract = {The bush cricket Saga pedo is a critically endangered species in the EU and is included in Annex IV of Council Directive 92/43/EEC. This species is therefore subject to mandatory regular monitoring within all member countries where it occurs. Because its abundance is low and little information is available concerning its ecology, however, an effective monitoring method that would yield standardized results has yet to be devised. We found S. pedo passing through 6 instars during its development in Central European conditions. Our findings indicate that, after hatching, S. pedo moves constantly through terrain with optimal vegetation and thereby reduces its population density. Based on recaptures of marked individuals, adults moved usually between 0.5 and 2 m in 24 h, the largest distance moved during a day was recorded as 37.5 m. Combined with a high mortality rate, this continual movement leads to very low density late in the season. Based on extensive surveys conducted during 2006-2011 at 10 sites in the Palava Protected Landscape Area (Czech Republic), we show that the optimal time for monitoring in order to achieve comparable results from different investigators in different locations is the period just after nymphs hatch (1-10 May in Central Europe). Because S. pedo populations in Europe are threatened by habitat destruction resulting from successional overgrowth of habitat by vegetation and afforestation, ensuring the survival of this species will require that successional changes in vegetation and afforestation be stopped by mowing and removal of woody plants and seedlings or by farming (extensive grazing). Management need not be performed every year but should occur when the S. pedo population is already adult and dispersed. The most suitable period for partial machine mowing (1/3-1/2 of a specific area) is September. Mowing with scythes and extensive rotational grazing are the best methods for managing sites where S. pedo is found.},

  abstract = {A ground-based scanning lidar (light detection and ranging) system was evaluated to assess its potential utility for tree-level forest mensuration data extraction. Ground-based-lidar and field-mensuration data were collected for two forest plots: one located within a red pine (Pinus resinosa Ait.) plantation and another in a mixed deciduous stand dominated by sugar maple (Acer saccharum Marsh.). Five lidar point cloud scans were collected from different vantage points for each plot over a 6-h period on 5 July 2002 using an Optech Inc. ILRIS-3D laser imager. Fieldvalidation data were collected manually over several days during the same time period. Parameters that were measured in the field or derived from manual field measures included (i) stem location, (ii) tree height, (iii) stem diameter at breast height (DBH), (iv) stem density, and (v) timber volume. These measures were then compared with those derived from the ILRIS-3D data (i.e., the lidar point cloud data). It was found that all parameters could be measured or derived from the data collected by the ground-based lidar system. There was a slight systematic underestimation of mean tree height resulting from canopy shadow effects and suboptimal scan sampling distribution. Timber volume estimates for both plots were within 7\% of manually derived estimates. Tree height and DBH parameters have the potential for objective measurement or derivation with little manual intervention. However, locating and counting trees within the lidar point cloud, particularly in the multitiered deciduous plot, required the assistance of field-validation data and some subjective interpretation. Overall, ground-based lidar demonstrates promise for objective and consistent forest metric assessment, but work is needed to refine and develop automatic feature identification and data extraction techniques.},

Three wildlife sanctuaries of the Bangladesh Sundarbans are typical examples of protected areas where detection and monitoring of threats is difficult due to low densities of patrol staff and low frequency of patrolling relative to the area that requires monitoring. The aim of this study was to use camera traps to quantify: 1) the levels of different types of illegal human activities (IHA), 2) spatio-temporal variation in illegal human activities, and 3) what proportion of camera trap records can be used to identify perpetrators. Each photograph was categorized as either illegal human activity (IHA) or legal human activity (LHA) based on interpretation of the particular human activity and equipment observed in photograph. For IHA, infraction type was based on the Bangladesh Wildlife (Conservation and Security) Act 2012. A total of 914 unique human activity events were recorded (872 IHA and 42 LHA) in camera trap photos over a total of 1039 trap nights. The best model suggests that during spring tide 91\% of camera trapped locations in the West Sanctuary had IHA occurring in them during the survey period, while 84\% and 74\% locations had IHA in the South Sanctuary and East Sanctuary respectively. Camera trapping in remote areas can potentially help protected area managers to increase rates of detection of IHA in their conservation landscapes and increase rates of arrests and prosecutions by providing appropriate supporting evidence.

Rarely are all individuals detected during a survey and abundance models often incorporate some form of imperfect detection. Detection probability, however, consists of three components: probability of presence during a survey, probability of availability given presence, and probability of detection given availability and presence. We develop an integrated model to separate these three detection components and provide abundance estimates for the available, present, and superpopulation of individuals. Our framework integrates several common survey methods for unmarked populations: spatially and temporally replicated counts, distance sampling data, and time-of-detection data. Simulations indicated relatively unbiased estimates for detection and availability probabilities. Negative bias in estimated superpopulation abundance was present with three temporally replicated surveys, but greatly reduced with six surveys. In a case study of Island Scrub-Jays (Aphelocoma insularis), posterior modes for presence, availability, and detection probabilities were 0.78, 0.96, and 0.26, respectively, from 10-min point counts repeated at 97 sites on three occasions, with noticeable differences among available, present, and superpopulation abundance estimates. This generalizable framework integrates common sampling protocols and provides joint inferences on the components of detection probability, spatial and non-spatial temporary emigration, and abundance in unmarked populations.},

  abstract = {Distance sampling is a common and increasingly used method of estimating animal abundance in conservation and management programmes. The precision of a distance sampling survey can be estimated from the field data, but accuracy can only be evaluated by comparison with the true population size. For wild mammal populations, such opportunities are rare. The high-density badger Meles meles population at Woodchester Park in Gloucestershire, U.K. has been routinely and intensively live-trapped for the past 30 years. The estimates of abundance based on mark-recapture analyses of the live-trapping data provided a reliable baseline against which to evaluate distance sampling for a badger population. A distance sampling survey was carried out in autumn 2002 by using spotlighting along line transects. Owing to the impractical nature of spotlighting in closed habitats, such as woodland, surveys were conducted in open habitat only. A radio-tracking study provided behavioural data that were used to estimate the proportion of the population available for sampling in open habitats. This was incorporated as a multiplier into the DISTANCE analysis. The estimate of abundance from distance sampling was 76 badgers (\% CV = 42.2), using a multiplier based on radio-tracking data from autumn only. When the multiplier was derived from radio-tracking data from across the whole year, based on a larger sample of tracked badgers, the distance sampling abundance estimate was 77 badgers (\% CV = 25.9). These compared favourably to the mark-recapture estimate of 68 badgers (\% C.V = 7.4). The lack of precision in the distance sampling density estimate was largely owing to the inclusion of the multiplier. Distance sampling combined with data on habitat use can produce reliable estimates of badger abundance in areas of medium to high density, particularly in landscapes of primarily open habitat.},

There were significant positive correlations between monitoring methods, but the strength of these relationships varied for Acadian Flycatchers (Empidonax virescens), Ovenbirds (Seiurus aurocapilla), Worm-eating Warblers (Helmitheros vermivorus), and Wood Thrushes (Hylocichla mustelina). There was significant bias associated with the point-count detections for Acadian Flycatchers. Worm-eating Warblers, and Wood Thrushes. The direction and degree of bias varied; for example, Acadian Flycatchers and Worm-eating Warblers were on average significantly overestimated by point Counts, whereas the Wood Thrush was significantly Underestimated and Ovenbirds were Slightly Underestimated. The magnitude and direction of the bias error varied with spot-map density estimates of the species, but was not related to specific study sites Or years. Thus 50-m radius fixed-radius point Counts appear to reflect general density trends for the four species, especially for Ovenbirds, but there are also density related biases associated with point-count detections.},

  abstract = {Science-based management strategies are needed to halt or reverse the global decline of amphibians. In many cases, sound management requires reliable models built using monitoring data. Historically, monitoring and statistical modeling efforts have focused on estimating occupancy using detection-nondetection data. Spatial occupancy models are useful for studying colonization-extinction dynamics, but richer insights can be gained from estimating abundance and density-dependent demographic rates. We developed an integrated abundance-based metapopulation model of the processes contributing to spatiotemporal variation in patch population density. We fit our model to a combination of detection-nondetection and count data from a 14-yr study of a reintroduced metapopulation of federally threatened Chiricahua Leopard Frogs (Lit hobates chiricahuensis). Pond-specific population growth rate was influenced by pond hydroperiod and frog density, such that permanent and semipermanent ponds with low densities of adult frogs experienced the highest annual population growth rates. Immigration rate declined as the distance among ponds increased. After reintroduction in 2003, metapopulation-level abundance increased and appeared to stabilize around 1300 adult frogs (95\% CI = 1192-1471) by year 2015. Further, changes in metapopulation abundance were driven mostly by changes in abundance at a few ponds. These high-density populations, which would not have been identifiable with traditional occupancy-based metapopulation models, are likely especially important for species recovery in the area. Abundance-based metapopulation models can be widely applied to inform conservation efforts, by providing higher quality information needed to prioritize habitat patches for management and can be used to make more accurate predictions of metapopulation extinction risk.},

  abstract = {Biologists have repeatedly rediscovered classical models from physics predicting collision rates in an ideal gas. These models, and their two-dimensional analogues, have been used to predict rates and durations of encounters among animals or social groups that move randomly and independently, given population density, velocity, and distance at which an encounter occurs. They have helped to separate cases of mixed-species association based on behavioural attraction from those that simply reflect high population densities, and to detect cases of attraction or avoidance among conspecifics. They have been used to estimate the impact of population density, speeds of movement and size on rates of encounter between members of the opposite sex, between gametes, between predators and prey, and between observers and the individuals that they are counting. One limitation of published models has been that they predict rates of encounter, but give no means of determining whether observations differ significantly from predictions. Another uncertainty is the robustness of the predictions when animal movements deviate from the model’s assumptions in specific, biologically relevant ways. Here, we review applications of the ideal gas model, derive extensions of the model to cover some more realistic movement patterns, correct several errors that have arisen in the literature, and show how to generate confidence limits for expected rates of encounter among independently moving individuals. We illustrate these results using data from mangabey monkeys originally used along with the ideal gas model to argue that groups avoid each other. Although agent-based simulations provide a more flexible alternative approach, the ideal gas model remains both a valuable null model and a useful, less onerous, approximation to biological reality.},

We have learned an enormous amount about diseases affecting Galapagos avifauna in the last 20 years or so, but gaps in our understanding exist because of the challenges posed by issues with imperfect detection of hosts, parasites and pathogens, and the diseases they cause as well as uncertainty about the size of the population of the target host. Nonetheless, sampling design and analytical approaches borrowed from population and community ecology offer a suite of tools to help fill the gaps in our knowledge about diseases in wildlife in Galapagos and beyond.},

Some of the most vulnerable ecosystems to human-increased fire frequency are old-growth               Araucaria araucana               forests of the southern Andes. We investigated the effects of wildfires on the density and richness of a lizard community in these ecosystems, considering fire frequency and elapsed time since last fire. During the 2018/2019 southern summer season, we conducted 71 distance sampling transects to detect lizards in Araucaria forests of Chile in four fire “treatments”: (1) unburned control, (2) long-term recovery, (3) short-term recovery, and (4) burned twice. We detected 713 lizards from 7 species. We found that the density and richness of lizards are impacted by wildfire frequency and time of recovery, mediated by the modification of habitat structure. The lizard community varied from a dominant arboreal species (               L. pictus               ) in unburned and long-recovered stands, to a combination of ground-dwelling species (               L. lemniscatus               and               L. araucaniensis               ) in areas affected by two fires. Araucaria forests provided key habitat features to forest reptiles after fires, but the persistence of these old-growth forests and associated biodiversity may be threatened given the increase in fire frequency.},

  abstract = {Bats are diverse and ecologically important, but are also subject to a suite of severe threats. Evidence for localized bat mortality from these threats is well-documented in some cases, but long-term changes in regional populations of bats remain poorly understood. Bat hibernation surveys provide an opportunity to improve understanding, but analysis is complicated by bats' cryptic nature, non-conformity of count data to assumptions of traditional statistical methods, and observation heterogeneities such as variation in survey timing. We used generalized additive mixed models (GAMMs) to account for these complicating factors and to evaluate long-term, regional population trajectories of bats. We focused on four hibernating bat species - little brown myotis (Myotis lucifugus), tri-colored bat (Perimyotis subflavus), Indiana myotis (M. sodalis), and northern myotis (M. septentrionalis) - in a four-state region of the eastern United States during 1999-2011. Our results, from counts of nearly 1.2 million bats, suggest that cumulative declines in regional relative abundance by 2011 from peak levels were 71\% (with 95\% confidence interval of +/- 11\%) in M. lucifugus, 34\% (+/- 38\%) in P. subflavus, 30\% (+/- 26\%) in M. sodalis, and 31\% (+/- 18\%) in M. septentrionalis. The M. lucifugus population fluctuated until 2004 before persistently declining, and the populations of the other three species declined persistently throughout the study period. Population trajectories suggest declines likely resulted from the combined effect of multiple threats, and indicate a need for enhanced conservation efforts. They provide strong support for a change in the IUCN Red List conservation status in M. lucifugus from Least Concern to Endangered within the study area, and are suggestive of a need to change the conservation status of the other species. Our modeling approach provided estimates of uncertainty, accommodated non-linearities, and controlled for observation heterogeneities, and thus has wide applicability for evaluating population trajectories in other wildlife species.},

  abstract = {Underwater visual census (UVC) is the most common approach for estimating diversity, abundance and size of reef fishes in shallow and clear waters. Abundance estimation through UVC is particularly problematic in species occurring at low densities and/or highly aggregated because of their high variability at both spatial and temporal scales. The statistical power of experiments involving UVC techniques may be increased by augmenting the number of replicates or the area surveyed. In this work we present and test the efficiency of an UVC method based on diver towed GPS, the Tracked Roaming Transect (TRT), designed to maximize transect length (and thus the surveyed area) with respect to diving time invested in monitoring, as compared to Conventional Strip Transects (CST). Additionally, we analyze the effect of increasing transect width and length on the precision of density estimates by comparing TRT vs. CST methods using different fixed widths of 6 and 20 m (FW3 and FW10, respectively) and the Distance Sampling (DS) method, in which perpendicular distance of each fish or group of fishes to the transect line is estimated by divers up to 20 m from the transect line. The TRT was 74\% more time and cost efficient than the CST (all transect widths considered together) and, for a given time, the use of TRT and/or increasing the transect width increased the precision of density estimates. In addition, since with the DS method distances of fishes to the transect line have to be estimated, and not measured directly as in terrestrial environments, errors in estimations of perpendicular distances can seriously affect DS density estimations. To assess the occurrence of distance estimation errors and their dependence on the observer’s experience, a field experiment using wooden fish models was performed. We tested the precision and accuracy of density estimators based on fixed widths and the DS method. The accuracy of the estimates was measured comparing the actual total abundance with those estimated by divers using FW3, FW10, and DS estimators. Density estimates differed by 13\% (range 0.1–31\%) from the actual values (average = 13.09\%; median = 14.16\%). Based on our results we encourage the use of the Tracked Roaming Transect with Distance Sampling (TRT+DS) method for improving density estimates of species occurring at low densities and/or highly aggregated, as well as for exploratory rapid-assessment surveys in which divers could gather spatial ecological and ecosystem information on large areas during UVC.},

The importance of this endeavor prompted the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service to evaluate their sun-to-shade coffee restoration program in Puerto Rico initiated in 2003. We quantified the responses of 12 resident avian species using estimates of local occupancy and extinction probabilities based on surveys conducted in 2015-2017 at 65 restored farms grouped according to time-since-initial-restoration (TSIR): new (2011-2014), intermediate (2007-2010), and old (2003-2006). We also surveyed 40 forest sites, which served as reference sites. Vegetation complexity increased with TSIR, ranging between 35 and 40\% forest cover in farms 6-9 years TSIR. Forest specialists (e.g. Loxigilla portoricencis) exhibited highest average occupancy in farms initially classified as intermediate (6-9 years) and old (¿10 years), paralleling occupancy in secondary forests. Occupancy of open-habitat specialists (e.g. Tiaris olivaceus) was more variable, but higher in recently restored farms. Restoring the shade layer has the potential to heighten ecological services derived from forest specialists (e.g. frugivores) without losing the services of many open-habitat specialists (e.g. insectivores). Annual local extinction probability for forest specialists decreased with increasing habitat complexity, strengthening the potential value of shade restoration as a tool to enhance habitat for avifauna that evolved in forested landscapes.},

In 1999, the basic design, with a focus on sampling the whole of the designated intertidal was created, and sampling was conducted for sessile species and large mobile invertebrates by point-intercept sampling of vertical transects and band surveys along transects, respectively. In 2002 and 2003, the same types of sampling were conducted, but quadrat sampling for small mobile invertebrates was added and then modified. This project has produced basic data on the presence, abundance, and spatial distribution of substrates and intertidal biota. Additionally, statistical power analyses conducted on the biological data have allowed assessment of the ability of the sampling to detect trends in the abundance of the predominant species. Current sampling has an 80 percent probability to detect +10 percent annual changes in abundance of all targeted species with an α = 0.05; the ability to detect –10 percent trends is not as uniformly high. Various options are discussed for decreasing the spatial variance of the data. The information presented provides a basis for discussion of the major questions being asked, how the sampling design might be reconfigured to be consistent in approach, and how the intertidal monitoring should interface with other potential intertidal monitoring.},

In two national parks, where GIS-based monitoring systems were in place, in the course of 2006, data were standardised and analysed in the same way. Encounters on patrol with illegal activities and large mammals were corrected for patrol effort and the size of the area to enable comparing encounter rates in different protected areas. In December 2005, law-enforcement performance was evaluated in six protected areas. Through dissemination of the evaluation report, the poor performance of patrol staff and high levels of illegal activity in five out of six sites entered the public domain, and created a spirit of competition between protected areas. The present evaluation showed that in the course of 2006, in the six sites evaluated, patrol performance improved by 59\% on average, compared to only 11\% in the two parks that were not evaluated. In the four savannah sites evaluated, poaching was reduced by 72\%, but only by 17\% in the two forest sites evaluated. This compares with a reduction in poaching of 33\% in the two parks. Patrol data were open to several types of error. Although reliability of patrol data was checked at different hierarchical levels, the final check was at headquarters in Accra, comparing seasonal fluctuations in large-mammal encounters with those in two control areas.

  abstract = {The primary objective of the Monitoring of Illegal Killing of Elephants (MIKE) programme is to monitor worldwide trends in elephant poaching. MIKE has been employing in its analyses the proportion of illegally killed elephants (PIKE) as a relative indicator of poaching levels. PIKE is subject to a number of potential biases that need to be understood to assess the validity of inferences made from analyses based on it. In four well-managed sites (Queen Elizabeth and Murchison Falls in Uganda, and Mole and Kakum in Ghana), a pilot study was carried out to examine the on-site reliability of PIKE. The detection probability of elephant carcasses was examined in relation to visibility (habitat types) on patrol, and PIKE results were compared with the results of a catch per unit effort (C/E) analysis. Due to sharply increased patrol coverage in three out of four sites, by 2011, the detection probability of elephant carcasses approached 1. PIKE, based on verified field data corrected for detection probability, compared well with data from the carcass sheets in the MIKE database. C/E results provided support for the on-site use of PIKE. Because the relationship between the C/E index and law-enforcement effort varied by site, which makes pooling of data complicated, for MIKE's purposes C/E analysis was not considered a practical tool with which to monitor worldwide elephant poaching. PIKE data on the other hand can be easily pooled, and the pooling may erode away some of its imperfections. PIKE was found to be superior to C/E analysis for a system like MIKE.},

  abstract = {Between 1995 and 1998 I studied bird communities through mist netting (MN) and the `Multi Time-Window Transect-Mapping' (MTW) technique for audiovisual surveys of tropical bird communities. The research was carried out in Playa de Oro (0 degrees 52'35 `' N, 78 degrees 47'40 `' W; 45-590 m a.s.l.), Esmeraldas, northwestern Ecuador. A total of 344 bird species are known to occur, though I presume that ¿400 species might be present in the study area, or migrate through it, on a regular basis. I sampled 18 transects (25.14 km), using the MTW method for rapid assessments. In order to perform a comparative study of the effectiveness of mist-netting and transect-mapping protocols, I chose two independent transects, MNT1 (625 m) and MNT2 (550 m), which were studied with both methods. They were located in a similarly structured habitat mosaic of cultivated land and selectively logged forest. The greater variety of human-managed habitats was the principal cause for higher species richness and diversity at MNT1 (n(MN) = 117; n(MTW) = 162) in comparison with MNT2 (n(MN) = 96; n(MTW) = 144). Nevertheless, according to the MTW data, the number of forest-dependent species (MNT1 = 78, MNT2 = 90) and threatened taxa (world: MNT1 = 4, MNT2 = 7; Ecuador: MNT1 = 37, MNT2 = 48) was higher at MNT2, likely due to the lower degree of fragmentation, higher foliage complexity, and lower hunting pressure. Biomass density was almost identical, with an estimated 193 kg/km(2) for MNT1 and 198 kg/km(2) for MNT2. The number of breeding `pairs' was roughly 2000 /km(2) and 1800 /km(2), and the average biomass per individual 36 g and 41 g, respectively. In conclusion, the conservation value of study sites should be ranked on the basis of a detailed comparison of habitat association as well as threat status of the bird species present, whereas species richness, diversity indices, and biomass density should not he used in this context. For example, the `bird community index' (BCI) sensu Canterbury et al. (2000) clearly reflected the higher value of MNT2 in comparison with MNT1 for the conservation of forest-dependent birds (BCI: MNT1 = -0.049 versus MNT2 = 0.541). Regarding the comparative effectiveness and efficiency, the results indicate that, in only 8-9\% (21-23 h) of the study time, 39-50\% (45 and 48) more bird species were recorded by transect mapping than by mist netting. High costs and low time efficiency, as well as inaccurate representation of entire bird groups, make the use of mist netting prohibitive for most survey purposes, unless the status and habitat selection of altitudinal and latitudinal migrants are concerned. Transect mapping is highly effective at detecting avian taxa that regularly vocalize. However, dispersing birds, floaters, long-distance migrants on passage, and very silent breeding residents were overlooked or underestimated. Thus, I developed optimized MTW protocols to further increase bird species detectability. For instance, implementing the specifically designed MTW monitoring protocol, a well-trained observer might record c. 70\% of the total species richness and 80-90\% of all breeding residents present in the transect area within as little as six days. For transects of up to 1200 m, sufficient data for rough estimations of absolute population and biomass densities can be obtained in the same period.},

Estimating the density from grouped data can be challenging. In this paper we propose a kernel density estimator of wildlife population density for such grouped data. Our method uses a combined cross-validation and smoothed bootstrap approach to select the optimal bandwidth for grouped data. Our simulation study shows that with the smoothing parameter selected with this method, the estimated density from grouped data matches the true density more closely than with other approaches. Using smoothed bootstrap, we also construct bias-adjusted confidence intervals for the value of the density at the boundary. We apply the proposed method to two grouped data sets, one from a wooden stake study where the true density is known, and the other from a survey of kangaroos in Australia.},

  abstract = {1. Faecal surveys are used widely to study variations in abundance and distribution of forest-dwelling mammals when direct enumeration is not feasible. The utility of faecal indices of abundance is limited, however, by observational bias and variation in faecal disappearance rates that obscure their relationship to population size. We developed methods to reduce variability in faecal surveys and improve reliability of faecal indices. 2. We used double-observer transect sampling to estimate observational bias of faecal surveys of Roosevelt elk Cervus elaphus roosevelti and Columbian black-tailed deer Odocoileus hemionus columbianus in Olympic National Park, Washington, USA. We also modelled differences in counts of faecal groups obtained from paired cleared and uncleared transect segments as a means to adjust standing crop faecal counts for a standard accumulation interval and to reduce bias resulting from variable decay rates. 3. Estimated detection probabilities of faecal groups ranged from {$<$} 0.2-1.0 depending upon the observer, whether the faecal group was from elk or deer, faecal group size, distance of the faecal group from the sampling transect, ground vegetation cover, and the interaction between faecal group size and distance from the transect. 4. Models of plot-clearing effects indicated that standing crop counts of deer faecal groups required 34\% reduction on flat terrain and 53\% reduction on sloping terrain to represent faeces accumulated over a standard 100-day interval, whereas counts of elk faecal groups required 0\% and 46\% reductions on flat and sloping terrain, respectively. 5. Synthesis and applications. Double-observer transect sampling provides a cost-effective means of reducing observational bias and variation in faecal decay rates that obscure the interpretation of faecal indices of large mammal abundance. Given the variation we observed in observational bias of faecal surveys and persistence of faeces, we emphasize the need for future researchers to account for these comparatively manageable sources of bias before comparing faecal indices spatially or temporally. Double-observer sampling methods are readily adaptable to study variations in faecal indices of large mammals at the scale of the large forest reserve, natural area, or other forested regions when direct estimation of populations is problematic.},

For biomes, protection ranges from 4\% to 25\%, with six of 14 biomes still below the 10\% level. Geographic patterns of protection have a distinct bias, with higher rates of protection in New World realms than Old World realms. Of the world's terrestrial ecoregions, half do not meet the 2010 Target and 76\% have less than 10\% of their area strictly protected. Approximately 13\% of ecoregions have no strict protected areas. Recent years have seen an expansion of the protected area network, with an average of 0.13\% of the global land area added per year. Most of the expansion since 2003 though has been in Brazil, particularly the Amazon. Without major investments in conservation, spread across the world's ecosystems, the world will likely miss the 2010 target. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Using the case example of Khao Yai National Park (KYNP) and data from a camera trap survey, we modeled and evaluated the effectiveness of ranger stations in reducing human access and illegal activities, and in increasing prey and predator presence. This type of data and analysis is needed to monitor and evaluate enforcement effectiveness and develop adaptive management strategies. At KYNP, we used camera-trapping data as a proxy to evaluate whether or not a positive impact of ranger stations on wildlife distribution could outweigh edge effects from human disturbance. We assessed factors affecting the distribution of poachers and wildlife using Maxent. Our analysis was based on 217 camera trap locations (6260 trap nights) and suggests that ungulates and poachers persist nearby ranger stations. Rangers should increase patrolling efforts of border areas; however, increasing wildlife patrolling in inaccessible areas with mobile range units may be more effective than establishing more ranger stations along park boundaries.},

  abstract = {Khao Yai National Park (KYNP) is well known for its biodiversity and has the potential to serve as a regional model for wildlife conservation. From October 2003 through October 2007, the managers of KYNP conducted a Carnivore Conservation Project to develop and implement long-term monitoring of their large mammal populations. We present these data as an example to demonstrate the usefulness of long-term camera-trapping despite data that cannot be fitted to mark/recapture or occupancy statistical frameworks. Overall, a relatively high number of camera trap photographs was obtained for viverrids (four species; 44 photos) and ursids (two species; 39 photos). However, a relatively low number (range, one to eight) of camera trap photographs was obtained for each of the four felid species and two canid species detected by cameras. Of a total survey effort of 6,260 trap nights, no tigers (Panthera tigris) were detected by camera traps, suggestive of at best a small, non-viable tiger population. Compared to previous camera-trapping efforts at KYNP, we expanded intensive sampling beyond the core area to include all zones and edges of the park. We found significantly lower relative abundance indices (RAIs) for certain mammal species, and collectively for all mammals compared to data obtained in 1999–2000 from 34 similar survey locations, suggesting population declines linked to increased human activity. Information from long-term camera-trapping can provide critical information on the occurrence of elusive species, hotspots, the role of invasive or domestic species, and an indication of the effectiveness of patrolling and other management and conservation interventions.},

Data analysis was performed using a hierarchical Bayesian model with covariates that can simultaneously determine the population size and detectability, as well as factors that significantly affect both parameters. The presence of the two most threatened species, the reed bunting Emberiza schoeniclus witherbyi and the moustached warbler Acrocephalus melanopogon, was significantly and positively related to the coverage of fen sedge Cladium mariscus, an indicator species for waters of high quality and low fluctuation in depth. The bearded parrotbill Panurus biarmicus was the most generalist species with no positive association with any of the studied variables.

  abstract = {In many cases, the first step in large-carnivore management is to obtain objective, reliable, and cost-effective estimates of population parameters through procedures that are reproducible over time. However, monitoring predators over large areas is difficult, and the data have a high level of uncertainty. We devised a practical multimethod and multistate modeling approach based on Bayesian hierarchical-site-occupancy models that combined multiple survey methods to estimate different population states for use in monitoring large predators at a regional scale. We used wolves (Canis lupus) as our model species and generated reliable estimates of the number of sites with wolf reproduction (presence of pups). We used 2 wolf data sets from Spain (Western Galicia in 2013 and Asturias in 2004) to test the approach. Based on howling surveys, the naive estimation (i.e., estimate based only on observations) of the number of sites with reproduction was 9 and 25 sites in Western Galicia and Asturias, respectively. Our model showed 33.4 (SD 9.6) and 34.4 (3.9) sites with wolf reproduction, respectively. The number of occupied sites with wolf reproduction was 0.67 (SD 0.19) and 0.76 (0.11), respectively. This approach can be used to design more cost-effective monitoring programs (i.e., to define the sampling effort needed per site). Our approach should inspire well-coordinated surveys across multiple administrative borders and populations and lead to improved decision making for management of large carnivores on a landscape level. The use of this Bayesian framework provides a simple way to visualize the degree of uncertainty around population-parameter estimates and thus provides managers and stakeholders an intuitive approach to interpreting monitoring results. Our approach can be widely applied to large spatial scales in wildlife monitoring where detection probabilities differ between population states and where several methods are being used to estimate different population parameters. Resumen En muchos casos, el primer paso en el manejo de carnivoros grandes es la obtencion de parametros objetivos, confiables y rentables de estimaciones poblacionales por medio de procedimientos que sean reproducibles en el tiempo. Sin embargo, el monitoreo de depredadores en areas extensas es complicado y los datos tienen un nivel alto de incertidumbre. Disenamos una estrategia multimetodo y multiestado basada en modelos bayesianos jerarquicos de ocupacion de sitio que combinan multiples metodos de seguimiento de censo para estimar los estados de diferentes poblaciones para su uso en el monitoreo de grandes depredadores a una escala regional. Usamos a los lobos (Canis lupus) como especie objetivo y generamos estimaciones confiables del numero de sitios con reproduccion de lobos (presencia de cachorros). Utilizamos dos conjuntos de datos sobre lobos de Espana (Galicia Occidental en 2013 y Asturias en 2014) para probar el modelo. Con base a los muestreos de aullidos, la estimacion ingenua (es decir, la estimacion basada solo en las observaciones) del numero de sitios con reproduccion fue de 9 y 25 sitios en Galicia Occidental y Asturias, respectivamente. Nuestro modelo mostro 33.4 (DS 9.6) y 34.4 (3.9) sitios con reproduccion de lobos, respectivamente. El numero de sitios ocupados con reproduccion de lobos fue de 0.67 (DS 0.19) y 0.76 (0.11), respectivamente. Este modelo puede usarse para disenar programas de monitoreo mas rentables (es decir, para definir el esfuerzo de muestreo necesario por sitio). Nuestro enfoque podria ser utilizado para seguimientos bien coordinados a traves de multiples fronteras administrativas y poblaciones, y apoyaria una mejor toma de decisiones para el manejo de grandes carnivoros a escala de paisaje. El uso de este marco de trabajo bayesiano proporciona una manera simple de visualizar el grado de incertidumbre alrededor de los parametros de estimaciones de poblacion, y asi proporciona a los administradores y a los sectores implicados una estrategia intuitiva para interpretar los resultados de los monitoreos. Nuestra estrategia puede aplicarse extensamente a escalas espaciales grandes en el monitoreo de vida silvestre en los casos en que las probabilidades de deteccion difieren entre los estados poblacionales cuando se estan utilizando varios metodos para estimar diferentes parametros poblacionales.},

Based on land-use data of the Tarim River Basin in Xinjiang of China in the 1950s, regarding the area of land use types as the parameter in scale selecting, the histograms of the patches in area are charted. Then, by reinforcing the normalized scale variances (NSV) with 3 landscape indices, the scale characteristics of land use in the Tarim River Basin can be summarized. (1) NSV in the Tarim River up to a maximum at scale of 1:50,000 which is considered appropriate for the Tarim River. (2) Diversity indices of saline land are consistent with NSV's. Diversity indices and NSV of sandy land showed that the appropriate scale is in the same scale domain. There is a significant difference between diversity indices and NSV of forestland and shrubland. (3) Fractal dimension of sandy land and saline land showed a hierarchical structure at a scale of 1:10,000. Fractal dimension of forestland and shrubland are distributed under the same hierarchical structure in the region.},

Although law enforcement is frequently used to protect tigers and their prey, the conditions under which enforcement is likely to be effective in recovering small populations of wild tigers are not well understood. We evaluated the effectiveness of a law enforcement strategy to recover tigers and their prey in Lao PDR where extensive habitat provided favorable conditions for large increases in tiger numbers if protected from poaching. Over a seven-year period, we monitored along a theory of change to evaluate assumptions about the causal linkages between intermediate results and biological outcomes. Although we found a strong positive correlation between funding for enforcement and days patrolled (rs = 0.786, n = 7, p = 0.05) and a significant negative correlation between days patrolled and overall hunting catch per unit effort (rs = -0.893,n = 7, p {$<$} 0.05), ultimately a proliferation in snaring was associated with decline in several indices of tiger abundance. We conclude that actions were sufficient to reduce poaching and increase prey populations, but insufficient to curtail extirpation of tigers. Recovering small populations of high-value wildlife such as tigers in promising source sites is dependent on establishing a complete enforcement regime, complimentary strategies that build support for the enforcement regime, and a nimble monitoring and evaluation system for agile adaptive management.

We show how repeated point counts, supplemented by observation distances, can account for two aspects of the counting process: (1) detection of birds conditional on being available for observation and (2) the availability of birds for detection given presence. We propose a hierarchical model that permits the radius in which birds are available for detection to vary with forest stand age (or other relevant habitat features), so that the number of birds available at each location is described by a Poisson-gamma mixture. Conditional on availability, the number of birds detected at each location is modeled by a beta-binomial distribution. We fit this model to repeated point count data of Florida scrub-jays and found evidence that the area in which birds were available for detection decreased with increasing stand age. Estimated density was 0.083 (95\%CI: 0.060-0.113) scrub-jays/ha. Point counts of birds have a number of appealing features. Based on our findings, however, an accounting for both components of the counting process may be necessary to ensure that abundance estimates are comparable across time and space. Our approach could easily be adapted to other species and habitats.},

This survey was conducted during the early breeding season, using a stratified random sample from habitat strata. The survey design was a 32-km road transect with 40 five-min point Counts at 800-m intervals. Detection probabilities were estimated using the removal method in which observations in one-min intervals were removed from further consideration. Model selection based on Akaike's Information Criterion resulted in a model where detection probability varied among observers, but was constant throughout the point count for each observer. Estimated detection probabilities for the point count duration were greater than 0.68 for all observers. Counts were adjusted for detection probability and then used to estimate the mean density within surveyed point count plots. Overall, the range-wide estimate of total population size was 161,181 individuals. The estimates were 183,231 individuals for 2004 and 139,131 for 2005, with corresponding 90\% confidence intervats of 113,324 to 422,046 and 97,611 to 198,252, respectively. In addition to estimates for both the United States and Canada, population densities were estimated for geographic sub-regions: Bird Conservation Regions, Shore-bird Planning Regions, administrative regions, and for each Canadian province.

Using a multidisciplinary dataset including: porpoise sightings from a multi-year land-based survey, Acoustic Doppler Current Profiling (ADCP), vertical profiling of water properties and high-resolution bathymetry; we investigate how interactions between tidal flow and topography drive the fine-scale porpoise spatio-temporal distribution at the site. Porpoise sightings were distributed non-uniformly within the survey area with highest sighting density recorded in areas with steep slopes and moderate depths. Greater numbers of sightings were recorded during strong westward (ebbing) tidal flows compared to strong eastward (flooding) flows and slack water periods. ADCP and Conductivity Temperature Depth (CTD) data identified fine-scale hydrodynamic features, associated with cross-reef tidal flows in the sections of the survey area with the highest recorded densities of porpoises. We observed layered, vertically sheared flows that were susceptible to the generation of turbulence by shear instability. Additionally, the intense, oscillatory near surface currents led to hydraulically controlled flow that transitioned from subcritical to supercritical conditions; indicating that highly turbulent and energetic hydraulic jumps were generated along the eastern and western slopes of the reef. The depression and release of isopycnals in the lee of the reef during cross-reef flows revealed that the flow released lee waves during upslope currents at specific phases of the tidal cycle when the highest sighting rates were recorded. The results of this unique, fine-scale field study provide new insights into specific hydrodynamic features, produced through tidal forcing, that may be important for creating predictable foraging opportunities for porpoises at a local scale. Information on the functional mechanisms linking porpoise distribution to static and dynamic physical habitat variables is extremely valuable to the monitoring and management of the species within the context of European conservation policies and marine renewable energy infrastructure development.

Because monitoring could absorb a large proportion of funds available for conservation, we believe indicators should be linked explicitly to monitoring objectives and decisions about which monitoring schemes deserve funding should be informed by predictions of the value of such schemes to decision making. We suggest that raising awareness among the public and policy makers, auditing management actions, and informing policy choices are the most important global monitoring objectives. Using four well-developed indicators of biological diversity (extent of forests, coverage of protected areas, Living Planet Index, Red List Index) as examples, we analyzed the characteristics needed for indicators to meet these objectives. We recommend that conservation professionals improve on existing indicators by eliminating spatial biases in data availability, fill gaps in information about ecosystems other than forests, and improve understanding of the way indicators respond to policy changes. Monitoring is not an end in itself, and we believe it is vital that the ultimate objectives of global monitoring of biological diversity inform development of new indicators.},

Human actions destroy between 1 and 2 million km(2) of such forests per decade, with concomitant carbon release into the atmosphere. Within these forests, protected areas are the principle defense against forest loss and species extinctions. Four regions-the Amazon, Congo, South American Atlantic Coast, and West Africa-once constituted about half the world's tropical moist forest. We measure forest cover at progressively larger distances inside and outside of protected areas within these four regions, using data-sets on protected areas and land-cover. We find important geographical differences. In the Amazon and Congo, protected areas are generally large and retain high levels of forest cover, as do their surroundings. These areas are protected de facto by being inaccessible and will likely remain protected if they continue to be so. Deciding whether they are also protected de jure - that is, whether effective laws also protect them-is statistically difficult, for there are few controls. In contrast, protected areas in the Atlantic Coast forest and West Africa show sharp boundaries in forest cover at their edges. This effective protection of forest cover is partially offset by their very small size: little area is deep inside protected area boundaries. Lands outside protected areas in the Atlantic Coast forest are unusually fragmented. Finally, we ask whether global databases on protected areas are biased toward highly protected areas and ignore “paper parks.” Analysis of a Brazilian database does not support this presumption.},

  abstract = {Abstract: Conservation funds are grossly inadequate to address the plight of threatened species. Government and conservation organizations faced with the task of conserving threatened species desperately need simple strategies for allocating limited resources. The academic literature dedicated to systematic priority setting usually recommends ranking species on several criteria, including level of endangerment and metrics of species value such as evolutionary distinctiveness, ecological importance, and social significance. These approaches ignore 2 crucial factors: the cost of management and the likelihood that the management will succeed. These oversights will result in misallocation of scarce conservation resources and possibly unnecessary losses. We devised a project prioritization protocol (PPP) to optimize resource allocation among New Zealand's threatened-species projects, where costs, benefits (including species values), and the likelihood of management success were considered simultaneously. We compared the number of species managed and the expected benefits gained with 5 prioritization criteria: PPP with weightings based on species value; PPP with species weighted equally; management costs; species value; and threat status. We found that the rational use of cost and success information substantially increased the number of species managed, and prioritizing management projects according to species value or threat status in isolation was inefficient and resulted in fewer species managed. In addition, we found a clear trade-off between funding management of a greater number of the most cost-efficient and least risky projects and funding fewer projects to manage the species of higher value. Specifically, 11 of 32 species projects could be funded if projects were weighted by species value compared with 16 projects if projects were not weighted. This highlights the value of a transparent decision-making process, which enables a careful consideration of trade-offs. The use of PPP can substantially improve conservation outcomes for threatened species by increasing efficiency and ensuring transparency of management decisions.},

Automated recorders deployed in the field have the potential to substantially reduce observer bias and the cost of human-based inventories, but their reliability and efficiency, particularly for common species of birds, are largely untested. Using digital audio data collected in 2013 by automated recorders within the Grampians National Park, Australia, we compared the performance of two species detection methods for four species of forest birds; manually scanning spectrograms and automating the identification of vocalisations by creating species-specific song templates, or `recognisers', using the software program Song Scope (Wildlife Acoustics). Both detection methods generally identified the target species at the same sites, but species were detected at additional sites exclusively by one or the other method. Surprisingly, across species, manual scanning was more time-efficient overall than automated recognition, but results varied due to high rates of false positives and variable performance from the automated recognition recognisers we created. While automated recognition has the potential to improve species detection, the decision of whether to manually scan or automate recognition will depend on the species' vocalisation characteristics, calling frequency, and template-matching algorithms used.},

Within such priority areas, different forest structures can have contrasting effects on avifauna, and could potentially lead to an overlapping but somewhat different species assemblage. Therefore, we aimed to quantify the relative importance of horizontal forest structures and fragmented habitats i.e., contiguous forest and isolated forest, in harboring avifauna and also understanding the patterns of diversity in different seasons in the Mai Valley IBA of Eastern Nepal. We used a double-observer method to collect bird species lists during repeated visits in winter and spring to an isolated and a contiguous forest area. We used Hill numbers and Hutcheson's t-test to account for differences in the number of survey points sampled in each forest. The study recorded higher diversity in the contiguous forest compared to the isolated forest. However, the bird assemblage based on foraging and habitat guild were found to be similar between these two forests. Despite the importance of both forests for avifauna, restricted-range species were recorded only in contiguous forest. The ecological integrity of contiguous forests provides a natural habitat with a variety of niches influencing the presence of forest specialists, which might lead to the higher species diversity observed in contiguous forest. Also, the difference in area, and forest management regime could have influenced the diversity difference between the two forest types. We recommend more research on avifaunal assemblage and their habitat to prioritize these critical areas for conservation. Furthermore, considering the role played by contiguous forest in maintaining bird communities, we emphasize the maintenance of forest birds corridors by preserving natural forests and planting native trees in private orchards in the Mai Valley Area.},

We documented seven anuran species, but Rio Grande leopard frogs (Rana berlandieri) accounted for 96\% of the visual counts. Chorus surveys along the river detected similar or fewer numbers of species, but orders of magnitude fewer individuals compared to visual surveys. The number of species varied on average by 37\% across monthly and nightly surveys. We found similar average coefficients of variation in counts of Rio Grande leopard frogs on monthly and nightly bases (CVs = 42-44 \%), suggesting that canoe surveys are a fairly precise technique for counts of this species. Numbers of Rio Grande leopard frogs observed were influenced by river gage levels and air and water temperatures, suggesting that surveys should be conducted under certain environmental conditions to maximize counts and maintain consistency. We found significant differences in species richness and bullfrog (Rana catesbeiana) counts among the four river stretches. Four rare anuran species were found along certain stretches but not others, which could represent either sampling error or unmeasured environmental or habitat differences among the river stretches. We found a greater association of Rio Grande leopard frogs with mud banks compared to rock or cliff (canyon) areas and with seepwillow and open areas compared to giant reed and other vegetation types. Canoe surveys appear to be a useful survey technique for anurans along the Rio Grande and may work for other large river systems as well.},

Initial dye experiments helped us determine appropriate dye concentrations and exposure times to use in mesocosm and field trials. The mesocosm study revealed higher tadpole detection rates, more accurate population estimates, and lower coefficients of variation among pools compared to those from the field study. In both mesocosm and field studies, CRE was the best method for estimating tadpole populations, followed by DOE and RE. In the field, RE, DI, and VI often underestimated populations in pools with higher tadpole numbers. DI improved with increased sampling. Larger pools supported larger tadpole populations, and tadpole detection rates in general decreased with increasing pool volume and surface area. Hence, pool size influenced bias in tadpole sampling. Across all techniques, tadpole detection rates differed among pools, indicating that sampling bias was inherent and techniques did not consistently sample the same proportion of tadpoles in each pool. Estimating bias (Le, calculating detection rates) therefore was essential in assessing tadpole abundance. Unlike VI and DOE, DI, RE, and CRE could be used in turbid waters in which tadpoles are not visible. The tadpole population estimates we used accommodated differences in detection probabilities in simple desert pool environments but may not work in more complex habitats.},

In the final report of the project, Kaartinen and Hyyppä (2008) reported a high variation in the quality of the published methods under boreal forest conditions and with varying laser point densities. This paper summarizes the findings beyond the final report after analyzing the results obtained in different tree height classes. Omission/Commission statistics as well as neighborhood relations are taken into account. Additionally, four automatic tree detection and extraction techniques were added to the test. Several methods in this experiment were superior to manual processing in the dominant, co-dominant and suppressed tree storeys. In general, as expected, the taller the tree, the better the location accuracy. The accuracy of tree height, after removing gross errors, was better than 0.5 m in all tree height classes with the best methods investigated in this experiment. For forest inventory, minimum curvature-based tree detection accompanied by point cloud-based cluster detection for suppressed trees is a solution that deserves attention in the future.},

In the mostly unprotected Laikipia-Samburu MIKE site in northern Kenya, elephant mortality data were collected using both standard law enforcement monitoring procedures, relying on patrolling, and participatory methods involving local communities. Qualitatively, traditional patrolling techniques were more successful in protected areas whereas participatory approaches provided more information outside protected areas, where elephant were most at risk from ivory poachers. A minimum of 35\% of the 389 verified carcasses during 2001-2003 were illegally killed. In this baseline study, land uses ranked from highest to lowest by the proportion of illegally killed elephants (PIKE) were community conservation areas, government trust lands, forest reserves, private ranches, settlement areas and national reserves. PIKE trends derived from traditional and participatory data sources were similar across years and indicate elephants were at greater risk in regions outside government or privately patrolled areas. We suggest that PIKE is a useful index for comparing levels and trends in illegal killing of elephants, and that carcass ratios and presence/absence of tusks are useful proxy indicators of mortality and its causes.Resume Le niveau et les tendances des massacres illegaux d'elephants sont mesures par le programme MIKE (Monitoring the Illegal Killing of Elephants- Suivi a long terme de la chasse illicite a l'elephant) utilise par la CITES (Convention sur le commerce international des especes de faune et de flore menacees d'extinction) dans differents sites d'Afrique et d'Asie.

Maintaining crucial ecosystem processes and services requires resilience to natural and anthropogenic disturbances. However, the resilience and stability of surviving biological communities remain poorly quantified. From a 10-y dataset comprising 2,880 bird censuses across a land-use gradient, we present three key findings concerning the resilience and stability of Costa Rican bird communities. First, seed dispersing, insect eating, and pollinating guilds were more resilient to low-intensity land use than high-intensity land use. Compared with forest assemblages, bird abundance, species richness, and diversity were all similar to 15\% lower in low-intensity land use and similar to 50\% lower in high-intensity land use. Second, patterns in species richness generally correlated with patterns in stability: guilds exhibited less variation in abundance in low-intensity land use than in high-intensity land use. Finally, interspecific differences in reaction to environmental change (response diversity) and possibly the portfolio effect, but not negative covariance of species abundances, conferred resilience and stability. These findings point to the changes needed in agricultural production practices in the tropics to better sustain bird communities and, possibly, the functional and service roles that they play.},

These estimates are often unreliable due to low and variable efficiency and are inappropriate when dealing with rare or endangered species. In the marine Lake Vouliagmeni, a density surface modelling (DSM) approach using survey data from line transects, integrated with a Geographic Information System (GIS), was used to estimate the population density of the endangered fan mussel Pinna nobilis. This is the first time that such an approach has been applied for a marine benthic species. DSM was beneficial in relation to traditional distance sampling. Apart from providing a more precise total abundance estimate, it related the density of the species to spatial covariates of interest, gave a depiction of the species dispersion in the study area, and provided abundance estimates in any sub-region of the study area. In Lake Vouliagmeni, a marked zonation of P. nobilis distribution was revealed, with the species being restricted in the shallow peripheral zone at depths {$<$} 22 m. Two density peaks were observed, a major peak at depths between 12 and 13 m and a secondary peak at -4 m. A main hotspot of high density was also observed in the northeastern part of the lake. Total abundance of the species was estimated to be 6,770 individuals with a 95\% confidence interval of 5,460-8,393 individuals.},

  abstract = {Effective monitoring of populations and communities is a prerequisite for ecosystembased management of marine areas. However, monitoring programs often neglect important sources of error and thus can lead to biased estimates, spurious conclusions and false management actions. One such source of error is ‘imperfect detectability’, i.e. the inability of investigators to detect all individuals or all species in a surveyed area. Although there has been great effort to develop monitoring methods that account for imperfect detectability, the application of such methods in the marine environment is not as apparent as in other systems. Plot sampling is by far the most commonly applied method for biological monitoring in the marine environment, yet it largely ignores detectability issues. However, distance sampling, mark-recapture methods, repeated presence-absence surveys for occupancy estimation, and removal methods do estimate detection probabilities and provide unbiased estimates of state variables. We review these methods and the relevant tools for their application in studies on marine populations and communities, with the aim of assisting marine biologists and managers to understand the limitations and pitfalls associated with some approaches and to select the best available methods for their monitoring needs.},

Simple indices based on the number of encounters with a study object are used throughout ecology, conservation and natural resource management (e.g. indices of abundance used in animal surveys or catch per unit effort (CPUE) data in fisheries management). All forms of encounter data arise through the interaction of two sets of behaviours: those of the data generators and those of the data collectors. Analyses of encounter data are prone to bias when these behaviours do not conform to the assumptions used to model them. 2. We review the use of CPUE indices derived from patrol data, which have been promoted for the study of rule-breaking in conservation, highlighting potential sources of bias and noting how similar problems have been tackled for other forms of encounter data. 3. We identify several issues that must be addressed for analyses of patrol data to provide useful information, including the definition of suitable measures of catch and effort, the choice of appropriate temporal and spatial scales, the provision of suitable incentives for ranger patrols and the recording of sufficient information to describe the spatial pattern of sampling. The same issues are also relevant to encounter data more generally. 4. Synthesis and applications. This review describes a common conceptual framework for understanding encounter data, based on the interactions that produce them. We anticipate that an appreciation of these commonalities will lead to improvements in the analysis of encounter data in several fields, by highlighting the existence of methodological approaches that could be more widely applied, and important characteristics of these data that have so far been neglected.]},

Their success depends on changing the incentives of potential rule-breakers and those who monitor and enforce compliance. Project implementers may use payments to encourage monitoring and sanctions to deter rule breaking but there has been little research to examine the effectiveness of such approaches in promoting compliance with conservation rules. The effects of payments and sanctions on poaching in a hypothetical community-based conservation project were investigated using an individual-based model incorporating individual heterogeneity and a realistic range of behaviours. Individuals could choose to poach, monitor others' behaviour, or 'cheat' (claim a fee without actually monitoring behaviour). They could also invest in avoidance to reduce their probability of being detected breaking rules. Community-level outcomes emerged from individuals' choices and strategic interactions. The model demonstrates that payments and sanctions can interact strongly with one another and that their effects depend on the economic context in which they are applied. Sanctions were more reliable than payments in reducing poaching and, in some circumstances, payments produced perverse effects. It is thus important to consider individual-level heterogeneity and strategic decision-making when designing interventions aimed at changing human behaviour.},

In this project, we assessed inter-observer differences in the identification and enumeration of adult Pacific lamprey (Entosphenus tridentatus) imaged with DIDSON passing a large dam fishway. Six trained viewers independently identified lamprey observation `events' in the same similar to 12 h of DIDSON data collected at several fishway locations using two sonar orientations. Among-viewer variability in lamprey enumeration was high and viewer agreement on individual lamprey was often low. A total of 274 unique potential Pacific lamprey events was identified, but individual viewers scored only 89-173 events each (mean = 131, CV = 24\%) or 32-63\% of the total. Viewer identification rates (events/h) varied several-fold at some sites which we attributed primarily to event non-detection rather than species misclassification. Identification differences were related to viewer confidence, image duration, total fish density, and sonar orientation. Among-viewer agreement was highest in standard-orientation deployments lateral to the swimming lamprey, where images appeared as though acquired from overhead. Imagery in standard orientation had longer event duration and enhanced detection of anguilliform swimming, the most important characteristic for distinguishing Pacific lamprey from other species. Lamprey events observed in rolled orientation (sonar rotated 90 degrees) tended to be short duration with foreshortened head-or tail-first images that reduced viewer confidence. Our results highlight the importance of quality control assessments in acoustic imaging studies, especially those targeting cryptic species and those conducted in hydraulically challenging, multi-species environments.},

In addition to reducing the risk of high-severity wildfires in unwanted areas, stand thinning may increase wildlife and plant diversity and provide increased opportunity for seedling recruitment. We initiated conservative (i.e. minimal removal of trees) ponderosa stand thinning treatments with the goals of reducing fire risk and improving habitat conditions for native wildlife and flora. We then compared site occupancy of brown-headed cowbirds (Molothrus ater), chipping sparrows (Spizella passerina), plumbeous vireos (Vireo plumbeus), and western wood-pewees (Contopus sordidulus) in thinned and unthinned (i.e., control) forest stands from 2007 to 2009. Survey stations located in thinned stands had 64\% fewer trees/ha, 25\% less canopy cover, and 23\% less basal area than stations in control stands. Occupancy by all three host species was negatively associated with tree density, suggesting that these species respond favorably to forest thinning treatments in ponderosa pine forests. We also encountered plumbeous vireos more frequently in plots closer to an ecotonal (forest/grassland) edge, an association that may increase their susceptibility to edge-specialist, brood parasites like brown-headed cowbirds. Occupancy of brown-headed cowbirds was not related to forest metrics but was related to occupancy by plumbeous vireos and the other host species in aggregate, supporting previous reports on the affiliation between these species. Forest management practices that promote heterogeneity in forest stand structure may benefit songbird populations in our area, but these treatments may also confer costs associated with increased cowbird occupancy. Further research is required to understand more on the complex relationships between occupancy of cowbirds and host species, and between cowbird occupancy and realized rates of nest parasitism.

  abstract = {Context. The shore-based survey is a common, non-invasive, and low-cost method in marine mammal science, but its scientific applications are currently limited. Such studies typically target populations whose distributions are not random with respect to nearshore sites and involve repeated scans of the same area from single, stationary platforms. These circumstances prohibit the use of classic distance sampling techniques for estimating animal densities or distributions, particularly the derivation of a detection function that describes the probability of detecting targets at various distances from the observer. Aims. Here, we present a technique for estimating land-based detection functions, as well as quantifying uncertainty in their parameterisation, on the basis of the range-specific variability of observations from one scan to the next. Methods. This Bayesian technique uses Monte Carlo simulation to determine the likelihood of thousands of candidate detection functions, then conducts weighted sampling to generate a posterior distribution estimate of the detection function parameterisation. We tested the approach with both archival and artificial datasets built from known detection functions that reflect whale and porpoise detectability. Key results. When the base distribution of targets was random, the whale detection function was estimated without error (i.e. the difference of the median of the posterior and the true value was 0.00), and the porpoise detection function was estimated with an error equal to 4.23\% of the true value. When the target base distribution was non-random, estimation error remained low (2.57\% for targets concentrated offshore, 1.14\% when associated with nearshore habitats). When applied to field observations of humpback whales and Dall's porpoises from a land-based study in northern British Columbia, Canada, this technique yielded credible results for humpback whales, but appeared to underestimate the detectability of Dall's porpoises. Conclusion. The findings presented here indicate that this approach to detection function estimation is appropriate for long-running surveys in which scan regularity is high and the focus is on large, slow-moving, low herd-size, and easily detectable species. Implications. The derivation of a detection function is a critical step in density estimation. The methodology presented here empowers land-based studies to contribute to quantitative monitoring and assessment of marine mammal populations in coastal habitats.},

  abstract = {Estimating wildlife abundance is central to conservation. We compared two widely practiced standards for counting animals - aerial strip surveys and ground line transects - with interpreted counts of animal tracks. At equal sampling intensity in semiarid savanna with good visibility all three methods produced similar population estimates and precision for six large herbivores. This comparison adds empirical support for the use of track count data to estimate population density rather than being restricted to ambiguous indices of relative abundance. Although expected to capture more species than aerial surveys, we found line transects limiting because encounter rates by direct sightings were relatively low; a minimum threshold 40 observations was achieved for only 1/3 of antelope species in 648.4 km of transect. By contrast, animal track counts returned exceedingly high encounter rates that allowed estimation of abundance for the entire large predator-prey community and mapping density-distributions more completely. Unlike aerial surveys conducted by Botswana's wildlife authority, the track survey provided opportunity to involve local people in the research process. The track survey cost 40\% less than the aerial survey, and could be reduced a further 3-fold if trackers collected data autonomously without motor vehicles. Counting animals by their tracks is ultimately constrained to regions with appropriate substrates. However, in suitable environments like the Kalahari, we suggest that a citizen science driven by expert local trackers could ultimately replace conventional wildlife counts, generating knock-on benefits to conservation beyond improved data.},

Body mass–day range scaling rules and empirical track counts were applied to an established formula to estimate a wide range of wildlife densities. Using the southern Kalahari ecosystem of Botswana as an example, I provide the first comprehensive density estimates for the mammalian wildlife community ({$>$}0.2 kg), including densities for several species previously unattainable by other methods. Among a subset of species, empirical day ranges from this area were consistently greater than those predicted using scaling rules modeled with species from diverse ecosystems. I applied a correction factor based on this discrepancy, which generated values congruent with independent density estimates from the area. Although accurate measures of day range are a practical constraint to estimating densities from track counts, the results suggest that modest efforts to obtain location-specific day range estimates for a subset of species can improve density estimates for others derived from general allometric relationships. Given the strength of track surveys to accumulate unbiased observations quickly, in environments where animal tracks are readily visible, this approach shows potential for the rapid assessment of wildlife abundance.},

Assuming perfect detection introduces bias into estimation that can weaken inference upon which understanding and policy are based.

We conducted a quantitative literature review of 537 ecological articles to measure the degree to which studies of different taxa, at various scales, and over time have accounted for imperfect detection. Overall, just 23\% of articles accounted for imperfect detection. The probability that an article incorporated imperfect detection increased with time and varied among taxa studied; studies of vertebrates were more likely to incorporate imperfect detection. Among articles that reported detection probability, 70\% contained per-survey estimates of detection that were less than 0.5. For articles in which constancy of detection was tested, 86\% reported significant variation. We hope that our findings prompt more ecologists to consider carefully the detection process when designing studies and analyzing results, especially for subdisciplines where incorporation of imperfect detection in study design and analysis so far has been lacking.},

  abstract = {Fire is used as a management tool for biodiversity conservation worldwide. A common objective is to avoid population extinctions due to inappropriate fire regimes. However, in many ecosystems, it is unclear what mix of fire histories will achieve this goal. We determined the optimal fire history of a given area for biological conservation with a method that links tools from 3 fields of research: species distribution modeling, composite indices of biodiversity, and decision science. We based our case study on extensive field surveys of birds, reptiles, and mammals in fire-prone semi-arid Australia. First, we developed statistical models of species’ responses to fire history. Second, we determined the optimal allocation of successional states in a given area, based on the geometric mean of species relative abundance. Finally, we showed how conservation targets based on this index can be incorporated into a decision-making framework for fire management. Pyrodiversity per se did not necessarily promote vertebrate biodiversity. Maximizing pyrodiversity by having an even allocation of successional states did not maximize the geometric mean abundance of bird species. Older vegetation was disproportionately important for the conservation of birds, reptiles, and small mammals. Because our method defines fire management objectives based on the habitat requirements of multiple species in the community, it could be used widely to maximize biodiversity in fire-prone ecosystems.},

  abstract = {A key task in ecology is to understand the drivers of animal distributions. In arid and semi-arid environments, this is challenging because animal populations show considerable spatial and temporal variation. An effective approach in such systems is to examine both broad-scale and long-term data. We used this approach to investigate the distribution of small mammal species in semi-arid ‘mallee’ vegetation in south-eastern Australia. First, we examined broad-scale data collected at 280 sites across the Murray Mallee region. We used generalized additive mixed models (GAMMs) to examine four hypotheses concerning factors that influence the distribution of individual mammal species at this scale: vegetation structure, floristic diversity, topography and recent rainfall. Second, we used long-term data from a single conservation reserve (surveyed from 1997 to 2012) to examine small mammal responses to rainfall over a period spanning a broad range of climatic conditions, including record high rainfall in 2011. Small mammal distributions were strongly associated with vegetation structure and rainfall patterns, but the relative importance of these drivers was species-specific. The distribution of the mallee ningaui Ningaui yvonneae, for example, was largely determined by the cover of hummock grass; whereas the occurrence of the western pygmy possum Cercartetus concinnus was most strongly associated with above-average rainfall. Further, the combination of both broad-scale and long-term data provided valuable insights. Bolam’s mouse Pseudomys bolami was uncommon during the broad-scale survey, but long-term surveys showed that it responds positively to above-average rainfall. Conceptual models developed for small mammals in temperate and central arid Australia, respectively, were not, on their own, adequate to account for the distributional patterns of species in this semi-arid ecosystem. Species-specific variation in the relative importance of different drivers was more effectively explained by qualitative differences in life-history attributes among species.},

Mammals have been central to many computational and statistical developments in recent years, including refinements to traditional approaches and metrics (e.g., capture-recapture) as well as advancements of novel and developing fields (e.g., spatial capture-recapture, occupancy modeling, integrated population models). The study of mammals also poses challenges in terms of fully characterizing dynamics in natural conditions. Ongoing climate change threatens to affect global ecosystems, and mammals provide visible and charismatic subjects for research on local and regional effects of such change as well as predictive modeling of the longterm effects on ecosystem function and stability. Although much remains to be done, the population ecology of mammals continues to be a vibrant and rapidly developing field.

We conducted 620 1-h lookout watches over the forest canopy from 14 elevated locations along 13.1 km of paved road through Bala, during which we recorded all detections and movements of target species. For a further 619 h, we also recorded all in-forest detections of target species during excursions along and adjacent to the road. Our records covered all months of the year and hours of the day, enabling us to estimate seasonal and diurnal patterns of detection for each target species. We found significant seasonal and diurnal variation for all commoner species in rates of overall detection, visual versus aural detection, and vociferousness. We related most monthly variation to the timing of nesting and most hourly variation to aspects of the behavioural ecology of each species. We used three techniques to estimate dispersion and density for each species, two from lookouts based on our counts of individuals or breeding units per unit area observed, and one from spot maps of core breeding units within 500 m of the road. Differences in our estimates of density varied within and between species, but were mostly lowest for the mean number of individuals detected from lookouts and highest for the maximum of breeding units, whether from lookout detections or core area counts from spot maps. These ranges of densities and their variance indicate upper and lower estimates for each species, and the differences between them and other survey techniques were explicable partly by the behavioural ecology of each species or apparent changes in density. Our density estimates never exceeded the highest comparative estimates for target species or near relatives in other forest habitats, although few were available for diurnal raptors. We suggest that 1-h lookout watches over forest, where feasible, offer alternative and efficient estimates of detection, dispersion and density to conventional distance-sampling techniques conducted from within forest. They will achieve optimum accuracy when conducted during the most detectable periods for target species, particularly for obvious and sparsely dispersed bird species.},

Hitherto, it was unknown whether the same covariate was allowed to affect both abundance and detectability. This situation was disconcerting, because relationships between abundance and such covariates describing, for example, habitat, lie at the heart of ecology. I test this by simulation and provide additional guidelines on the model as well as code to fit it in a Bayesian mode of analysis. I simulated 1,000 data sets mimicking the Swiss breeding-bird survey “Monitoring Haufige Brutvogel” (three surveys in each of 268 quadrats). Elevation affected abundance negatively and detectability positively, resulting in a hump-shaped relationship between counts and elevation. I used WinBUGS to fit the model and estimate parameters, including quad rat-specific abundance and total abundance, across all 268 quadrats. For every parameter, the model recovered estimates that showed no indication of bias. The mean error in the estimated total population size across all quadrats was only 2\%, whereas the summed maximum counts, a conventional abundance estimate, underestimated total population size by 43\%. In contrast to maximum counts, the binomial mixture model revealed the true negative relationship between abundance and elevation. This model is a promising new alternative to capture-recapture or distance sampling methods to estimate bird abundance free of distorting effects of detectability. It has perhaps the fewest requirements, needing neither individual identification nor distance information to “convert” simple counts (”relative abundance”) into estimates of true abundance. It ought to be seriously considered in future bird-survey schemes.},

  abstract = {Biodiversity monitoring is important to identify conservation needs and test the efficacy of management actions. Variants of "abundance" (N) are among the most widely monitored quantities, e.g., (true) abundance, number of occupied sites (distribution, occupancy) or species richness. We propose a sampling-based view of monitoring that clearly acknowledges two sampling processes involved when monitoring N. First, measurements from the surveyed sample area are generalized to a larger area, hence the importance of a probability sample. Second, even within sampled areas only a sample of units (individuals, occupied sites, species) is counted owing to imperfect detectability p. If p {$<$} 1, counts are random variables and their expectation E(n) is related to N via the relationship E(n) = N*p. Whenever p {$<$} 1, counts vary even under identical conditions and underestimate N, and patterns in counts confound patterns in N with those in p. In addition, part of the population N may be unavailable for detection, e.g., temporarily outside the sampled quadrat, underground or for another reason not exposed to sampling; hence a more general way of describing a count is E(n) = N*a*p, where a is availability probability and p detection, given availability. We give two examples of monitoring schemes that highlight the importance of explicitly accounting for availability and detectability. In the Swiss reptile Red List update, the widespread and abundant slow worm (Anguis fragilis) was recorded in only 22.1\% of all sampled quadrats. Only an analysis that accounted for both availability and detectability gave realistic estimates of the species' distribution. Among 128 bird species monitored in the Swiss breeding bird survey, detection in occupied 1 km2 quadrats averaged only 64\% and varied tremendously by species (3-99 \%); hence observed distributions greatly underestimated range sizes and should not be compared among species. We believe that monitoring design and analyses should properly account for these two sampling processes to enable valid inferences about biodiversity. We argue for a more rigorous approach to both monitoring design and analysis to obtain the best possible information about the state of nature. An explicit recognition of, and proper accounting for, the two sampling processes involved in most monitoring programs will go a long way towards this goal.},

  abstract = {Abundance estimation in ecology is usually accomplished by capture–recapture, removal, or distance sampling methods. These may be hard to implement at large spatial scales. In contrast, binomial mixture models enable abundance estimation without individual identification, based simply on temporally and spatially replicated counts. Here, we evaluate mixture models using data from the national breeding bird monitoring program in Switzerland, where some 250 1-km2 quadrats are surveyed using the territory mapping method three times during each breeding season. We chose eight species with contrasting distribution (wide–narrow), abundance (high–low), and detectability (easy–difficult). Abundance was modeled as a random effect with a Poisson or negative binomial distribution, with mean affected by forest cover, elevation, and route length. Detectability was a logit-linear function of survey date, survey date-by-elevation, and sampling effort (time per transect unit). Resulting covariate effects and parameter estimates were consistent with expectations. Detectability per territory (for three surveys) ranged from 0.66 to 0.94 (mean 0.84) for easy species, and from 0.16 to 0.83 (mean 0.53) for difficult species, depended on survey effort for two easy and all four difficult species, and changed seasonally for three easy and three difficult species. Abundance was positively related to route length in three high-abundance and one low-abundance (one easy and three difficult) species, and increased with forest cover in five forest species, decreased for two nonforest species, and was unaffected for a generalist species. Abundance estimates under the most parsimonious mixture models were between 1.1 and 8.9 (median 1.8) times greater than estimates based on territory mapping; hence, three surveys were insufficient to detect all territories for each species. We conclude that binomial mixture models are an important new approach for estimating abundance corrected for detectability when only repeated-count data are available. Future developments envisioned include estimation of trend, occupancy, and total regional abundance.},

  abstract = {Biodiversity monitoring is important to identify biological units in need of conservation and to check the effectiveness of conservation actions. Programs generally monitor species richness and its changes (trend). Usually, no correction is made for imperfect species detectability. Instead, it is assumed that each species present has the same probability of being recorded and that there is no difference in this detectability across space and time, e.g. among observers and habitats. Consequently, species richness is determined by enumeration as the sum of species recorded. In Switzerland, the federal government has recently launched a comprehensive program that aims at detecting changes in biodiversity at all levels of biological integration. Birds are an important part of that program. Since 1999, 2-3 visits per breeding season are made to each of ¿250 1 km(2) squares to map the territories of all detected breeding bird species. Here, we analyse data from three squares to illustrate the use of capture-recapture models in monitoring to obtain detectability-corrected estimates of species richness and trend. Species detectability averaged only 85\%. Hence an estimated 15\% of species present remained overlooked even after three visits. Within a square, changes in detectability for different years were of the same magnitude when surveys were conducted by the same observer as when they were by different observers. Estimates of trend were usually biased and community turnover was overestimated when based on enumeration. Here we use bird data as an illustration of methods. However, species detectability for any taxon is unlikely ever to be perfect or even constant across categories to be compared. Therefore, monitoring programs should correct for species detectability.},

Mathematical and statistical models play a critical role in this process by integrating data from multiple sources in a way that is honest about uncertainty. We show the utility of Bayesian hierarchical models for supporting decisions on managing natural resources of national parks. These models can assimilate monitoring data to provide true forecasts, resulting in probabilistic predictions of future states of park ecosystems accompanied by rigorous estimates of uncertainty. We discuss a novel approach for communicating these forecasts to decision makers who need to evaluate the probability that NPS goals will be met given different management actions, including the null model of no action. We illustrate how this approach has been used successfully to inform decisions on the elk (Cervus elaphus nelsoni) population management in Rocky Mountain National Park based on 47 yr of monitoring data. Forecasts from a discrete time, stage-structured population model assimilated with annual census and sex and age classifications are being used annually to help park managers decide on actions needed to meet goals for elk and vegetation. In particular, park managers were able to determine the probability that the elk population would fall within a desired population range, which led to both population reduction actions and no action depending on the year of interest. Moreover, this approach allowed multiple survey methodologies from the last 47 years to be incorporated into a single model with associated estimates of uncertainty. Models like this one are especially useful for adaptive management where continuous improvement in models and data results in long-term improvement in the wisdom of policy and management.},

We conducted a multiyear pilot study to test the effectiveness of eDNA for detecting fish under ice. In the spring of 2016, 2017, and 2018, we sampled for juvenile Chinook Salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha in the Tanana Flats (Alaska, USA) by using minnow traps and by using eDNA in the spring of 2017 and 2018. We used traps at 97 sites and analyzed eDNA that was isolated from water samples at 36 sites, using an established, species-specific quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assay for Chinook Salmon. We detected Chinook Salmon by using eDNA at 12 of the 36 eDNA-sampled sites but did not capture any live juveniles in the minnow traps. Assuming that positive eDNA detections are reliable indicators of recent fish presence, we found that eDNA can be a more efficient and cost-effective alternative for monitoring aquatic communities under extreme winter conditions. Based on our experience, including eDNA-based screening of target sampling sites could prove to be a significant boost to the effectiveness of fish monitoring in remote and challenging habitats.},

In first site (site I), population had random pattern while in second site (site II) clumped pattern was observed. Crown diameters and spatial situation of all trees were recorded using distance and azimuth. Data were transferred to computer and stem map was generated with ArcGIS Software. Distance sampling methods include point-centred quarter method (PCQ), joint-point method (JP), Random pairs method (RP), T-Square method (T-Sq) and Quartered neighbour methods beside fixed area plot (FAP), n-tree and variable area transect (VAT) methods were conducted on generated stem maps. A time study was done aiding indices determined in field works. In site I, point centred quarter estimator with measurements to the second closest individual in each quadrant had the lowest relative bias (RBIAS) in estimating density followed by 3-tree and closest individual methods. In clumped pattern (site II), variable area transect method with measurements to the 4th and 5th closest individuals in each transect brought the best results. The most time consuming methods after fixed area plot, were point centred quarter estimators while methods considering measurement to the closest individual were rapid. Considering RBIAS and Time together, VAT method was the best sampling method in clumped pattern followed by point centred quarter estimator with measurements to the second closest individual in each quadrant and closest individual estimators. In random pattern, point centred quarter estimator with measurements to the second closest individual in each quadrant was the best method followed by 3-tree and closest individual estimators. But for estimating cover per unit area N-tree methods performed well. As in this site, VAT method located in 4th grade, and due to simplicity of field works related to this method, in the case that the investigator would not be able to clearly define spatial pattern of the population, this method can be recommended as well.},

We used the method in a natural shrub-land of Saxaul (Haloxylon ammodenderon C.A.M) to define optimum parameters include transect width and individual's number to which, distance is measured. Three transect widths were chosen, 10-m, 15-m and 20-m and distances to the 3(rd), 4(th) and 5(th) individual. Transect width affected the estimation, a 20-m width transect had the least relative bias (-0.5\%), and a 10-m width sampling had the greatest bias (-20\%). However, all methods underestimated the plant density. The most accurate estimation was with the 3(rd) plant distance and 20-m transect. As the VAT method is more efficient per unit effort in the field than the quadrate methods, it can be recommended for rapid assessment of desert communities density (like saxaul) especially when plants are dispersed at random.},

  abstract = {Estimating population density and population dynamics is essential for understanding primate ecology and relies on robust methods. While distance sampling theory provides a robust framework for estimating animal abundance, implementing a constrained, non-systematic transect design could bias density estimates. Here, we assessed potential bias associated with line distance sampling surveys along roads based on a case study with olive baboons (Papio anubis) in Lake Manyara National Park (Tanzania). This was achieved by comparing density estimates of olive baboons derived from road transect surveys with density estimates derived from estimating the maximum number of social groups (via sleeping site counts) and multiplying this metric with the estimated average size of social groups. From 2011 to 2019, we counted olive baboons along road transects, estimated survey-specific densities in a distance sampling framework, and assessed temporal population trends. Based on the fitted half-normal detection function, the mean density was 132.5 baboons km-2 (95\% CI: 110.4–159.2), however, detection models did not fit well due to heaping of sightings on and near the transects. Density estimates were associated with relatively wide confidence intervals that were mostly caused by encounter rate variance. Based on a generalized additive model, baboon densities were greater during the rainy seasons compared to the dry seasons but did not show marked annual trends. Compared to estimates derived from the alternative method (sleeping site survey), distance sampling along road transects overestimated the abundance of baboons more than threefold. Possibly, this overestimation was caused by the preferred use of roads by baboons. While being a frequently used technique (due to its relative ease of implementation compared to spatially randomized survey techniques), inferring population density of baboons (and possibly other species) based on road transects should be treated with caution. Beyond these methodological concerns and considering only the most conservative estimates, baboon densities in LMNP are among the highest across their geographic distribution range.},

Management strategies remain controversial, as attempts to rapidly minimize the impact of cats may conflict with finding an ethical means of population reduction in this domesticated species. Trap-Neuter-Return (TNR) is a non-lethal strategy which can theoretically lead to population decline with an ethical approach. The present study aimed to estimate free-roaming cat populations and also to measure the efficacy of a one-year TNR campaign in a highly urban area. Using a sight/resight methodology, we examined free-roaming cat populations in four sites across two neighbourhoods (Harlem and Bedford-Stuyvesant) in New York City. Sampling was repeated after 1 year, during which an intensive TNR effort occurred in each of those areas. Results from this study found population estimates range from 2.6-4.1 cats/km. Additionally, we found between 78-98\% turnover in each study area. After one year of TNR, the proportion of sterilised individuals in our treatment sites increased to 50\%. Model results suggest there is no evidence that sterilised individuals are more likely to be encountered, indicating that sterilisation may not affect movement patterns of cats. Free-roaming cats occur at high densities at all study sites, though populations varied, even within the same neighbourhood. We found evidence of considerable migration within study sites, which further complicates the application of a sterilisation management strategy. Management strategies directed toward free-roaming cats, such as TNR, may require a broad-scale approach, involving different facets of the community and should occur over multiple years.},

Mean cost per DNA sample to collect and analyze was US\$433 for tissue samples and US\$33 for fecal pellets.

We present SIAFOR, a computer programme for the calculation of four nearest-neighbour indices, which describe the spatial arrangement of tree positions, the distribution pattern of species, and the size differentiation between trees. The study uses SIAFOR as a sampling simulator in eight completely stem-mapped forest stands of varying area and structural complexity. We statistically evaluate two sample types (distance and plot sampling), comparing sampling error, bias and minimum sample size for index estimation. We introduce the concepts of measurement expansion factor (MEF) and design expansion factor (DEF) for the technical evaluation of sample type efficiency (optimal sample type). Results indicate that sampling error can reach high levels and that minimum sample sizes for index estimation often amply exceed the limit of 20\% of tree density or 20 trees per species per hectare, that we set as the highest feasible sample size in normal situations. We found clear feasibility limits (in terms of minimal tree densities and reachable accuracy levels) for the estimation of all investigated indices. Generally, equal or higher sample sizes are needed for plot sampling than for distance sampling to reach equal accuracy levels. Nevertheless, plot sampling resulted more efficient for the estimation of tree size differentiation at low to medium accuracy levels. For all other investigated indices distance sampling resulted more efficient than plot sampling. Minimum sample size increases with accuracy and is negatively correlated with tree density. At a given accuracy level minimum sample size is highest for the estimation of relative mingling and lowest for tree size differentiation; furthermore it is generally lower in large stands than in small ones. Because of the consistency of our conclusions in all of the investigated stands, we think they apply in most stands of similar area (between 1 and 10 ha) and species diversity (not more than four species).

  abstract = {We predicted that bird diversity and abundance of some bird species would be higher in old-growth stands than in mature pine stands because of the greater structural diversity in old growth. We also predicted that patch size of stands should be influential. To test these predictions, we modeled counts of 79 bird species from 52 stands in 5 regions in the province of Ontario, Canada in relation to habitat at the local and landscape extents. Neither total species richness nor abundance differed between stand types. No significant difference was found in bird assemblages between stand types using ordination analysis. However, more Neotropical migrants were found in old-growth stands than in mature stands, while the reverse was true for short-distance migrants. Twenty-five species had higher counts in old-growth stands-three significantly so: Brown Creeper Certhia americana, Northern Parula Setophaga americana, and Scarlet Tanager Piranga olivacea. Supercanopy pine (¿ 60 cm dbh) was a significant (P ¡ 0.05) positive predictor for Black-throated Green Warbler Setophaga virens, Northern Parula, and total species richness, while medium/large pine (¿ 40 cm/dbh) was a significant positive predictor for Brown Creeper, Pine Warbler Setophaga pinus, and total species richness. The density of supercanopy and medium/large pine explained a small but significant amount of variation in bird assemblages (1\%), after considering age, other tree variables (9\%), and landscape metrics. Patch size was significant for Evening Grosbeak Coccothraustes vespertinus and total abundance. According to receiver operating characteristic (ROC) thresholds, Brown Creeper required a minimum of 62 stems/ha of medium/large pine. Pileated Woodpecker Dryocopus pileatus and Black-throated Green Warbler required a minimum of 14 and 23 stems/ha of supercanopy pine, respectively. Blackburnian Warbler Setophaga fusca required a minimum stand age of 66 years. Current targets in shelterwood seed cuts for pine appear to be just within range for Brown Creeper-at least for the first cut, but not for subsequent cuts. We recommend that forest management seek to emulate increased old-growth characteristics in a proportion of managed stands that fall within the range of variation expected under natural variation.},

We evaluated 2 potential band-tailed pigeon survey methods (auditory and call-broadcast surveys) from 2002 to 2004 in 5 mountain ranges in southern Arizona, USA, and in mixed-conifer forest throughout the state. Both auditory and call-broadcast surveys produced low numbers of cooing pigeons detected per survey route (x ¡= 0.67) and had relatively high temporal variance in average number of cooing pigeons detected during replicate surveys (CV ¿= 161\%). However, compared to auditory surveys, use of call-broadcast increased 1) the percentage of replicate surveys on which ¿= 1 cooing pigeon was detected by an average of 16\%, and 2) the number of cooing pigeons detected per survey route by an average of 29\%, with this difference being greatest during the first 45 minutes of the morning survey period. Moreover, probability of detecting a cooing pigeon was 27\% greater during call-broadcast (0.80) versus auditory (0.63) surveys. We found that cooing pigeons were most common in mixed-conifer forest in southern Arizona and density of male pigeons in mixed-conifer forest throughout the state averaged 0.004 (SE = 0.001) pigeons/ha. Our results are the first to show that call-broadcast increases the probability of detecting band-tailed pigeons (or any species of Columbidae) during surveys. Call-broadcast surveys may provide a useful method for monitoring populations of the interior subspecies of band-tailed pigeon in areas where other survey methods are inappropriate.},

We found that: (1) Overall bird abundance, but not richness, was significantly (p ¡ 0.05) higher on organic sites (mean 43.1 individuals per site) than nonorganic sites (35.8 individuals per site). Significantly more species of birds were observed for five guilds, including primary grassland birds, on organic vs. nonorganic sites. No guild had higher richness or abundance on nonorganic farms; (2) Farming practice models were the best (Delta AIC ¡ 4) for abundance of birds overall, primary grassland bird richness, sallier aerial insectivore richness and abundance, and abundance of ground nesters; (3) Habitat models were the best for overall richness, Neotropical migrant abundance, richness and abundance of Ontario-USA-Mexico (short-distance) migrants and resident richness; (4) Predation models were the best for richness of secondary grassland birds and ground feeders; (5) A combination of variables from the model types were best for richness or abundance overall, 13 of 18 guilds (richness and abundance) and 16 of 22 species analyzed. Five of 10 farming practice variables (including herbicide use, organic farm type) and 9 of 13 habitat variables (including hedgerow length, proportion of hay) were significant in best models. Risk modeling indicated that herbicide use could decrease primary grassland birds by one species (35\% decline from 3.4 to 2.3 species) per site. Organic farming could benefit species of conservation concern by 49\% (an increase from 7.6 to 11.4 grassland birds). An addition of 63 m of hedgerow could increase abundance and richness of short distance migrants by 50\% (3.0 to 4.8 and 1.3 to 2.0, respectively). Increasing the proportion of hay on nonorganic farms to 50\% could increase abundance of primary grassland bird by 40\% (6.7 to 9.4).

We compared breeding bird species composition and abundance on 10 farm pairs of each type matched at the site level for land cover in the prairie parklands of Saskatchewan, Canada in 1990. Land cover was measured around bird point counts at two extents; `site' (6.3 ha area) and `field' (16.3 ha area). We pooled species into functional groups; linear mixed models showed no significant differences between farm types for species richness but that all birds, migratory birds using crops and aerial insectivores were more abundant on organic farms. A permutational multivariate analysis of variance demonstrated that farm type did not have a significant overall effect on compositional similarity but that pairwise differences existed between about half of the farm pairs (the direction of differences in beta diversity was not consistent between organic and nonorganic fauns according to tests for the homogeneity of multivariate dispersions). Farm-pair differences were more pronounced for all birds and for migratory bird species using crops, migratory birds consuming grains and ground feeders, but not grassland birds. nMDS ordinations suggested that there was more variation in species composition and abundance on organic farms than nonorganic ones but the difference was not significant. Distance-based redundancy analysis (dbitDA) was used to examine the main drivers of bird species composition and abundance and to see which extent was most important; land cover at the field extent was more important than land cover at the site extent or the farming practices measured. The most important field-extent land cover was the amount of native grassland, woodland (including shelterbelts) and wetlands. After controlling for significant field-extent land cover, seed treatment, herbicide use, and number of passes were significant. At the site extent, greater non-crop heterogeneity had a significantly positive effect on abundance and species richness of several groups (e.g., grassland birds, migratory granivores, ground feeders, ground nesters) but a negative effect on richness of woodland birds and abundance of aerial insectivores. Relationships with crop heterogeneity were mostly negative and non-significant. Overall land cover heterogeneity at the site level was positively related to the richness of grassland birds. In contrast at the field extent, non-crop heterogeneity did not have any significant effects on the richness and abundance of any functional group. Crop heterogeneity had a significantly negative effect on aerial insectivore richness and abundance. In the early 1990s, differences in birds between organic and nonorganic farms in Saskatchewan were evident but subtle and variable among farms, and apparently most related to land cover-bird assemblage interactions/relationships.},

  abstract = {Wild birds are an important nonpoint source of fecal contamination of surface waters, but their contribution to fecal pollution is mostly difficult to estimate. Thus, to evaluate the relation between feces production and input of fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) into aquatic environments by wild waterfowl, we introduced a new holistic approach for evaluating the performance of FIB in six shallow saline habitats. For this, we monitored bird abundance, fecal pellet production, and the abundance of FIB concomitantly with a set of environmental variables over a 9-month period. For estimating fecal pellet production, a new protocol of fecal pellet counting was introduced, which was called fecal taxation (FTX). We could show that, over the whole range of investigated habitats, bird abundance, FTX values, and FIB abundance were highly significantly correlated and could demonstrate the good applicability of the FTX as a meaningful surrogate parameter for recent bird abundances and fecal contamination by birds in shallow aquatic ecosystems. Presumptive enterococci (ENT) were an excellent surrogate parameter of recent fecal contamination in these saline environments for samples collected at biweekly to monthly sampling intervals while presumptive Escherichia coli and fecal coliforms (FC) were often undetectable. Significant negative correlations with salinity indicated that E. coli and FC survival was hampered by osmotic stress. Statistical analyses further revealed that fecal pollution-associated parameters represented one system component independent from other environmental variables and that, besides feces production, rainfall, total suspended solids (direct), and trophy (indirect) had significant positive effects on ENT concentrations. Our holistic approach of linking bird abundance, feces production, and FIB detection with environmental variables may serve as a powerful model for application to other aquatic ecosystems.},

More efficient methods would be of considerable value to managers and conservationists. Here we assess a method that has been neglected in this context. We examine and compare distance-based visual detection line-transects and conventional fixed-width transects for assessing a distinctive low abundance species of conservation significance, Myrianthus holstii Engl., in three separate areas, within a steep, disturbed mountain rain forest. Precision and implied accuracy appeared substantially better with the visual detection line-transect than with the fixed-width transect for equivalent costs and effort at all three landscapes but as the two methods provide different estimates there are questions of possible bias in both approaches. We discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the distance approach and suggest some recommendations concerning its application. We conclude that the distance method is suited to low density species that are easily identified, even when understorey vegetation and terrain severely impair visibility. However, due to the differences in detection probabilities, populations need to be stratified both by tree size and context. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Point counts are the method most commonly used to estimate abundance of birds, but they often fail to account properly for incomplete and variable detection probabilities. We developed a technique that combines distance and double-observer sampling to estimate detection probabilities and effective area surveyed. We applied this paired-observer, variable circular-plot (POVCP) technique to point-count surveys (n = 753) conducted in closed-canopy forests of southeast Alaska. Distance data were analyzed for each species to model a detection probability for each observer and calculate an estimate of density. We then multiplied each observer's density estimates by a correction factor to adjust for detection probabilities ¡ 1 at plot center. We compared analytical results from four survey methods: single-observer fixed-radius (50-m) plot; single-observer, variable circular-plot (SOVCP); double-observer fixed-radius (50-m) plot; and POVCP. We examined differences in detection probabilities at plot center, effective area surveyed, and densities for five bird species: Pacific-slope Flycatcher (Empidonax difficilis), Winter Wren (Troglodytes troglodytes), Golden-crowned Kinglet (Regulus satrapa), Hermit Thrush (Catharus guttatus), and Townsend's Warbler (Dendroica townsendi). Average detection probabilities for paired observers increased similar to 8\% (SE = 2.9) for all species once estimates were corrected for birds missed at plot center. Density estimators of fixed-radius survey methods were likely negatively biased, because the key assumption of perfect detection was not met. Density estimates generated using SOVCP and POVCP were similar, but standard errors were much lower for the POVCP survey method. We recommend using POVCP when study objectives require precise estimates of density. Failure to account for differences in detection probabilities and effective area surveyed results in biased population estimators and, therefore, faulty inferences about the population in question.},

The subject of interest is focused on matrix algebraic properties of the Fisher information matrix (FIM) of stationary processes. The FIM is an ingredient of the Crame´r-Rao inequality, and belongs to the basics of asymptotic estimation theory in mathematical statistics. The FIM is interconnected with the Sylvester, Bezout and tensor Sylvester matrices. Through these interconnections it is shown that the FIM of scalar and multiple stationary processes fulfill the resultant matrix property. A statistical distance measure involving entries of the FIM is presented. In quantum information, a different statistical distance measure is set forth. It is related to the Fisher information but where the information about one parameter in a particular measurement procedure is considered. The FIM of scalar stationary processes is also interconnected to the solutions of appropriate Stein equations, conditions for the FIM to verify certain Stein equations are formulated. The presence of Vandermonde matrices is also emphasized.},

  abstract = {Line-transect distance sampling is widely used to estimate population densities using distances of observed targets from transect lines to model detectability. When the target taxa are high density, the frequent measuring of distances may make the method seem impractical. We present a method that improves the efficiency of distance sampling when the target species occurs at high density. Only a proportion of targets are measured to model the detection function, and the time saved on the survey is then used to cover a longer total length of transect and accrue a larger ‘count only’ sample. This approach can improve the precision of the population density estimate when the cost of measuring the distance to a detected target is more than half the cost of walking to the next target. We find the optimal proportion of distances to measure that minimises the variance of the density estimate for a fixed survey budget. We quantify how much this optimised strategy increases the precision of the density estimate compared with conventional line-transect distance sampling. We then use simulated distance sampling data to test our expressions, and illustrate circumstances under which the optimised approach would be beneficial using distance sampling data on high-density plants. The simulations indicate that the optimised method delivers benefits in precision, but the magnitude of the benefit is lower than predicted from our expressions, which are based on an asymptotic approximation of the variance. We apply an adjustment to the predicted benefit equation to account for this difference, and show that, in all three plant case studies, the optimised approach could improve the precision gained from a distance sampling survey between 20\% and 50\%. This new approach could broaden the ecological contexts in which distance sampling is applied, to include estimation of densities of abundant taxa where plots are conventionally used. The method may have interesting applications for other survey types, including multispecies surveys or those using cues or signs that occur at high density.},

We situate this within the context of approaches to reserve management in Tanzania, where state-managed Forest Reserves have received little in terms of funding support and score lowest when compared with all other management types in Tanzania. Further, we show that slightly higher average METT scores for sites where WWF are working across Kenya, Tanzania and Mozambique, when compared with all other sites, are most pronounced in elements of the METT tool relating to inputs, process and planning, and are not seen in outputs or outcomes. We discuss the utility of the METT tool for organisations like WWF to evaluate their impact in protected area management, including the issue of systematic bias in data recording (WWF facilitation of assessments) and that more time may be required to see the outcomes and impacts from any management improvements that have been achieved.},

However, how much sampling area is enough for biodiversity monitoring in riparian area, the ecotone among freshwater and terrestrial system? Whether the optimal sampling areas are different among ecoregions? To explore these scientific questions, the minimum sampling area of riparian herbs was studied in Taizi river, Liaoning province, China. The species-area relationship was modeled using average species richness in the same area (2.25, 4.5, 6.75 and 9 m(2)) of 55 sites distributed along riparian zone of Taizi river water course. The power model S = aA (b) modeled best, and was selected to fit species-area curves. The minimum sampling areas for total species and dominant families were calculated via the selected model and corresponding estimated species richness. Results showed that the minimum sampling areas (MSAs) for herbs diversity monitoring in whole basin, highland ecoregion, midland ecoregion and lowland ecoregion of Taizi river were 12.82, 12.06, 13.46 and 13.08 m(2),respectively. The MSAs of dominant families Compositae species and Graminale species were similar to that of total species. The minimum sampling area of Taizi river riparian zone was similar to other temperate riparian grassland and wet grassland, larger than dry grassland and salt meadow. So we did not need consider ecoregion difference for temperate riparian herbs diversity monitoring in watershed scale.},

  abstract = {Probability of detection and accuracy of distance estimates in aural avian surveys may be affected by the presence of anthropogenic noise, and this may lead to inaccurate evaluations of the effects of noisy infrastructure on wildlife. We used arrays of speakers broadcasting recordings of grassland bird songs and pure tones to assess the probability of detection, and localization accuracy, by observers at sites with and without noisy oil and gas infrastructure in south-central Alberta from 2012 to 2014. Probability of detection varied with species and with speaker distance from transect line, but there were few effects of noisy infrastructure. Accuracy of distance estimates for songs and tones decreased as distance to observer increased, and distance estimation error was higher for tones at sites with infrastructure noise. Our results suggest that quiet to moderately loud anthropogenic noise may not mask detection of bird songs; however, errors in distance estimates during aural surveys may lead to inaccurate estimates of avian densities calculated using distance sampling. We recommend caution when applying distance sampling if most birds are unseen, and where ambient noise varies among treatments.},

To quantify avian response patterns along a burn severity gradient, we sampled 49 random plots ( 2001 - 2002) at the 17351- ha Cerro Grande Fire ( 2000) in New Mexico, USA. Additionally, pre-. re avian surveys ( 1986 1988, 1990) created a unique opportunity to quantify avifaunal changes in 13 pre-. re transects ( resampled in 2002) and to compare two designs for analyzing the effects of unplanned disturbances: after- only analysis and before - after comparisons. Distance analysis was used to calculate densities. We analyzed after- only densities for 21 species using gradient analysis, which detected a broad range of responses to increasing burn severity: (I) large significant declines, (II) weak, but signi. cant declines, (III) no signi. cant density changes, (IV) peak densities in low- or moderate- severity patches, (V) weak, but signi. cant increases, and (VI) large signi. cant increases. Overall, 71\% of the species included in the after- only gradient analysis exhibited either positive or neutral density responses to. re effects across all or portions of the severity gradient ( responses III - VI). We used pre/ post pairs analysis to quantify density changes for 15 species using before - after comparisons; spatiotemporal variation in densities was large and confounded. re effects for most species. Only four species demonstrated signi. cant effects of burn severity, and their densities were all higher in burned compared to unburned forests. Pre- and post-. re community similarity was high except in high- severity areas. Species richness was similar pre- and post-. re across all burn severities. Thus, ecosystem restoration programs based on the assumption that recent severe. res in Southwestern ponderosa pine forests have overriding negative ecological effects are not supported by our study of post-. re avian communities. This study illustrates the importance of quantifying burn severity and controlling confounding sources of spatiotemporal variation in studies of. re effects.

Observers are typically limited to search within 5 or 10 m from the line, while observers are unrestricted in larger specified search regions in area surveys. Although methods differ slightly, the selection is often based on producing defendable data for conservation, maximizing data quality, and minimizing effort. To guide method selection, we compared butterfly surveys using 1) line versus area methods and 2) varying width transects (5 m, 10 m, or unrestricted) using count data from surveys in North Dakota from 2015 to 2018. Between line and area surveys, we detected more individuals with area surveys, even when accounting for effort. However, both methods accumulated new species at similar rates. When comparing transect methodology, we detected nearly 60\% more individuals and nine more species when transect width increased from 5 m to unrestricted, despite similar effort across methodology. Overall, we found line surveys slightly less efficient at detecting individuals, but they collected similar species richness to area surveys when accounting for effort. Additionally, line surveys allow the use of unrestricted-width transects with distance sampling procedures, which were more effective at detecting species and individuals while providing a means to correct count data over the same transect length. Methods that reduce effort and accurately depict communities are especially important for conservation when long-term datasets are unavailable.},

  abstract = {Butterflies are consistently the focus of conservation research because they contribute to ecosystem services, act as biological indicators, and are in decline worldwide. Land managers and researchers use many methods to measure butterfly populations, but this creates issues for standardization and production of comparative, rigorous data. To promote methods more appropriate for research-based conservation, we conducted a literature review focusing on the implementation and advancement of butterfly monitoring methods over time. We identified four main methods that are most frequently used in butterfly research and monitoring: (1) trapping and netting, (2) mark-recapture, (3) transects (Pollard walks), and (4) distance sampling. Although a progression of method development has occurred over time, all methods are still currently used in butterfly research, with trapping, netting, and mark-recapture used in 85\% of studies. Over the last century, the amount of butterfly research has steadily increased, so it is vital to select methods that produce accurate, and comparable data. However, we found that method selection was not solely based on the type of data needed for accurate interpretation and extrapolation of results. Instead, land context, species abundance, and historically-used methods are driving method selection. As butterflies remain a high conservation priority, researchers must provide rigorous data that are necessary for creating effective conservation plans and policies by using a framework for method selection.},

Montagu's Harrier Circus pygargus is a farmland raptor of high conservation concern and threatened by agricultural intensification. However, within many European countries, including Poland, the status of this species remains unknown or questionable and information on its breeding is incomplete or imprecise. Here, we estimate the size of the national population of the Montagu's Harrier and argue that using data from multiple sources may help to design national bird surveys and better contribute to identifying population trends. We built a predictive model based on a presence-absence data obtained by volunteer-based citizen-science projects conducted in Poland during 2000-2012. Afterwards, from the set of 10 km x 10 km squares of high predicted habitat suitability, 100 sampling plots were randomly chosen and regularly surveyed by experienced ornithologists in 2013 and 2014. The evaluation of fieldwork efficiency by the double-observer approach allowed detectability to be estimated and accounted for while estimating population size. We estimated the Polish Montagu's Harrier population at almost 3,400 breeding pairs (95\% CI: 2,700-4,300), thus constituting 20\% of the European Union (EU) population. Furthermore, we showed that public-gathered data originating from multiple sources offered great potential for regular surveys to obtain large-scale estimates of population size.},

  abstract = {Large-mammal surveys often rely on indirect signs such as dung or nests. Sign density is usually translated into animal density using sign production and decay rates. In principle, such auxiliary variable estimates should be made in a spatially unbiased manner. However, traditional decay rate estimation methods entail following many signs from production to disappearance, which, in large study areas, requires extensive travel effort. Consequently, decay rate estimates have tended to be made instead at some convenient but unrepresentative location. In this study we evaluated how much bias might be induced by extrapolating decay rates from unrepresentative locations, how much effort would be required to implement current methods in a spatially unbiased manner, and what alternate approaches might be used to improve precision. To evaluate the extent of bias induced by unrepresentative sampling, we collected data on gorilla dung at several central African sites. Variation in gorilla dung decay rate was enormous, varying by up to an order of magnitude within and between survey zones. We then estimated what the effort-precision relationship would be for a previously suggested "retrospective'' decay rate (RDR) method, if it were implemented in a spatially unbiased manner. We also evaluated precision for a marked sign count (MSC) approach that does not use a decay rate. Because they require repeat visits to remote locations, both RDR and MSC require enormous effort levels in order to gain precise density estimates. Finally, we examined an objective criterion for decay (i.e.,dung height). This showed great potential for improving RDR efficiency because choosing a high threshold height for decay reduces decay time and, consequently, the number of visits that need to be made to remote areas. The ability to adjust decay time using an objective decay criterion also opens up the potential for a "prospective'' decay rate (PDR) approach. Further research is necessary to evaluate whether the temporal bias inherent in such an approach is small enough to ignore, given the 10 -20-fold increases in precision promised by a PDR approach.},

  abstract = {Global climate warming is predicted to lead to global and regional changes in the distribution of organisms. One influential approach to test this prediction using temporally repeated mapping surveys of organisms was suggested in a seminal paper by Thomas \& Lennon (1999, Nature). The Thomas \& Lennon approach corrects observed changes in the range margin for changes in the range size, and thus potentially controls for other broad-scale environmental changes between surveys, however the approach does not necessarily account for potential biases in sampling effort. To verify whether the issue of variation in sampling effort affects empirical estimates of shifts in range margin, we reanalyzed all three published studies exploring range margin changes of breeding birds in Great Britain (GB), Finland, and New York State (NY). Accounting for changes in survey effort on range margins lowered the estimated shift for breeding birds in New York, but the shift remained statistically significant. For Great Britain and Finland, for which no direct estimate of survey effort is available, we used species richness (a strong correlate of survey effort in New York) as a proxy and found that in both cases the estimated shift in range margin was significantly reduced and became nonsignificant. To understand how robust the approach is to sampling biases, we use a simulation model to show that the Thomas \& Lennon approach is, under certain conditions, sensitive to changes in detection probability (probability to detect true occupancy) which in turn may be affected by changes in surveying effort between surveys. We thus found evidence that temporal changes in the distribution of breeding birds based on repeated mapping surveys may be inflated by changes in survey effort along range boundaries. We discuss possible approaches to deal with this issue in the analysis and design of national or regional surveys.},

By tracking groups of harbor porpoise from land, we estimated the proportion of time harbor porpoise spent at the surface and the probability that aerial observers detected groups within 200 m of the transect line. Two teams on land, equipped with electronic theodolites, tracked harbor porpoise while surveys were conducted from an aircraft equipped with side-bubble windows and a belly window. During 7 days, 33 hours of observation were made in a high-density area for harbor porpoise near Orcas Island, Washington. We monitored 7 different harbor porpoise groups from 15 to 66 minutes each. The average proportion of time at or near the surface was 0.231 (SE = 0.032). From a selected sample of 164 land-based sightings of harbor porpoise groups, 50 (30.5\%) were observed from the aircraft. For our aerial line transect surveys of harbor porpoise conducted by experienced observers, ĝ(0) = 0.292 (SE = 0.107). However, for the inexperienced observers, ĝ(0) was 0.079 (SE = 0.046), which demonstrates the importance of experience and training.},

Field inventories, based on reliable presence/absence observations, are urgently needed to improve their protection. Such observations should be comparable between sites and collected with minimal surveying effort. Here, we demonstrate a strategy that minimises sampling effort while maximising inventory efficiency, formulated using hydromorphological data from 26 river sites sampled in north-eastern France between 2009 and 2010. Our findings indicate that a comprehensive visual survey of seven x river width with a bathyscope confirmed unionid presence in 96 \% of cases, and presence of all unionid species in 88 \% of cases. A further seven x width search increased this latter figure to 96 \%, while a third (=21 x width) ensured that all species were registered in all rivers surveyed. Based on these results, we recommend that surveyors first undertake an initial seven x river width visual survey to confirm unionid presence. If no Unionidae are observed over this distance, sampling ceases and the site is marked negative. If at least one Unionidae is observed over this distance, an additional upstream stretch of the same length is surveyed with identical sampling effort. If at least one new species is observed within this second stretch, then a third and final stretch can be surveyed. This method is discussed in the light of representativeness of hydromorphological habitats (e.g. pool spacing and meander wavelength).},

In particular, population assessment via conventional distance sampling (CDS) at landscape scales is challenging and often discarded for its high costs. The development of a framework for its methodological optimization is mandatory. To tackle this issue, we used survey simulations. For arbitrary-distributed populations, we compared the following: (i) systematic random transect allocation, (ii) random selection of footpaths, and (iii) two-stage sampling selection of footpaths (2, 5, 10 blocks). The performance of two-stage sampling and random footpath selection estimators was similar. Then, we applied previous results to estimate the size of a red deer (Cervus elaphus) population in the Italian Apennines. Using data from a pilot survey, we estimated density via CDS and density surface modeling (DSM), and we quantified survey costs per unit effort. Considering our deer distribution, we finally simulated and evaluated the cost-effectiveness of the abovementioned designs for a range of realistic efforts (25-65 transects). CDS produced a negatively biased and less precise estimate than the corresponding DSM. For an effort of 65 transects, design (ii) estimates were unbiased (coefficient of variation= 0.31), while design (iii) provided negatively biased estimates (coefficient of variation= 0.27). Two-stage sampling designs with few blocks were less expensive than other designs in attaining the same level of precision, and they emerged as a cost-effective survey design. Our simulation approach thus provided managers a readily available tool to improve the estimate of ungulate abundances at a landscape scale.},

Thus, there is a need to accurately and efficiently identify hotspots of road-mortality for hazard assessment and mitigation. In 2002, we conducted walking and driving surveys throughout an extensive rural highway network in northern New York, USA, to evaluate survey methods and to quantify spatial and temporal patterns of herpetofauna road-mortality. In 2004, we repeated the surveys at a subset of locations to quantify interannual repeatability. Reptile and amphibian species had different peak periods of road-mortality because they differed in the causes of movements that resulted in crossings. Spatial locations of herpetofauna road-mortality were concentrated at a limited number of hotspots. Hotspots overlapped across species and were located at consistent locations across years. Results of walking and driving surveys were highly repeatable among survey teams, but driving surveys underestimated the density of road-mortality because many animals were missed. Detection failure was higher in some taxa (e.g., frogs) than others (e.g., turtles). Our results indicate that it is possible to design a valid, efficient methodology for locating hotspots of reptile and amphibian road-mortality along a road network and, thus, pinpoint priority sites for mitigation.},

Knowing what causes such bias can help guide the collection of relevant survey covariates, correct the survey data, anticipate situations where bias might be unacceptably large, and elucidate the ecology of target species. We used negative binomial regression to evaluate confounding variables for gecko (primarily Hemidactylus frenatus and Lepidodactylus lugubris) counts on 220-m-long transects surveyed at night, primarily for snakes, on 9,475 occasions. Searchers differed in gecko detection rates by up to a factor of six. The worst and best headlamps differed by a factor of at least two. Strong winds had a negative effect potentially as large as those of searchers or headlamps. More geckos were seen during wet weather conditions, but the effect size was small. Compared with a detection nadir during waxing gibbous (nearly full) moons above the horizon, we saw 28\% more geckos during waning crescent moons below the horizon. A sine function suggested that we saw 24\% more geckos at the end of the wet season than at the end of the dry season. Fluctuations on a longer timescale also were verified. Disturbingly, corrected data exhibited strong short-term fluctuations that covariates apparently failed to capture. Although some biases can be addressed with measured covariates, others will be difficult to eliminate as a significant source of error in long-term monitoring programs.},

Because sea ice loss is expected to be accompanied by declines in krill and fish predators, decoupling the effects of climate and anthropogenic changes on these predator populations is crucial for ecosystem-based management of the Southern Ocean. We reviewed research published from 2007 to 2014 that incorporated very high-resolution satellite imagery to assess distribution, abundance, and effects of climate and other anthropogenic changes on populations of predators in polar regions. Very high-resolution imagery has been used to study 7 species of polar animals in 13 papers, many of which provide methods through which further research can be conducted. Use of very high-resolution imagery in the Southern Ocean can provide a broader understanding of climate and anthropogenic forces on populations and inform management and conservation recommendations. We recommend that conservation biologists continue to integrate high-resolution remote sensing into broad-scale biodiversity and population studies in remote areas, where it can provide much needed detail.

Ya que se espera que la perdida de hielo este acompanada por declinaciones de depredadores de peces y kril, desacoplar los efectos de los cambios climaticos y antropogenicos de estas poblaciones de depredadores es crucial para el manejo basado en ecosistemas del Oceano Antartico.

For example, big data have been used to study and model bird diversity and distributions across space and time, explore the patterns and determinants of broad-scale migration strategies, and examine the dynamics and mechanisms associated with geographic and phenological responses to global change. The application of big data also holds a number of challenges wherein high data volume and dimensionality can result in noise accumulation, spurious correlations, and incidental endogeneity. In total, big data resources continue to add empirical breadth and detail to ornithology, often at very broad spatial extents, but how the challenges underlying this approach can best be mitigated to maximize inferential quality and rigor needs to be carefully considered.},

  abstract = {Remote sensing-assisted estimates of aboveground forest biomass are essential for modeling carbon budgets. It has been suggested that estimates can be improved by building species- or strata-specific biomass models. However, few studies have attempted a systematic analysis of the benefits of such stratification, especially in combination with other factors such as sensor type, statistical prediction method and sampling design of the reference inventory data. We addressed this topic by analyzing the impact of stratifying forest data into three classes (broadleaved, coniferous and mixed forest). We compare predictive accuracy (a) between the strata (b) to a case without stratification for a set of preselected predictors from airborne LiDAR and hyperspectral data obtained in a managed mixed forest site in southwestern Germany. We used 5 commonly applied algorithms for biomass predictions on bootstrapped subsamples of the data to obtain cross validated RMSE and r2 diagnostics. Those values were analyzed in a factorial design by an analysis of variance (ANOVA) to rank the relative importance of each factor. Selected models were used for wall-to-wall mapping of biomass estimates and their associated uncertainty. The results revealed marginal advantages for the strata-specific prediction models over the unstratified ones, which were more obvious on the wall-to-wall mapped area-based predictions. Yet further tests are necessary to establish the generality of these results. Input data type and statistical prediction method are concluded to remain the two most crucial factors for the quality of remote sensingassisted biomass models.},

The surface abundance was estimated for the Pelagos Sanctuary for Mediterranean Marine Mammals in the summer of 2009 (n=1152; 95\%CI=669.0-1981.0; \%CV=27.64), the Sea of Sardinia, the Pelagos Sanctuary and the Central Tyrrhenian Sea for the summer of 2010 (n=3401; 95\% CI=2067.0-5596.0; \%CV=25.51), and for the Southern. Tyrrhenian Sea during the winter months of 2010-2011 (n=1228; 95\%CI=578-2605; \%CV=38.59). The Mediterranean swordfish stock deserves special attention in light of the heavy fishing pressures. Furthermore, the unreliability of fishery-related data has, to date, hampered our ability to effectively inform long-term conservation in the Mediterranean Region. Considering that the European countries have committed to protect the resources and all the marine-related economic and social dynamics upon which they depend, the information presented here constitute useful data towards the international legal requirements under the Marine Strategy Framework Directory, the Common Fisheries Policy, the Habitats and Species Directive and the Directive on Maritime Spatial Planning, among the others.},

  abstract = {Monitoring of threatened species is a critical part of conserving biodiversity. It is needed to understand popu­ lation trajectories, threatening processes, and the type and effectiveness of management responses needed to ensure persistence and recovery. Characteristics of some plant species (e.g. immobility) should render them amenable to monitoring, whereas other characteristics (e.g. ephemeral life histories) will make plant monitoring challenging. We evaluated monitoring adequacy and extent for a large sample (839 taxa) of Australia's threat­ ened plants (1336 taxa) and compared this assessment with a similar evaluation for threatened vertebrates. We found 37.2\% of threatened plants are monitored, half the rate found for vertebrates. For monitored plants, monitoring quality as assessed using a set of nine criteria was generally low, similar to results for vertebrates. Plants with more imperilled conservation status were more likely to be monitored and tended to have higher quality monitoring. Plants with recovery plans were more likely to be monitored than those without. The like­ lihood a species was monitored decreased the longer a taxon had been listed under threatened species legislation. Monitoring longevity was poor but inclusion of demographic data and linkages to management were better than for vertebrates. Our assessment highlighted a lack of collated monitoring data for plants, and we recognise there are exemplary programs for threatened plants that can guide improvements in monitoring for other species. Plants are overwhelmingly represented in threatened species lists worldwide and a determined focus to improve the extent and quality of plant monitoring should underpin biodiversity conservation targets.},

  abstract = {Ecological and economic evaluation should be a key component of biodiversity conservation programmes since it underpins the efficient allocation of resources. However, most such programmes are not currently assessed in terms of the rate of return on investment that they provide. The UK Government launched the UK Biodiversity Action Plan in 1994. We collected data from those responsible for monitoring this programme, then used a form of cost-effectiveness analysis to evaluate its effectiveness and efficiency at meeting the targets of individual Species Action Plans. In this context, effectiveness refers to the goal of maximising total conservation gains, whereas efficiency refers to maximising conservation gain per unit cost. We define the latter as a basic economic objective for conservation resource allocation. We find that the distribution of spending across plans was highly biased towards vertebrates and there was no correlation between cost and effectiveness. Non-vertebrate plans tended to be more efficient than vertebrate plans. However, following a species utility-based weighting, this tendency was less pronounced and a significant positive correlation between cost and effectiveness emerged. Nevertheless, this evidence suggests that the efficiency of the UK Biodiversity Action Plan could be improved by correcting the imbalance in spending between vertebrate and non-vertebrate plans. This study highlights the importance of effective monitoring and reporting in determining the utility of biodiversity conservation programmes. It demonstrates how explicit cost-effectiveness analysis can be used to evaluate such programmes, and shows that it could also be adapted to accommodate other forms of ecological and social value.

We developed multi-scale, seasonal models to explore how local resource selection by the threatened forest-dwelling woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) was influenced by both broad-scale landscape context and local resource heterogeneity in the intensively managed region of Charlevoix, Qu,bec, Canada, located on the southern border of the North American caribou range. We estimated resource selection functions using 23 GPS-collared caribou monitored from 2004 to 2006 and landscape data on vegetation classes, terrain conditions, and roads. We found evidence of thresholds in road “proximity” effects (up to 1.25 km), which underscores the importance of including landscape context variables in addition to locally measured variables, and of fitting seasonal-specific models given temporal variation in the magnitude of selection and optimal scale of measurement. Open lichen woodlands were an important cover type for caribou during winter and spring, whereas deciduous forests, wetlands, and even young disturbed stands became important during calving and summer. Caribou consistently avoided roads and rugged terrain conditions at both local and landscape levels. Landscape context fundamentally constrains the choices available to animals, and we showed that failing to consider landscape context, or arbitrarily choosing an inappropriate scale for measuring covariates, may provide biased inferences with respect to habitat selection patterns. Effective habitat management for rare or declining species should carefully consider the hierarchical nature of habitat selection.},

Density was consistently included across models and the best predictor when used alone in a validation exercise. We then calculated mean reporting rates for the citizen science South African Bird Atlas Project2 (SABAP2). A model of species' reporting rates as determined by density for this set of birds suggested the correlation between atlas reporting rates and density estimates was weak, with species capable of using modified habitats exhibiting higher reporting rates than expected from the density estimates. There was a positive correlation between bird density and reporting rates corrected for by species mass. We used this relationship to calculate densities for the Fynbos bird species and compare results to published data.},

These require a constant supply of resources, the level of which is determined by the concern of the society about biodiversity conservation. In this paper, we study the optimal fraction of the resources to invest in activities for enhancing the social concern y (t) by environmental education, museum displays, publications, and media exposure. We search for the strategy that maximizes the time-integral of the quality of the conservation area x (t) with temporal discounting. Analyses based on dynamic programming and Pontryagin's maximum principle show that the optimal control consists of two phases: (1) in the first phase, the social concern level approaches to the final optimal value y*, (2) in the second phase, resources are allocated to both activities, and the social concern level is kept constant y (t) = y*. If the social concern starts from a low initial level, the optimal path includes a period in which the quality of the conservation area declines temporarily, because all the resources are invested to enhance the social concern. When the support rate increases with the quality of the conservation area itself x (t) as well as with the level of social concern y (t), both variables may increase simultaneously in the second phase. We discuss the implication of the results to good management of biodiversity conservation areas. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

With the aim of developing a standardised method of surveying parrots in the rainforests of New Caledonia, we used distance sampling to estimate densities of New Caledonian Parakeets (Cyanoramphus saisseti), Horned Parakeets (Eunymphicus cornutus), Ouvea Parakeets (E. uvaeensis), and New Caledonian Rainbow Lorikeets (Trichoglossus haematodus deplanchii). We carried out surveys in the early morning and late afternoon, when parrots were easiest to detect. To minimise errors associated with estimating distances and flock sizes by ear, we conducted brief searches to locate parrots, then measured their distance from the transect line. We recorded birds in flight and consider these records to be important when estimating parakeet populations. In agreement with existing knowledge on distance sampling, we found line transects to be more efficient than point transects for estimating the density of parakeets. Our results indicate that parrots located beyond 50-70 m from the transect line have little influence upon density estimates. In addition, surveys on roads are likely to underestimate densities if not corrected for road width. We generated relatively stable and precise density estimates (CV {$<$} 0.25) with approximately 40-50 detections, yet additional effort may be warranted under different study conditions. Although we aimed to improve parrot surveys in New Caledonia, our suggestions may be useful to other researchers studying rainforest birds, and can be adapted to suit different species or environments.},

  abstract = {In ecological field surveys, observations are gathered at different spatial locations. The purpose may be to relate biological response variables (e.g., species abundances) to explanatory environmental variables (e.g., soil characteristics). In the absence of prior knowledge, ecologists have been taught to rely on systematic or random sampling designs. If there is prior knowledge about the spatial patterning of the explanatory variables, obtained from either previous surveys or a pilot study, can we use this information to optimize the sampling design in order to maximize our ability to detect the relationships between the response and explanatory variables? The specific questions addressed in this paper are: a) What is the effect (type I error) of spatial autocorrelation on the statistical tests commonly used by ecologists to analyse field survey data? b) Can we eliminate, or at least minimize, the effect of spatial autocorrelation by the design of the survey? Are there designs that provide greater power for surveys, at least under certain circumstances? c) Can we eliminate or control for the effect of spatial autocorrelation during the analysis? To answer the last question, we compared regular regression analysis to a modified t-test developed by Dutilleul for correlation coefficients in the presence of spatial autocorrelation. Replicated surfaces (typically, 1000 of them) were simulated using different spatial parameters, and these surfaces were subjected to different sampling designs and methods of statistical analysis. The simulated surfaces may represent, for example, vegetation response to underlying environmental variation. This allowed us 1) to measure the frequency of type I error (the failure to reject the null hypothesis when in fact there is no effect of the environment on the response variable) and 2) to estimate the power of the different combinations of sampling designs and methods of statistical analysis (power is measured by the rate of rejection of the null hypothesis when an effect of the environment on the response variable has been created). Our results indicate that: 1) Spatial autocorrelation in both the response and environmental variables affects the classical tests of significance of correlation or regression coefficients. Spatial autocorrelation in only one of the two variables does not affect the test of significance. 2) A broad-scale spatial structure present in data has the same effect on the tests as spatial autocorrelation. When such a structure is present in one of the variables and autocorrelation is found in the other, or in both, the tests of significance have inflated rates of type I error. 3) Dutilleul's modified t-test for the correlation coefficient, corrected for spatial autocorrelation, effectively corrects for spatial autocorrelation in the data. It also effectively corrects for the presence of deterministic structures, with or without spatial autocorrelation. The presence of a broad-scale deterministic structure may, in some cases, reduce the power of the modified t-test.},

  abstract = {We systematically reviewed the raptor electrocution literature to evaluate study designs and methods used in raptor electrocution research, mitigation, and monitoring, emphasizing original research published in English. Specifically, we wondered if three decades of effort to reduce raptor electrocutions has had positive effects. The majority of literature examined came from North America, western Europe, and South Africa. In spite of intensive and often sustained effort by industry and governments across three continents for 30 years, reductions in the incidence of electrocution have been demonstrated in only a few studies. Reliable rate estimates of electrocution mortality generally are unavailable, with some exceptions. Nearly half of 110 studies we analyzed in detail were retrospective reviews of historical mortality records, banding data, or results of necropsies on dead birds received at pathology and veterinary facilities. Among prospective studies, less than half used unbiased approaches to sampling and many did not provide enough detail to assess the sampling design used. At this time, few researchers can demonstrate the reliability of standardized retrofitting procedures or the effectiveness of monitoring techniques. Future progress in reducing raptor mortalities on power lines will benefit from properly designed studies that generate rate estimates of mortality, address biasing factors, and include predictions concerning risk and techniques to reduce risk that can be tested in the field or laboratory.

  abstract = {Researchers and wildlife managers strive for low bias and high precision (i.e. high accuracy) when estimating animal population sizes. Distance sampling is currently one of the most widely used monitoring methods. However, it relies on strict sampling designs and modeling assumptions that can be difficult to meet in the field. Here, we use data from two sub-populations of non-migratory wild Svalbard reindeer Rangifer tarandus platyrhynchus inhabiting flat, open and isolated coastal tundra plains, to demonstrate some challenges related to the distance sampling methodology. To achieve this, we compared distance sampling line transect estimates with repeated total population counts and combined available software tools (R packages unmarked, Distance and dsm) to fulfill the analytical requirements of small study sites in which large areas are surveyed relative to the study area size. Based on low variation among repeated total counts (CV = 0.02 - 0.06) and the virtual absence of false negatives and positives of marked animals, the total counts could be used as reference population sizes. Distance sampling estimates were not statistically different from the total count estimates. Our relatively large sample size of 143 observations enabled precise distance sampling abundance estimates (CV = 0.16 - 0.26) compared with other studies in the wild. However, capturing the processes shaping population dynamics would likely require even higher sampling effort or other, more resource demanding monitoring tools, such as total counts or mark-recapture. In this type of ecosystem, distance sampling nevertheless represents a cost-effective tool suitable for ‘population state’ assessment and studies of large-scale spatial distribution patterns. Our study stresses the importance of choosing the appropriate analytical tools and estimating the accuracy of the monitoring methods that are used to achieve specific scientific, management or conservation goals.},

Mark-recapture techniques are regarded as the gold standard for estimating abundance but can be financially or logistically prohibitive. Recent developments in remote camera analytical approaches have provided alternative methods to estimate unmarked populations efficiently but have undergone limited field testing. In September and October 2020, I assessed 2 camera methods that use the same set of time-lapse photographs; a space to event (STE) model and instantaneous sampling (IS), applied to a case study of feral sheep (Ovis aries) at the US Army's Pōhakuloa Training Area (PTA) on Hawai`i Island. Results of the camera methods were compared to an abundance estimate calculated from an aerial distance sampling survey completed concurrently with camera sampling. A comparison of confidence intervals indicated no statistical difference between estimates, but the relative imprecision of IS suggested the STE model to be a more reliable estimator. The cost of camera sampling was approximately 3 times that of the aerial survey, but camera sampling became more economical if the area was resurveyed 3 or more times. My study showed the STE model to be a cost effective, practical abundance estimator of feral sheep when compared to well-established aerial distance sampling techniques, and therefore should offer considerable potential for the conservation and management of other easily identifiable species.},

  abstract = {Patterns of association between humans and biodiversity typically show positive, negative, or negative quadratic relationships and can be described by 3 hypotheses: biologically rich areas that support high human population densities co-occur with arc-as of high biodiversity (productivity); biodiversity decreases monotonically with increasing human activities (ecosystem stress); and biodiversity peaks at intermediate levels of human influence (intermediate disturbance). To test these hypothese, we compared anthropogenic land cover and housing units, as indices of human influence, with bird species richness and abundance across the Midwestern United States. We modeled richness of native birds with 12 candidate models of land cover and housing to evaluate the empirical evidence. To assess which species were responsible for observed variation in richness, we repeated our model-selection analysis with relative abundance of each native species as the response and then asked whether natural-history traits were associated with positive, negative, or mixed responses. Native avian richness was highest where anthropogenic land cover was lowest and housing units were intermediate based on model-averaged predictions among a confidence set of candidate models. Eighty-three of 132 species showed some pattern of association with our measures of human influence. Of these species approximately 40\% were negatively associated, approximately 6\% were positively associated, and approximately 7\% showed evidence of an intermediate relationship with human influence measures, Natural-history traits were not closely related to the direction of the relationship between abundance and human influence. Nevertheless, pooling species that exhibited arty relationship) with human influence and comparing them with unrelated species indicated they were significantly smaller, nested closer to the ground, bad shorter incubation and fledging times, and tended to be altricial. Our results suport the ecosystent-stress hypothesis for the mejority of individual species and for overall species diversity when focusing on anthropogenic land cover. Nevertheless, the great variability in housing units across the land-cover gradient indicates that an intermediate-disturbance relationship is also supported. Our findings suggest preemptive conservation action should be taken, whereby areas with little anthropogenic land cover are given conservation priority. Nevertheless, conservation action should not be limited to pristine landscapes because our results showed that native avian richness and the relative abundance of many species peaked at intermediate housing densities and levels of anthropogenic land cover.},

Accurate estimates of abundance and distribution are needed for peripheral populations to inform management decisions. We show that ruffed grouse density at the southern periphery of their range is much lower than in areas farther north. We surveyed the abundance of drumming male grouse across northern Georgia during the springs of 2020–2021 by performing roadside point counts at 634 survey points. We used hierarchical distance sampling models to predict grouse abundance across north Georgia and model spatial variation in density. We estimated population size to be 2671 ruffed grouse in Georgia (95\% confidence interval 678–11 084). Mean grouse density was 0.003 drumming males/ha (SD = 0.006), with the highest density centered in the high-elevation mountains. Uncertainty around abundance estimates was high, in part due to low precision when estimating availability. Low detectability and precision are likely to be common issues when surveying low-abundance populations, as often occurs at range peripheries. We suggest that abundance estimation could be improved by integrating alternate methods, such as automated recording units, into existing monitoring protocols.},

Using point counts of bird abundance in 2007 and 2008, we show that changes in vegetation driven by elevation are strongly correlated with avian community structure in this treeline ecotone system. Overall, avian diversity was higher in the forest compared with other habitat classes (krummholz, deciduous shrub, and alpine). There were strong correlations between avian diversity and vegetation richness, as well as structure, among and within habitat class in 2008. Numerous habitat types (subset of habitat class) were correlated with avian composition, although some species were clearly habitat generalists. Contrary to expectation, avian species composition was associated with physiognomy (vegetation structure) in alpine and deciduous shrub, and with either physiognomy or floristics (vegetation species composition) in krummholz and forest. Given the strong impact of elevation on vegetation and the demonstrated influence on bird communities, we note that for bird species whose near-southernmost populations are found in the Mealy Mountains, climate change is likely to have a strong negative effect if alpine tundra habitat is lost. Furthermore, forest bird species are likely to benefit from the increased tree cover as treeline moves poleward and upward.},

To detect at which characteristic spatial scale different species and foraging guilds respond most strongly we analyzed the effect of plot-, patch- and landscape-level variables at different spatial extent (i.e., different kilometer radii) on species composition and foraging guilds. We used redundancy analysis to identify species-environment correlations, and to identify predictor variables that best explained the bird community structure, quantified the influence of plot-, patch- and landscape-level variables on the bird community composition. In addition, we used the 4th-corner method to detect significant relationships between the dietary guilds and plot-, patch- and landscape-level variables. We recorded 12,335 individuals of 181 bird species; 105 bird species were recorded foraging within the shaded coffee plantations. We found that plot- and landscape-level variables significantly explained the bird community composition best across all scales, and were significantly correlated with the abundance of the dietary guilds. In contrast, patch- level variables were less important. Habitat composition variables (i.e., coffee, forest and agricultural area) were among the most important predictors. Canopy structure was more important than other vegetation structure variables in explaining dietary guild structure. Hence, the maintenance of a heterogeneous landscape with a high-quality matrix within an agro-ecological region enhances bird conservation.},

However, there is a lack of pragmatic studies linking body size and interspecific competition to patterns in ecological communities. The objective of the present study was to determine the effect of body size (mass) on competitive interactions between bird pairs and to investigate the influence of food guilds. Point-counts were carried out in nine sites every month from November 2002 to November 2003 in the Cuetzalan Region, Mexico, and we used presence/absence and abundance data for the analyses. To calculate the strength of competition we used the Angle Frequency Method to extract form factors from 20 pairwise interactions. A prototype competition interaction and random pairs were also constructed. We used clustering techniques (PCA) to calculate the dissimilarity scores (distances, D) of each of the pairwise interactions to the prototype competition and random pairs and one-way ANOVA to test for differences between the means of the random and competitive pairs. The ratio in body mass (lnBM) for each of the interacting pairs was calculated, and the association between the lnBM ratio and the strength of competition (D) was tested using a Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient. To test for the influence of foraging guilds we used a univariate general linear model. Our results demonstrate a significant negative relationship between bird body mass ratio and competition strength - i.e. competition strength increased when the body masses of the birds became more similar. We did not find a significant influence of foraging guild on the relationship between body mass ratio and competition strength. On the basis of these results, we suggest that high variation in body sizes amongst sympatric species promotes coexistence in communities.},

Accipitriform species, such as Cooper's Hawk Accipiter cooperii, exhibit both delayed breeding and delayed plumage maturation. However, in certain circumstances, first-year females in non-definitive plumage do breed and apparently compete with older females for high-quality breeding territories. We predicted that these young females are at a competitive disadvantage compared with older females and that older females would have both higher reproductive success and be able to acquire higher quality nesting territories. We conducted brood counts and measured prey delivery rates by male Cooper's Hawks in an expanding urban population located in Albuquerque, New Mexico (USA), to assess our prediction. We found that older females had higher reproductive success, fledging 1.6 more offspring than younger females, and that they occupied territories where males provisioned at higher rates of 0.37 more prey items per 2-h period. Our results showed that older females fared better than first-year females but it is unclear if this is the result of passive or active competition. Older females initiated nesting 14.3days sooner than first-year females and thus may have filled vacant, high-quality territories before first-year females began seeking mates. Additionally, first-year females were never observed persistently to confront older females for breeding territories, but they did actively compete against each other. First-year females may defer to older females who, in a direct competitive interaction, would be most likely to prevail. Thus, delayed plumage maturation in Cooper's Hawks may serve to focus competition for nesting territories within age classes.},

  abstract = {Whether considering the cumulative impact of chronic, small-size oil discharges or accidents associated with marine traffic and offshore oil and gas development, seabirds face a variety of threats in the marine environment. Assessing the vulnerabilities of seabirds to maritime hazards requires an understanding of their species distribution, and a means for combining this information across groups. Using at-sea survey data gathered as part of a regional monitoring program, an efficient framework for integrating multi-species data was developed. Survey data was incorporated within a distance sampling framework to generate bias-corrected seabird densities for an area of over 730,000 km(2) size, which were used to construct multiple species distribution models (SDMs). The structural difficulties associated with sampling sparsely distributed individuals that also occur in large, localized concentrations led to the use of three modelling techniques potentially well suited for this type of data: negative binomial, ''hurdle'', and random forest methods. Predicted abundances were combined to produce an ensemble forecast, which met or exceeded the accuracy of predictions from the individual models. Multi-species potential sensitivity maps were developed to identify core areas, confirming the general importance of physiographic features such as the shelf break and bathymetry. Distribution was also seasonally influenced, with spring and winter standing out as periods of peak importance. When combined with an oil pollution layer derived from aerial surveillance, vulnerability was highest in the vicinity of major ports (e.g., Halifax and Sydney, Nova Scotia). However, the vulnerability map also indicated lower but widespread levels of oiling risk throughout the shelf, presumably associated with persistently high levels of shipping traffic and ongoing petroleum extraction and exploration.

  abstract = {Population monitoring traditionally relies on population counts, accounting or not for the issue of detectability. However, this approach does not permit to go into details on demographic processes. Therefore, Capture-Recapture (CR) surveys have become popular tools for scientists and practitioners willing to measure survival response to environmental change or conservation actions. However, CR surveys are expensive and their design is often driven by the available resources, without estimation about the level of precision they provide for detecting changes in survival, despite optimising resource allocation in wildlife monitoring is increasingly important. Investigating how CR surveys could be optimised by manipulating resource allocation among different design components is therefore critically needed. We have conducted a simulation experiment exploring the statistical power of a wide range of CR survey designs to detect changes in the survival rate of birds. CR surveys differ in terms of number of breeding pairs monitored, number of offspring and adults marked, resighting effort and survey duration. We compared open-nest (ON) and nest-box (NB) monitoring types, using medium- and long-lived model species. Increasing survey duration and number of pairs monitored increased statistical power. Long survey duration can provide accurate estimations for long-lived birds even for small population size (15 pairs). A cost-benefit analysis revealed that for long-lived ON species, ringing as many chicks as possible appears as the most effective survey component, unless a technique for capturing breeding birds at low cost is available to compensate for reduced local recruitment. For medium-lived NB species, focusing the NB rounds at a period that maximises the chance to capture breeding females inside nest-boxes is more rewarding than ringing all chicks. We show that integrating economic costs is crucial when designing CR surveys and discuss ways to improve efficiency by reducing duration to a time scale compatible with management and conservation issues.},

  abstract = {The taxonomic identification of micromammals might be complicated when the study material is fragmented, as it is the case with pellets and fossil material. On the other hand, tooth morphology generally provides accurate information for species identification. Teeth preserve notably well, retaining their original morphology, unlike skulls and mandibles, which can get crushed or have missing parts. Here, we explored a geometric morphometrics approach (GM) to identify fragmented specimens of two sympatric Calomys Waterhouse, 1837 species – Calomys tener (Winge, 1888) and Calomys expulsus (Lund, 1841) – using the morphology of intact molars as the basis for identification. Furthermore, we included some specimens of uncertain taxonomic identification to test their affinities and the utility of the shape of the molar to identify incomplete specimens. We evaluated the variations in the shape of the first upper molar (M1) among 46 owl pellets specimens of Calomys, including C. expulsus (n = 15), C. tener (n = 15), and unidentified specimens treated as Calomys sp. (n = 16) through GM analysis using 17 landmarks. The data was explored using PCA, PERMANOVA, and Discriminant analyses over the Procrustes residuals matrix were applied to evaluate inter- and intraspecific shape differences. Also, we evaluated whether allometric shape differences could impact the data, but found no evidence of a correlation between size and shape. Our results support that shape differences in the M1 are effective for discriminating between C. tener and C. expulsus. Moreover, the unidentified specimens do not represent a third shape but could be identified with confidence either as C. tener or C. expulsus. Our results show that even with fragmentary materials, GM is a feasible and useful tool for exploring inter-specific shape differences and assisting in taxonomic identification as a complement to traditional qualitative description of diagnostic features in poorly preserved specimens.},

We measured bird damage in Bluecrop' blueberry fields and Pinot noir vineyards in 2012-2014 in Michigan to investigate how year, grower, and forest cover influenced the proportions of bird damage. We tested whether inflatable tubemen (2013-2014) and a methyl anthranilate spray (2015) reduced bird damage in blueberries, and tested the deterrent effect of inflatable tubemen in grapes (2014). Years when crop yield was lower tended to have a higher damage percentage; for blueberries, bird damage was highest in 2012, and in grapes, damage was highest in 2012 and 2014. Neither blueberry fields nor vineyards with inflatable tubemen showed significantly reduced bird damage, although the blueberry fields showed a non-significant trend toward lower damage in the tubemen blocks. Blueberry field halves treated with the methyl anthranilate spray had equivalent bird damage to untreated halves. Our results correspond to previous work showing that percent bird damage varies by year, which was likely because bird consumption of fruit is relatively constant over time, while fruit yield varies. Fruit growers should expect a higher proportion of bird damage in low-fruit contexts, such as low-yield years, and prepare to invest more in bird management at those times. Investigating patterns of bird damage and testing deterrent strategies remain challenges. Bird activity is spatially and temporally variable, and birds' mobility necessitates tests at large scales.},

  abstract = {Nest box programs have often been established to conserve hollow-dependent fauna but their effectiveness is unknown in many jurisdictions. We examined nest box effectiveness in a 10-year experimental study in the Mountain Ash (Eucalyptus regnans) forests of Victoria (south-eastern Australia) where the paucity of hollow-bearing trees is a significant conservation issue. We quantified occupancy by arboreal marsupials, infestation by pest invertebrates, and nest box attrition. We found a large proportion of nest boxes (68.8\%) were never used, including by the endangered target species, Leadbeater’s Possum (Gymnobelideus leadbeateri). Nest boxes were more often occupied in younger forests (58.3\% cf 4.1\% for old forest) but these sites were also where infestations by the introduced European Honeybee (Apis mellifera) were greatest and where the probability of nest boxes collapsing was highest. Our data suggest that it is important to carefully target the locations where nest boxes should be established, but these same places are also those where most effort is required to maintain them, either by removing pest invertebrates and/or by re-attaching them to trees after they have fallen down. We recorded reasonable levels of occupancy by arboreal marsupials in young forest ∼2–3 years after box establishment, but then high levels of nest box attrition ({$>$}51\%) occurred after 8–10 years. This suggests an “effective occupancy time” for arboreal marsupials of only ∼5 years. A key consideration must be to weigh the ecological and economic effectiveness of nest boxes against other strategies such as implementing alternative silvicultural systems that result in the creation and retention of more hollow-bearing trees within logged areas.},

We addressed this question using a detailed case study encompassing a rare suite of inter-connected cross-sectional and longitudinal investigations that have spanned the past two decades and included work on: (1) the decay and collapse of large-cavity forest trees (termed "trees with hollows"), (2) populations of a suite of species of arboreal marsupials that are reliant on trees with hollows as nesting and denning sites, and (3) relationships between the abundance, type, and condition of trees with hollows and the presence, abundance, and species richness of these animals. Our case study was from the montane ash eucalypt forests of the Central Highlands of Victoria, southeastern Australia. Our longitudinal studies led to new insights that either would not have been possible from a cross-sectional study, or which were unexpected because they did not conform, or only partially conformed, to postulated responses made at the outset based on the results of earlier research. These new insights included: (1) a substantial slowing in rates of tree fall between 1997 and 2006, which were significantly lower than predicted from earlier data gathered between 1983 and 1993, (2) no evidence for a decline in populations of almost all species of arboreal marsupials between 1997 and 2007, despite the loss of nearly 14\% of the measured population of trees with hollows during that time, (3) changes in nest tree selection by some species of arboreal marsupials in response to these changes in hollow availability, (4) concentration effects, in which populations of animals used the declining tree hollow resource more intensively, and (5) evidence for significant rainfall effects on temporal changes in animal abundance. Our case study underscored the additional ecological insights that can be generated from longitudinal studies, including how relationships between biota and their habitat can change over time. Understanding these temporal changes is essential for informed forest management and biodiversity conservation, and points toward the need for greater use of longitudinal data sets in ecology. © 2011 by the Ecological Society of America.},

  abstract = {This paper reports the outcomes of a novel inter-twining of long-term monitoring data and population modelling to assess the accuracy of predictions of a Population Viability Analysis (PVA) model. In particular, the relative effectiveness of different management options for reserving areas from timber harvesting was assessed for two forest-dependent arboreal marsupials, the greater glider (Petauroides volans) and Leadbeater's Possum (Gymnobelideus leadbeateri). We used data from 7 years of monitoring conducted at 161 sites to assess and modify, where appropriate, previous population models of the two species of arboreal marsupials. The results indicated that the importance of food resources for both had been underestimated in past work. Despite this, the modified models that included increased importance of food availability did not change the predicted risks of decline substantially, particularly for Leadbeater's Possum. Importantly, past conclusions about the optimal sizes of patches to reserve within the forests used wood production were robust to changes in the model. This is a valuable finding because the work we report is one of the first to empirically test the robustness of the relative predictions of a PVA model. Nevertheless, the new insights we derived from this study have implications both for: (1) the implementation of our ongoing long-term monitoring study, in particular the value of what can be termed ȁ8adaptive monitoring', and, (2) the establishment of a new silvicultural experiment designed to better create habitat for arboreal marsupials within logged and regenerated sites.},

To address this knowledge gap, we quantified the response of Australian arboreal marsupials to: (1) the spatial effects of fire, (2) fire severity, and (3) fire impacts on the availability of critical nesting resources – hollow-bearing trees. We identified substantial differences among species in response to fire severity and landscape-scale fire. The Sugar Glider (Petaurus breviceps) and the endangered Leadbeater’s Possum (Gymnobelideus leadbeateri) were extremely rare on burned sites irrespective of fire severity. In addition, these two species declined with the amount of burned forest in the surrounding landscape even when their habitat remained unburnt. The Mountain Brushtail Possum (Trichosurus cunninghami) and the Greater Glider (Petauroides volans) both occurred on burned and unburned sites. The Greater Glider responded negatively to fire severity at the site level and also negatively to the amount of forest burned in the surrounding landscape. The abundance of the Mountain Brushtail Possum was lowest on sites subject to moderate severity fire. On unburned sites, the presence and abundance of virtually all species was characterised by a common positive response to the availability of nesting resources in hollow-bearing trees. Our findings underscore the importance of management practices to better protect species that decline after fire. These include conserving areas of unburned forest, particularly those with hollow-bearing trees which are critical nest sites for arboreal marsupials. These recommendations are currently the opposite of existing management practices.},

  abstract = {The validity and use of the indicator species concept, the design of logging impact studies, the need for long-term monitoring programs and how they might be designed, and, trade-offs between conservation strategies and economic costs are topics critical to the future direction of biological conservation in managed forests. The indicator species concept can make an important contribution to biodiversity conservation because of the impossibility of monitoring all taxa in species-rich forest environments. However, the concept has yet to be rigourously tested by validating relationships between an indicator species and entities for which it is hypothesized to be indicative. There can be serious negative consequences if the indicator species concept is incorrectly applied or inappropriate species are selected as indicators. Long-term monitoring will be critical for assessing not only the validity of concepts like indicator species, but also for appraising other rarely tested approaches to conservation in managed forests such as: (1) stand level management strategies to create and maintain key structural and floristic attributes that form critical habitat components for wildlife (e.g. large living and dead trees), (2) landscape level strategies to ensure the maintenance of landscape heterogeneity and connectivity, such as the establishment of networks of riparian protection zones and wildlife corridors, and, (3) landscape and regional level management involving the identification of reserves. While the importance of monitoring is often discussed, more programs are needed to gather the data needed to inform the development of ecologically sustainable forest management practices. Treating forestry activities as an experiment and overlaying well-designed monitoring pro,srams on such disturbance regimes is one useful way to accumulate key information on the effects of logging on biodiversity and how to mitigate such impacts. However, some major changes will be needed to instigate greater commitment to monitoring programs. These include: (1) identifying innovative ways to secure long-term funding that can be guaranteed beyond typical political and institutional timeframes, (2) education of funding bodies to ensure they recognise that useful results may take a prolonged period to obtain and that monitoring is not a second-rate science, (3) greater participation in the design and execution of monitoring programs by the scientific community, and, (4) stronger links among researchers and between researchers and managers to both improve the quality and validity of monitoring studies and to ensure that the results of such programs are incorporated into management practices.

  abstract = {A traditional focus in conservation biology has been on rare species as they are often those most at risk of decline or extinction. However, we argue in this paper that some kinds of currently common species also can be susceptible to decline. Those at particular risk are species that are specialized on widespread environmental conditions. Such specialization may make such species vulnerable to a range of drivers of environmental change, placing them at risk of significant decline or even local extinction. We illustrate this with a case study of the arboreal marsupial the Greater Glider (Petauroides volans) in south-eastern Australia. The Greater Glider was formerly common in two large-scale studies but in one it suffered rapid extinction (within a 3 year period) and in another it is declining at an annual rate of 8.8\%. We therefore argue for more research to better predict those kinds of currently common species which might be at risk of future rapid decline or extinction. In addition, we suggest there will often be a need to take pro-active conservation and management action to reduce the number of potential environmental stressors on populations of common species to ensure they do not become uncommon or rare. We also argue that conserving common species will ensure the retention of their key ecological and functional roles in ecosystems. Finally, we believe there is a need to develop better monitoring programs that can detect changes in the population trajectories of common species, help identify the reasons for temporal changes in such populations, and underpin timely management interventions. Despite these good intentions, we acknowledge that in one of our own long-term investigations we: (1) failed to anticipate the extremely rapid decline (and likely local extinction) of the Greater Glider, (2) were unable to diagnose the reason/s underpinning the population collapse, and (3) nor were we able to instigate a timely intervention program of management to prevent this from occurring. The key lesson from this sobering result is that common species can sometimes be at risk of rapid decline and it is wise to avoid complacency in conservation. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {We report on the design and implementation of ecological monitoring for an Australian biodiversity conservation incentive scheme - the Environmental Stewardship Program. The Program uses competitive auctions to contract individual land managers for up to 15 years to conserve matters of National Environmental Significance (with an initial priority on nationally threatened ecological communities). The ecological monitoring was explicitly aligned with the Program's policy objective and desired outcomes and was applied to the Program's initial Project which targeted the critically endangered White Box-Yellow Box-Blakely's Red Gum Grassy Woodland and Derived Native Grassland ecological community in south eastern Australia. These woodlands have been reduced to {$<$}3\% of their original extent and persist mostly as small remnants of variable condition on private farmland. We established monitoring sites on 153 farms located over 172,232 sq km. On each farm we established a monitoring site within the woodland patch funded for management and, wherever possible, a matched control site. The monitoring has entailed gathering data on vegetation condition, reptiles and birds. We also gathered data on the costs of experimental design, site establishment, field survey, and data analysis. The costs of monitoring are approximately 8.5\% of the Program's investment in the first four years and hence are in broad accord with the general rule of thumb that 5-10\% of a program's funding should be invested in monitoring. Once initial monitoring and site benchmarking are completed we propose to implement a novel rotating sampling approach that will maintain scientific integrity while achieving an annual cost-efficiency of up to 23\%. We discuss useful lessons relevant to other monitoring programs where there is a need to provide managers with reliable early evidence of program effectiveness and to demonstrate opportunities for cost-efficiencies. © 2012 Lindenmayer et al.},

  abstract = {Hollow-bearing trees are keystone structures in many ecosystems worldwide and they play critical habitat roles for a vast array of fauna through providing denning and/or nesting sites. We quantified empirical relationships between the diameter of hollow-bearing trees and probability of occupancy of these trees by cavity-dependent arboreal marsupials in the Mountain Ash (Eucalyptus regnans) forests of the Central Highlands of Victoria, south-eastern Australia. We also quantified the effects of other variables such as stand age and elevation on tree occupancy. Finally, we compared the diameter of occupied and unoccupied hollow-bearing trees with non-hollow-bearing trees in 77-year old forest that regenerated after fires in 1939 and which form the dominant age cohort of trees in our study region. Hollow-bearing trees occupied by arboreal marsupials had a larger diameter than unoccupied hollow-bearing trees. The mean diameter of both occupied and unoccupied hollow-bearing trees was almost three times that of 1939-aged trees that did not contain hollows. Our analyses contained evidence of inter-specific differences in the diameter of hollow-bearing trees occupied by different species of arboreal marsupials. Beyond the influence on occupancy of tree-level factors such as diameter, we also found that the probability of occupancy of a hollow-bearing tree was affected by the age of the surrounding forest and landscape attributes such as elevation. The probability of occupancy of an individual hollow-bearing tree was highest when that tree was located in regrowth forest, most likely because of the scarcity of these critical nesting and denning resources in such stands. Populations of large hollow-bearing trees, including those typically selected for occupancy by arboreal marsupials, are in rapid decline in Mountain Ash forests. This decline, coupled with the prolonged period until current cohorts of existing younger trees eventually reach an age (and therefore diameter) that are suitable for occupancy by arboreal marsupials, underscores the critical need to protect all existing hollow-bearing trees from practices that can otherwise destroy them, including industrial clearfelling operations. Better protection is important not only in the small remaining areas of old growth Mountain Ash forest but also in regrowth forest where such trees are scarce and have high marginal value as nesting sites, as reflected by high rates of per tree occupancy rates in stands of this age. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

Estimates of population sizes are obtained using a model-based statistical analysis. Results so far reveal considerable year-to-year variability in populations of Leadbeater's Possum (Gymnobelideus leadbeateri), the Mountain Brushtail Possum (Trichosurus cunninghamii), and the Greater Glider (Petauroides volans). There appears to be an initial decline in the numbers of Leadbeater's Possum, an increase in the Mountain Brushtail Possum and no change in the Greater Glider and the total number of arboreal marsupials. It will be possible report more substantive findings about long-term trends after several more years of the program. Relationships between current and past counts for Leadbeater's Possum and Mountain Brushtail Possum were very weak. This result appeared to be due to low levels of site fidelity for these two species.},

A total of 96 nest boxes was established using a rigorous experimental design – two regions (Powelltown and Toolangi State Forests), two forest age classes (20-year post-logging regrowth and 60-year fire- and salvage-logging regrowth), two nest-box designs (large boxes with large entrance holes and small boxes with small entrance holes), and two heights at which nest boxes were attached to trees (3 m and 8 m above the ground). The study entailed setting out four nest boxes at each of 24 sites to meet the design criteria. Evidence of occupancy by vertebrates was recorded in a total of 19 of 96 boxes on 11 of 24 sites site during regular inspections over more than three years. Thirteen boxes were used by Leadbeater's possum (Gymnobelideus leadbeateri), six by the mountain brushtail possum (Trichosurus cunninghami) and seven by the common ringtail possum (Pseudocheirus peregrinus). The common ringtail possum and mountain brushtail possum were seen only in high–large boxes but Leadbeater's possum used all but the low–large boxes. There was evidence of spatial dependence in usage patterns, with all four boxes at a given site showing signs of eventually being occupied. Only two nest boxes located in mountain ash forest regenerating after the 1939 wildfires were occupied. Relatively limited use of nest boxes supports concerns about the use of a nest box over large scales and long timeframes as an effective recovery tool for species threatened by the loss and subsequent shortage in the numbers of naturally occurring hollows.},

  abstract = {Many African protected areas (PAs) are not functioning effectively. We reviewed the performance of Zambia's PA network and provide insights into how their effectiveness might be improved. Zambia's PAs are under-performing in ecological, economic and social terms. Reasons include: a) rapidly expanding human populations, poverty and open-access systems in Game Management Areas (GMAs) resulting in widespread bushmeat poaching and habitat encroachment; b) underfunding of the Zambia Wildlife Authority (ZAWA) resulting in inadequate law enforcement; c) reliance of ZAWA on extracting revenues from GMAs to cover operational costs which has prevented proper devolution of user-rights over wildlife to communities; d) on-going marginalization of communities from legal benefits from wildlife; e) under-development of the photo-tourism industry with the effect that earnings are limited to a fraction of the PA network; f) unfavourable terms and corruption which discourage good practice and adequate investment by hunting operators in GMAs; g) blurred responsibilities regarding anti-poaching in GMAs resulting in under-investment by all stakeholders. The combined effect of these challenges has been a major reduction in wildlife densities in most PAs and the loss of habitat in GMAs. Wildlife fares better in areas with investment from the private and/or NGO sector and where human settlement is absent. There is a need for: elevated government funding for ZAWA; greater international donor investment in protected area management; a shift in the role of ZAWA such that they focus primarily on national parks while facilitating the development of wildlife-based land uses by other stakeholders elsewhere; and new models for the functioning of GMAs based on joint-ventures between communities and the private and/or NGO sector. Such joint-ventures should provide defined communities with ownership of land, user-rights over wildlife and aim to attract long-term private/donor investment. These recommendations are relevant for many of the under-funded PAs occurring in other African countries.}

The comparison is based on four factors: accuracy, model complexity, interpolation ability and error distribution. Two data sets, one simulated and one real world MODIS satellite image, were used to demonstrate the characteristics of each model. Experimental results show the superior performance of MLP with the simulated data set and better performance of ARTMMAP with the MODIS data set.},

  abstract = {The relative influence of habitat loss versus configuration on avian biodiversity is poorly understood. However, this knowledge is essential for developing effective land use strategies, especially for grassland songbirds, which have experienced widespread declines due to land use changes. Habitat configuration may be particularly important to grassland songbirds as configuration of habitat affects the extent of edge effects on the landscape, which strongly influences habitat use by grassland birds. We examined the relative influence of grassland amount and a measure of grassland configuration per se (Landscape Shape Index; LSI) on the relative abundance and richness of grassland songbirds. In 2013, 361 avian point counts were conducted across 47, 2.4 km radii landscapes in south-west Manitoba, Canada, selected to minimize the correlation between grassland amount and configuration. We used generalized linear mixed-effects models within a multi-model inference framework to determine the relative importance of grassland amount and configuration on songbird response variables. Effects of grassland amount and configuration were generally weak, but effects of configuration were greater than grassland amount for most species. Relative abundance and richness of obligate species, and Savannah sparrows, showed a strong negative response to LSI, while grasshopper sparrows responded positively to grassland amount. Our results suggest that habitat configuration must be considered when managing landscapes for conservation of grassland songbirds. Maintaining large, intact tracts of grasslands and limiting development of roads that bisect grassland parcels may be an effective means of maintaining grassland songbird diversity and abundance in northern mixed-grass prairies.},

  abstract = {Governing norms by which to steer traditional government functions are well established and understood; however, this is not the case for the new multi-level and collaborative approaches that characterize protected area governance. This is largely new territory that makes novel demands on governance institutions and policy. In this context, establishing and maintaining good governance across the diversity of ownership and responsibility arrangements is critical for the future effectiveness and acceptability of protected areas. Fulfilling the promise and avoiding the pitfalls inherent in contemporary protected area governance will require an understanding of what is meant by `good governance' and development of associated mechanisms to assess performance and provide a basis for improvement. This paper's contribution lies in the guidance it provides for the hitherto under-developed area of governance quality assessment. I first present a framework that positions governance quality in relation to governance and management effectiveness. I then characterize good protected area governance according to a set of seven principles - legitimacy, transparency, accountability, inclusiveness, fairness, connectivity and resilience. Together, the framework, governance principles and related performance outcomes provide a platform for assessment of governance quality for an individual terrestrial protected area, a network of several protected areas, or a national protected area system.

  abstract = {1. Control theory is a well-developed branch of mathematics and engineering that identifies optimal control policies for dynamic systems. While it should be useful for managing ecosystems, it is currently used only in certain fields of ecology and resource management, and only certain aspects of the theory are applied. Where optimal control policies have been determined, such as oceanic fisheries, the control policy often fails. 2. The goals of this study were to determine why control theory has not been used very much and why it fails, and also to improve its applicability to natural resource management. Control theory methods and assumptions were reviewed, and applications to agriculture, forestry and fisheries summarized. A comparison was made between control theory assumptions and the real ecological systems to which the method was applied. A fisheries example was developed to illustrate some improvements to the application of this technique. 3. It was shown that the paradoxical aspects of control theory in resource management result from the points of divergence of real systems from the assumptions of control theory. Because of non-linearities, noise, sampling difficulties, policy implementation error and other issues, ecosystems are neither readily observable nor easily controllable. This means that even theoretically correct control policies can lead to failure. 4. The fisheries example showed that measurement error and management lags can of themselves lead to the collapse of a fishery. It was shown that the costs of acquiring information and managing the system need to be incorporated explicitly into the control problem as decision variables. The solution to the fisheries control problem prevented extinction of the fishery by reducing sampling error and management lags to reasonable but non-zero levels. 5. Other suggestions are made for applying control theory with more success. By taking into account the deviations between the idealized control model and real systems, better resource management can be achieved. Control theory could also profitably be applied to the design of monitoring programmes, to model parameter estimation, and to other aspects of ecology and resource management where it is currently not being utilized. 6. Synthesis and applications. Control theory needs to be re-evaluated for its utility in natural resource management. It offers the potential for providing effective management policies. To achieve this potential, techniques borrowed from engineering must be expanded to incorporate the effects of state uncertainty (measurement error), environmental fluctuations (stochasticity), parameter uncertainty and policy implementation error.},

We compared two methods used to monitor numbers of chamois Rupicapra rupicapra and R. pyrenaica in two contrasting populations, and explored the relationship between the sampling effort and the repeatability of the results using resampling methods. One population in the Alps had been stable at a high density for several years, whereas the other population, located in the Pyrénées, was increasing exponentially, following a reintroduction. In both sites, a long-term monitoring programme based on individually marked chamois, allowed us to estimate population size using capture-mark-recapture methods (CMR). In addition, we calculated an index of population size as the mean number of animals observed on a foot transect surveyed repeatedly. We then compared whether trends estimated by each method were consistent. In the increasing population, both the index and the CMR estimates revealed an exponential increase in population size. In the stable population, neither the index nor the CMR estimate revealed any trend in size. Consistent results between the index and the CMR suggest that the index could be used to monitor trends in population size. Resampling techniques, however, pointed out that the index is only reliable when calculated over a sufficient number of surveys per year (10 in the Pyrenees, three in the Alps) and over a sufficient number of years of monitoring (about five years).},

Relatively high and unquantified error rates can negatively affect the ability of monitoring programs to accurately detect the population or abundance trends for which most were designed.},

In this set-up, an operator takes photos with a camera mounted on a 3-m pole at pre-determined sampling locations within habitat occupied by nesting penguins, and the actual boundaries of the plot in which penguin density is estimated are added post-survey. Density estimates are calculated by overlaying slope-speciWc templates delineating plot boundaries and distances of known dimensions onto the digital photos to allow a distance-sampling analysis to correct for any negative bias in counts arising from a proportion of penguins being obscured. Experimental assessment of biases in density estimates because of misclassiWcation error was {$<$}2\% when compared to true density, indicating that this survey method is eVective at accurately estimating penguin density and, therefore, abundance.},

  abstract = {Crown base height (CBH) is an essential tree biophysical parameter for many applications in forest management, forest fuel treatment, wildfire modeling, ecosystem modeling and global climate change studies. Accurate and automatic estimation of CBH for individual trees is still a challenging task. Airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) provides reliable and promising data for estimating CBH. Various methods have been developed to calculate CBH indirectly using regression-based means from airborne LiDAR data and field measurements. However, little attention has been paid to directly calculate CBH at the individual tree scale in mixed-species forests without field measurements. In this study, we propose a new method for directly estimating individual-tree CBH from airborne LiDAR data. Our method involves two main strategies: 1) removing noise and understory vegetation for each tree; and 2) estimating CBH by generating percentile ranking profile for each tree and using a spline curve to identify its inflection points. These two strategies lend our method the advantages of no requirement of field measurements and being efficient and effective in mixed-species forests. The proposed method was applied to a mixed conifer forest in the Sierra Nevada, California and was validated by field measurements. The results showed that our method can directly estimate CBH at individual tree level with a root-mean-squared error of 1.62 m, a coefficient of determination of 0.88 and a relative bias of 3.36\%. Furthermore, we systematically analyzed the accuracies among different height groups and tree species by comparing with field measurements. Our results implied that taller trees had relatively higher uncertainties than shorter trees. Our findings also show that the accuracy for CBH estimation was the highest for black oak trees, with an RMSE of 0.52 m. The conifer species results were also good with uniformly high R2 ranging from 0.82 to 0.93. In general, our method has demonstrated high accuracy for individual tree CBH estimation and strong potential for applications in mixed species over large areas.},

  abstract = {Distance sampling techniques were compared to point (variable plot) sampling and fixed-radius circular plot sampling for inventory of teak (Tectona grandis) plantations in Indonesia. n-tree distance sampling selects the n trees closest to a sample point located in the field. The distance to the nth closest tree is used as a plot radius. Two n-tree estimators were compared. Prodan (1968) described a technique for n=6, which counts the nth tree as 1/2 for tree counts and tree volume (or other tree attributes). Another approach, here called 'the (n-1)/n adjusted estimator', uses the bias correction factor (n-1)/n. Eberhardt (1967) demonstrated that the (n-1)/n adjusted estimator is unbiased for Poisson (random) and negative binomial (clumped) spatial distributions. No proof of unbiasedness is known for either method in uniform distributions which would be characteristic of plantations. n-tree sampling was performed in Indonesian teak plantations for values of n ranging from 3 to 10 for both methods. At the same locations, point (variable plot) samples with metric basal area factors 1 m(2) ha(-1) tree(-1) and 2 m(2) ha(-1) tree(-1) and fixed-radius circular plots 0.1 ha in size were installed for comparison with the n-tree distance methods. The time required for each sampling method was recorded at each field location. For each method, an efficiency ratio was calculated as (C-k(2) x Time(k))/(C-0.1ha(2) x Time(0.1ha)) where C-k is the coefficient of variation for method k, Time(k) is the average time required for method k, C-0.1 ha is the coefficient of variation for 0.1 ha plots and Time(0.1 ha) is the average time required for 0.1 ha plots. The more efficient methods have smaller efficiency ratios. According to this criterion, 5-tree distance sampling using Prodan's estimator was most efficient of the techniques compared that did not show bias for these data. The (n-1)/n adjusted estimator showed bias for these trials in teak plantations. This was probably due to the uniform spatial distribution characteristic of plantations. Point sampling with BAF=1 m(2) ha(-1) tree(-1) and BAF=2 m(2) ha(-1) tree(-1) and 0.1 ha plot sampling were not as efficient as n-tree sampling methods for these trials.

  abstract = {Large-scale monitoring of bird populations is often based on count data collected across spatial scales that may include multiple physiographic regions and habitat types. Monitoring at large spatial scales may require multiple survey platforms (e.g., from boats and land when monitoring coastal species) and multiple survey methods. It becomes especially important to explicitly account for detection probability when analyzing count data that have been collected using multiple survey platforms or methods. We evaluated a new analytical framework, N-mixture models, to estimate actual abundance while accounting for multiple detection biases. During May 2006, we made repeated counts of Black Oystercatchers (Haematopus bachmani) from boats in the Puget Sound area of Washington (n = 55 sites) and from land along the coast of Oregon (n = 56 sites). We used a Bayesian analysis of N-mixture models to (1) assess detection probability as a function of environmental and survey covariates and (2) estimate total Black Oystercatcher abundance during the breeding season in the two regions. Probability of detecting individuals during boat-based surveys was 0.75 (95\% credible interval: 0.42-0.91) and was not influenced by tidal stage. Detection probability from surveys conducted on foot was 0.68 (0.39-0.90); the latter was not influenced by fog, wind, or number of observers but was similar to 35\% lower during rain. The estimated population size was 321 birds (262-511) in Washington and 311 (276-382) in Oregon. N-mixture models provide a flexible framework for modeling count data and covariates in large-scale bird monitoring programs designed to understand population change.

Both direct and indirect methods can be used to survey mammals, but the latter are preferred due to the difficulty to come in sight of and/or to capture the individuals, besides being cheaper. We compared the performance of two methods to survey medium and large-sized mammal: track plot recording and camera trapping, and their costs were assessed. At Jatai Ecological Station (S21 degrees 31'15 ''- W47 degrees 34'42 ''-Brazil) we installed ten camera traps along a dirt road directly in front of ten track plots, and monitored them for 10 days. We cleaned the plots, adjusted the cameras, and noted down the recorded species daily. Records taken by both methods showed they sample the local richness in different ways (Wilcoxon, T=231; p;;0.01). The track plot method performed better on registering individuals whereas camera trapping provided records which permitted more accurate species identification. The type of infra-red sensor camera used showed a strong bias towards individual body mass (R-2=0.70; p=0.017), and the variable expenses of this method in a 10-day survey were estimated about 2.04 times higher compared to track plot method; however, in a long run camera trapping becomes cheaper than track plot recording. Concluding, track plot recording is good enough for quick surveys under a limited budget, and camera trapping is best for precise species identification and the investigation of species details, performing better for large animals. When used together, these methods can be complementary.},

Cozumel Island is not an exception, yet little published information exists on its bird diversity. In this study, we assessed the contribution of each major ecosystem of Cozumel Island (i.e., tropical forest, mangrove, palm thicket, and urban setting) to the island's avian diversity. Avian richness was highest in tropical forests, followed by mangroves, palm thickets, and urban setting. Bird densities were highest in urban settings, followed by tropical forests, mangroves, and palm thickets. Species composition similarity among ecosystems was low, with the most dissimilar ecosystem being the urban setting. Interestingly, we recorded the highest number of unique species in mangroves, followed by tropical forests, urban settings, and palm thickets. Tropical forests and mangroves of Cozumel Island are the main ecosystems harboring high avian diversity, with tropical forests housing high avian densities and endemics and mangroves including the most unique species. As expected, the contribution of urban settings to the avian diversity of Cozumel Island is limited and includes some highly abundant invasive species, of which the Eurasian Collared-Dove could represent a major ecological threat.},

  abstract = {Summary 1 The fraction of sampling units in a landscape where a target species is present (occupancy) is an extensively used concept in ecology. Yet in many applications the species will not always be detected in a sampling unit even when present, resulting in biased estimates of occupancy. Given that sampling units are surveyed repeatedly within a relatively short timeframe, a number of similar methods have now been developed to provide unbiased occupancy estimates. However, practical guidance on the efficient design of occupancy studies has been lacking. 2 In this paper we comment on a number of general issues related to designing occupancy studies, including the need for clear objectives that are explicitly linked to science or management, selection of sampling units, timing of repeat surveys and allocation of survey effort. Advice on the number of repeat surveys per sampling unit is considered in terms of the variance of the occupancy estimator, for three possible study designs. 3 We recommend that sampling units should be surveyed a minimum of three times when detection probability is high ({$>~$}0·5 survey?1), unless a removal design is used. 4 We found that an optimal removal design will generally be the most efficient, but we suggest it may be less robust to assumption violations than a standard design. 5 Our results suggest that for a rare species it is more efficient to survey more sampling units less intensively, while for a common species fewer sampling units should be surveyed more intensively. 6 Synthesis and applications. Reliable inferences can only result from quality data. To make the best use of logistical resources, study objectives must be clearly defined; sampling units must be selected, and repeated surveys timed appropriately; and a sufficient number of repeated surveys must be conducted. Failure to do so may compromise the integrity of the study. The guidance given here on study design issues is particularly applicable to studies of species occurrence and distribution, habitat selection and modelling, metapopulation studies and monitoring programmes.},

  abstract = {African forest elephants– taxonomically and functionally unique–are being poached at accelerating rates, but we lack range-wide information on the repercussions. Analysis of the largest survey dataset ever assembled for forest elephants (80 foot-surveys; covering 13,000 km; 91,600 person-days of fieldwork) revealed that population size declined by ca. 62\% between 2002–2011, and the taxon lost 30\% of its geographical range. The population is now less than 10\% of its potential size, occupying less than 25\% of its potential range. High human population density, hunting intensity, absence of law enforcement, poor governance, and proximity to expanding infrastructure are the strongest predictors of decline. To save the remaining African forest elephants, illegal poaching for ivory and encroachment into core elephant habitat must be stopped. In addition, the international demand for ivory, which fuels illegal trade, must be dramatically reduced.},

  abstract = {Estimating population abundance of marine turtles on their feeding grounds is needed to implement effective conservation strategies, but is logistically challenging. In-water monitoring surveys on feeding grounds are costly, time-consuming, stressful to the animals (when capture is required), and typically requires complex analytical skills. Here, we compare two sampling methods to estimate abundance of green turtles on one of their major feeding grounds in the Egyptian Red Sea: a) snorkelling strip transect counts, a rarely used method on marine turtles; and b) capture-mark-recapture (CMR) using photo-identification. The main goals of this research were to: 1) identify the most cost-effective method to estimate in-water marine turtle abundance; and 2) provide the first abundance estimates for green turtles on their feeding grounds in the Red Sea. Both methods produced an average monthly abundance of approximately 30 turtles, with no significant difference between the two methodologies. The strip-transect method presented major logistical advantages, including easy field implementation, simple equipment, and only basic analytical skills. Furthermore, this method provided density estimates that can be used as index for population trends. However, limitations of this method included intensive field effort and potentially altered turtle behaviour due to the presence of the observers. By contrast, photo-identification and CMR models provided valuable information of population demography but required advanced analytical skills, did not provide a measure of density, and could prove challenging in areas where turtles are not acclimated to human presence. Our results suggest that the ease data collection and associated analysis of the strip transect method should be considered when implementing a monitoring program of wildlife to be used for management and conservation purposes.

  abstract = {Estimating range-wide population trends of western burrowing owls (Athene cunicularia) requires standardized survey protocols that correct for detection bias in environments that support large owl populations. High concentrations of owls exist in irrigated agroecosystems within the southwest United States, yet little is known about the factors that affect detection bias during owl surveys in these systems. I used closed-population capture-recapture models to evaluate 4 factors that could affect the probability of a surveyor detecting an owl activity center (i.e., nest burrow) during visual surveys where owls are the focal object and analyzed the relationship (linear or curvilinear) between specific factors and detection probability. I recorded 1,199 detections of owls from 132 capture-recapture surveys within 12 sites of the Imperial Valley agroecosystem in California, USA between 16 April and 20 May 2006. I also conducted 96 time budget surveys throughout the day and used mixed linear models to evaluate the effect of each factor on probability of an owl activity center being available for detection (i.e., ¿= 1 owls above ground) during surveys. Model selection results indicated that detection probability was influenced by ambient air temperature interacting with wind speed. Detection probability followed a curvilinear relationship that resembled bell-shaped curve along a temperature gradient, with the maximum detection probability shifting as a function of wind speed. At low temperatures, detection probability declined with increased wind speed, but this relationship was reversed at high temperatures, producing a 3-dimensional pattern in detection probability characterized by a saddle-shaped hyperbolic paraboloid response surface. The probability of an activity center being available for detection declined curvilinearly with increased temperature and explained 51\% of the variation in detection probability. Given the broad range of detection probabilities, correcting visual survey counts for detection bias is necessary for comparing population estimates among regions and through time. Survey designs intended to estimate abundance of owls in southwest agroecosystems should incorporate methods to estimate and correct for variation in detection probability that include measurements of ambient temperature and wind speed for use as covariates.

  abstract = {Unbiased estimates of burrowing owl populations (Athene cunicularia) are essential to achieving diverse management and conservation objectives. We conducted visibility trials and developed logistic regression models to identify and correct for visibility bias associated with single, vehicle-based, visual survey occasions of breeding male owls during daylight hours in an agricultural landscape in California between 30 April and 2 May 2007. Visibility was predicted best by a second-degree polynomial function of time of day and 7 categorical perch types. Probability of being visible was highest in the afternoon, and individuals that flushed, flew, or perched on hay bales were highly visible (¿0.85). Visibility was lowest in agricultural fields (¡0.46) and nonagricultural vegetation (¡0.77). We used the results from this model to compute unbiased maximum likelihood estimates of visibility bias, and combined these with estimated probabilities of availability bias to validate our model by correcting for visibility and availability biases in 4 independent datasets collected during morning hours. Correcting for both biases produced reliable estimates of abundance in all 4 independent validation datasets. We recommend that estimates of burrowing owl abundance from surveys in the southwest United States correct for both visibility and availability biases. (C) 2011 The Wildlife Society.},

Information on the species has been based primarily on non-systematic surveys, and the corresponding status estimates are of unknown quality. We evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of two field methods for systematic surveys of populations of Cuvier's gazelle in arid environments: distance sampling (based on sightings) and sampling indirect sign (tracks and scats). The work was carried out in the north-western Sahara Desert, in Morocco, where what is possibly the largest population of Cuvier's gazelle persists. A logistically viable survey was conducted over a total area of c. 20.000 km(2) in 10 expeditions during 2011-2014. A total of 67 sites were surveyed, with 194 walking surveys (2,169 km in total). Gazelle signs were detected at 50 sites, and gazelles were sighted at 21 sites (61 individuals). We found a relationship between sightings and abundance indices based on indirect sign, which could be useful for population monitoring or ecological studies. Additionally, the data could be used in occupancy modelling. Density estimates based on distance sampling required considerable effort; however, it is possible to survey large areas during relatively short campaigns, and this proved to be the most useful approach to obtain data on the demographic structure of the population.},

  abstract = {Developing new cost-effective methods for monitoring the distribution and abundance of species is essential for conservation biology. Passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) has long been used in marine mammals and has recently been postulated to be a promising method to improve monitoring of terrestrial wildlife as well. Because Madagascar’s lemurs are among the globally most threatened taxa, this study was designed to assess the applicability of an affordable and open-source PAM device to estimate the density of pale fork-marked lemurs (Phaner pallescens). Using 12 playback experiments and one fixed transect of four automated acoustic recorders during one night of the dry season in Kirindy Forest, we experimentally estimated the detection space for Phaner and other lemur vocalizations. Furthermore, we manually annotated more than 10,000 vocalizations of Phaner from a single location and used bout rates from previous studies to estimate density within the detection space. To truncate detections beyond 150 m, we applied a sound pressure level (SPL) threshold filtering out vocalizations below SPL 50 (dB re 20 μPa). During the dry season, vocalizations of Phaner can be detected with confidence beyond 150 m by a human listener. Within our fixed truncated detection area corresponding to an area of 0.07 k­ m2 (detection radius of 150 m), we estimated 10.5 bouts per hour corresponding to a density of Phaner of 38.6 individuals/km2. Our density estimates are in line with previous estimates based on individually marked animals conducted in the same area. Our findings suggest that PAM also could be combined with distance sampling methods to estimate densities. We conclude that PAM is a promising method to improve the monitoring and conservation of Phaner and many other vocally active primates.},

The alternatives were evaluated based on how well they estimated the number of hardwoods and snags per hectare and their basal area per hectare using root mean square error and percent bias. In general, 3.6-m wide systematic strips oriented perpendicular to the stream outperformed the other alternatives. However, the variance of all six sampling alternatives was quite high and further research is needed to determine an optimal sampling method for quantifying hardwood and snag attributes in forests dominated by live conifers.

Some of these species produce readily identifiable sounds, providing an opportunity to use passive acoustic data to estimate animal density.

  abstract = {1 Accurate and precise estimates of abundance are required for the development of management regimes for deer populations. In woodland areas, indirect dung count methods, such as the clearance plot and standing crop methods, are currently the preferred procedures to estimate deer abundance. The use of line transect methodology is likely to provide a cost-effective alternative to these methods. 2 We outline a methodology based on line transect surveys of deer dung that can be used to obtain deer abundance estimates by geographical block and habitat type. Variance estimation procedures are also described. 3 As an example, we applied the method to estimate sika deer Cervus nippon abundance in south Scotland. Estimates of deer defecation and length of time to dung decay were used to convert pellet group density to deer density by geographical block and habitat type. The results obtained agreed with knowledge from cull and sightings data, and the precision of the estimates was generally high. 4 Relatively high sika deer densities observed in moorland areas up to 300 m from the forest edge indicated the need to encompass those areas in future surveys to avoid an underestimate of deer abundance in the region of interest. 5 It is unlikely that a single method for estimating deer abundance will prove to be better under all circumstances. Direct comparisons between methods are required to evaluate thoroughly the relative merits of each of them. 6 Line transect surveys of dung are becoming a widely used tool to aid management and conservation of a wide range of species. The survey methodology we outline is readily adaptable to other vertebrates that are amenable to dung survey methodology.},

An implicit assumption of standard line transect methodology is that detection probabilities depend solely on the perpendicular distance of detected objects to the transect line. Heterogeneity in detection probabilities is commonly minimized using stratification, but this may be precluded by small sample sizes. We develop a general methodology which allows the effects of multiple covariates to be directly incorporated into the estimation procedure using a conditional likelihood approach. Small sample size properties of estimators are examined via simulations. As an example the method is applied to eastern tropical Pacific dolphin sightings data.},

  abstract = {Line transect sampling is one of the most widely used methods for animal abundance assessment. Standard estimation methods assume certain detection on the transect, no animal movement, and no measurement errors. Failure of the assumptions can cause substantial bias. In this work, the effect of error measurement on line transect estimators is investigated. Based on considerations of the process generating the errors, a multiplicative error model is presented and a simple way of correcting estimates based on knowledge of the error distribution is proposed. Using beta models for the error distribution, the effect of errors and of the proposed correction is assessed by simulation. Adequate confidence intervals for the corrected estimates are obtained using a bootstrap variance estimate for the correction and the delta method. As noted by Chen (1998, Biometrics 54, 899-908), even unbiased estimators of the distances might lead to biased density estimators, depending on the actual error distribution. In contrast with the findings of Chen, who used an additive model, unbiased estimation of distances, given a multiplicative model, lead to overestimation of density. Some error distributions result in observed distance distributions that make efficient estimation impossible, by removing the shoulder present in the original detection function. This indicates the need to improve field methods to reduce measurement error. An application of the new methods to a real data set is presented.},

  abstract = {We review the four major contemporary methods for estimating density of group-living animals from line-transect sampling: perpendicular modelling of group centers, perpendicular modelling of center of measurable individuals, strip transects and animal–observer distance. The efficacy of each method is evaluated to produce a simple selection guide. We review the literature and use field data from the Udzungwa Mountains, Tanzania. The review is relevant to all group-living animals; however, examples are drawn from the primates. Perpendicular methods have better mathematical justification than non-perpendicular methods. For perpendicular methods using detection function models, it is preferable to measure group location using center of measurable individuals, as group centers are hard to estimate. The assumptions of detection function models are often broken in poor visibility habitats or with unhabituated animals. Alternatively strip transects may be used where there are reliable data on group spread and/or visibility. Strip transects are also the most practical, along with the animal–observer method; however, the latter lacks mathematical justification. We conclude that there are arguments for continued use of all four methods. In certain situations the use of raw encounter rates may also be considered. The appropriate method is determined by minimizing bias and considering time, resources and field conditions. Am. J. Primatol. 70:452–462, 2008. © 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

  abstract = {Ecosystem service assessments have increasingly been used to support environmental management policies, mainly based on biophysical and economic indicators. However, few studies have coped with the social-cultural dimension of ecosystem services, despite being considered a research priority. We examined how ecosystem service bundles and trade-offs emerge from diverging social preferences toward ecosystem services delivered by various types of ecosystems in Spain. We conducted 3,379 direct face-to-face questionnaires in eight different case study sites from 2007 to 2011. Overall, 90.5\% of the sampled population recognized the ecosystem's capacity to deliver services. Formal studies, environmental behavior, and gender variables influenced the probability of people recognizing the ecosystem's capacity to provide services. The ecosystem services most frequently perceived by people were regulating services; of those, air purification held the greatest importance. However, statistical analysis showed that socio-cultural factors and the conservation management strategy of ecosystems (i.e., National Park, Natural Park, or a non-protected area) have an effect on social preferences toward ecosystem services. Ecosystem service trade-offs and bundles were identified by analyzing social preferences through multivariate analysis (redundancy analysis and hierarchical cluster analysis). We found a clear trade-off among provisioning services (and recreational hunting) versus regulating services and almost all cultural services. We identified three ecosystem service bundles associated with the conservation management strategy and the rural-urban gradient. We conclude that socio-cultural preferences toward ecosystem services can serve as a tool to identify relevant services for people, the factors underlying these social preferences, and emerging ecosystem service bundles and trade-offs.}

  abstract = {Ghanaians have a long history in ivory, both for export and for carving. From the 1970s to the early 1990s, however, most of Ghana's elephant were killed either by local farmers in retribution for human-elephant conflict or by poachers for the ivory trade. Ghanaian ivory craftsmen used the tusks primarily to make jewellery and figurines over this time. These curios were mostly sold in Accra, the capital, but due to lack of market surveys, very little data are available. In July 2010 I surveyed the retail outlets selling ivory in Accra and counted only 10 items on display in an art gallery and 85 items brought to me in five of 186 souvenir shops and stalls I visited. The reason there were so few items was that the Ghana Police Service and Wildlife Division of the Forestry Commission had carried out a raid in November 2008 in the main curio market confiscating several hundred kilos of ivory items, fining and imprisoning the dealers. Since then the vendors in Accra have feared to sell ivory. Elephant poaching declined at the start of the 21st century thanks to improved law enforcement. In 2004 a new system was introduced that involves performance and adaptive management through the monitoring of patrol effort and observations by the field-staff in the Wildlife Division. The combined effect of performance and adaptive management was that the number of effective days spent in the field by an average Wildlife Guard doubled, which dramatically lowered the number of elephants killed illegally. In addition, governance improved, Ghanaians developed greater respect for the law and there was less corruption, which reduced elephant poaching and the sale of ivory objects. This paper concludes that Ghanaian examples of greater patrol staff performance through improved monitoring-and of successfully raiding outlets selling illegal ivory-are a sound approach to reducing elephant poaching. While improving anti-poaching exercises is more difficult in some African range States, the Ghanaian example of shop raids is easier to implement and has also worked in countries such as Cameroon and Ethiopia. Other countries in Africa, especially Cote d'Ivoire, Democratic Republic of Congo, Nigeria and Senegal, need to follow the example of Ghana in carrying out official raids on ivory in retail outlets.},

Specifically, we assessed how regional environmental conditions (i.e. sea surface temperature, chlorophyll a concentration, NAO index and fish catches), as proxies of climate change, prey availability and human-induced mortality factors, modulate the interannual variation in shearwater numbers. The change in the migratory population size of both shearwater species was estimated by fitting Generalized Additive Models (GAM) to the annual counts against the year of observation. Specifically, we modelled daily counts of migrant shearwaters during the post-breeding season. Contrary to current estimates at breeding colonies, coastal-land based counts of migrating birds provide evidence that Baleric and Scopoli's shearwaters have been recently increasing in the Mediterranean Sea. Our results highlight that demographic patterns in these species are complex and non-linear, suggesting that most of the increases have happened recently and intimately bounded to environmental factors, such as chlorophyll concentration and fisheries, that are closely related to human activities. Counts of migrating birds at strategic coastal points may provide useful estimates of the global population trend, as well as an efficient and rapid assessment of these and other seabird species in the Mediterranean.

This complexity has made the inferential and predictive processes challenging to perform. The Bayesian approach has become a good option to deal with these models due to the ease with which prior information can be incorporated along with the fact that it provides a more realistic and accurate estimation of uncertainty. In this paper, we first review the sources of information and different approaches (frequentist and Bayesian) to model the distribution of a species. We also discuss the Integrated Nested Laplace approximation as a tool with which to obtain marginal posterior distributions of the parameters involved in these models. We finally discuss some important statistical issues that arise when researchers use species data: the presence of a temporal effect (presenting different spatial and spatio-temporal structures), preferential sampling, spatial misalignment, non-stationarity, imperfect detection, and the excess of zeros.},

  abstract = {For ecosystem models to be applicable outside their context of development, temporal and spatial transferability must be demonstrated. This presents a challenge for modeling intertidal ecosystems where spatiotemporal variation arises at multiple scales. Models specializing in tidal dynamics are generally inhibited from having wider ecological applications by coarse spatiotemporal resolution or high user competency. The Tidal Inundation Model of Shallow-water Availability (TiMSA) uniquely simulates tides to empirically derive a time-integrated measure of availability for a shallow-water depth range defined by the user. To evaluate temporal and spatiotemporal transferability, we employed TiMSA at the development site in the Florida Keys and at novel subsites in the Florida Bay (application site) under a different time period (application period). We used foraging little blue herons (Egretta caerulea) as the ecological unit with which to constrain the model's “water depth window,” that is, range of water depths to estimate shallow-water availability. At the development site, temporally consistent water depth windows contrasted with interannual variation in shallow-water availability, which revealed short-term changes in Little Blue Heron foraging habitat. At the application site, water depth accuracy varied by subsite and was correlated with spatial error in bathymetric elevation. Although TiMSA parameters were sensitive to environmental temporal variation and uncertainty in spatial data, a spatially explicit water depth window generated reliable estimates of shallow-water conditions over space and time at the development and application sites. By exploring the contributing factors to model error, we provide solutions to reduce uncertainty of TiMSA parameters at potential application sites and recommendations for addressing bathymetric inaccuracy in digital elevation models. Accurately quantifying spatiotemporal changes of shallow water has implications for monitoring habitat conditions for tidally influenced species and projecting future changes to coastal ecosystems in response to anthropogenic stressors and natural disturbances such as sea level rise.},

To determine how to optimize nocturnal call-playback surveys of Yellow Rails, we evaluated the effects of survey methods (naive-estimated vs. detectability-adjusted estimated occupancy, observer, number of surveys, and the use of playbacks) and temporal and environmental conditions (e.g., time, date, temperature, moon phase, seasonality, and cloud cover) on detection probability. In 2010 and 2011, 334 call-broadcast night surveys for Yellow Rail were conducted at 167 survey points within 80 wetlands in south-central Manitoba, Canada. Yellow Rail detection probability was estimated at 0.63 in both years. In 2010, the detectability-adjusted wetland occupancy rate was estimated at 0.63, and in 2011 it was estimated at 0.36. Call-broadcast surveys contributed relatively little to improving Yellow Rail detectability, but repeat surveys at each site increased the number of individuals detected. Detection probability was not correlated with the temporal or environmental variables we studied, or by observer. Surveys where call-broadcasts are not feasible, such as volunteer surveys, are still likely to result in good estimates of Yellow Rail abundances, if surveys are repeated within breeding seasons.},

We estimated lowland and upland shorebird population sizes on 370,420 ha of military lands in interior Alaska boreal forest from May-July 2016 and 2017. We modified the Program for Regional and International Shorebird Monitoring (PRISM) protocol used elsewhere in Alaska and incorporated a probability-based sampling design and dependent double-observer methods. We pooled all lowland shorebird and all upland shorebird observations and estimated abundance using Huggins closed captures models in Program MARK. Estimated abundances of all lowland and upland shorebirds were 42,239 +/- 13,431 (SE) and 3,523 +/- 494, respectively. The survey area is important for shorebirds in Alaska. We estimate that military lands in interior Alaska support 45,762 +/- 13,925 shorebirds, including 7 species of conservation concern. Higher abundance of lowland shorebirds was best explained by lower elevation, lower percent scrub canopy, and higher percent water on plots. Higher abundance of upland shorebirds was best explained by higher elevation and increased distance to wetland. Our modified Arctic PRISM protocol was effective for surveys in the boreal forest and we recommend continued use of method modifications for future shorebird surveys in boreal forests. Identifying baseline abundances of shorebirds using interior Alaska is an important step in monitoring distributional shifts and potential future population declines. (c) 2020 The Authors.

We examine the relationships among five approaches to conservation M\&E, characterizing each approach in eight domains: the focal question driving each approach, when in the project cycle each approach is employed, scale of data collection, the methods of data collection and analysis, the implementers of data collection and analysis, the users of M\&E outputs, and the decisions informed by these outputs. Ambient monitoring measures status and change in ambient social and ecological conditions, independent of any conservation intervention. Management assessment measures management inputs, activities, and outputs, as the basis for investments to build management capacity for conservation projects. Performance measurement assesses project or program progress toward desired levels of specific activities, outputs, and outcomes. Impact evaluation is the systematic process of measuring the intended and unintended causal effects of conservation interventions, with emphasis upon long-term impacts on ecological and social conditions. Systematic review examines existing research findings to assess the state of the evidence regarding the impacts of conservation interventions, and to synthesize the insights emerging from this evidence base. Though these five approaches have some commonalities, they complement each other to provide unique insights for conservation planning, capacity-building, adaptive management, learning, and accountability. Ambient monitoring, management assessment, and performance measurement are now commonplace in conservation, but opportunities remain to inform conservation policy and practice more fully through catalytic investments in impact evaluations and systematic reviews.

  abstract = {Accurate and precise density estimates are crucial for effective species management and conservation. However, efficient monitoring of mammal densities over large spatial and temporal scales is challenging. In the United Kingdom, published density estimates for many mammals, including species considered to be common, are imprecise. Camera trap distance sampling (CTDS) can estimate densities of multiple species at a time and has been used successfully in a small number of studies. However, CTDS has typically been used over relatively homogeneous landscapes, often over large time scales, making monitoring changes (by repeating surveys) difficult. In this study, we deployed camera traps at 109 sites across an area of 2725 km2 of varied habitat in North-East England, United Kingdom. The 4-month survey generated 51 447 photos of wild mammal species. Data were sufficient for us to use CTDS to estimate the densities of eight mammal species across the whole-survey area and within four specific habitats. Both survey-wide and habitat-specific density estimates largely fell within previously published density ranges and our estimates were amongst the most precise produced for these species to date. Lower precision for some species was typically due to animals being missed by the camera at certain distances, highlighting the need for careful consideration of practical and methodological decisions, such as how high to set cameras and where to left-truncate data. Although CTDS is a promising methodology for determining densities of multiple species from one survey, species-specific decisions are still required and these cannot always be generalized across species types and locations. Taking the United Kingdom as a case study, our study highlights the potential for CTDS to be used on a national scale, although the scale of the task suggests that it would need to be integrated with a citizen science approach.},

  abstract = {Population abundance estimates using predictive models are important for describing habitat use and responses to population-level impacts, evaluating conservation status of a species, and for establishing monitoring programs. The golden-cheeked warbler (Setophaga chrysoparia) is a neotropical migratory bird that was listed as federally endangered in 1990 because of threats related to loss and fragmentation of its woodland habitat. Since listing, abundance estimates for the species have mainly relied on localized population studies on public lands and qualitative-based methods. Our goal was to estimate breeding population size of male warblers using a predictive model based on metrics for patches of woodland habitat throughout the species' breeding range. We first conducted occupancy surveys to determine range-wide distribution. We then conducted standard point-count surveys on a subset of the initial sampling locations to estimate density of males. Mean observed patch-specific density was 0.23?males/ha (95\% CI?=?0.1970.252, n?=?301). We modeled the relationship between patch-specific density of males and woodland patch characteristics (size and landscape composition) and predicted patch occupancy. The probability of patch occupancy, derived from a model that used patch size and landscape composition as predictor variables while addressing effects of spatial relatedness, best predicted patch-specific density. We predicted patch-specific densities as a function of occupancy probability and estimated abundance of male warblers across 63,616 woodland patches accounting for 1.678 million ha of potential warbler habitat. Using a Monte Carlo simulation, our approach yielded a range-wide male warbler population estimate of 263,339 (95\% CI: 223,927302,620). Our results provide the first abundance estimate using habitat and count data from a sampling design focused on range-wide inference. Managers can use the resulting model as a tool to support conservation planning and guide recovery efforts. (c) 2012 The Wildlife Society.},

  abstract = {We revisit the common standards recommended by Ralph et al. (1993, 1995a) for conducting point-count surveys to assess the relative abundance of landbirds breeding in North America. The standards originated from discussions among ornithologists in 1991 and were developed so that point-count survey data could be broadly compared and jointly analyzed by national data centers with the goals of monitoring populations and managing habitat. Twenty years later, we revisit these standards because (1) they have not been universally followed and (2) new methods allow estimation of absolute abundance from point counts, but these methods generally require data beyond the original standards to account for imperfect detection. Lack of standardization and the complications it introduces for analysis become apparent from aggregated data. For example, only 3\% of 196,000 point counts conducted during the period 1992-2011 across Alaska and Canada followed the standards recommended for the count period and count radius. Ten-minute, unlimited-count-radius surveys increased the number of birds detected by ¿300\% over 3-minute, 50-m-radius surveys. This effect size, which could be eliminated by standardized sampling, was ¿= 10 times the published effect sizes of observers, time of day, and date of the surveys. We suggest that the recommendations by Ralph et al. (1995a) continue to form the common standards when conducting point counts. This protocol is inexpensive and easy to follow but still allows the surveys to be adjusted for detection probabilities. Investigators might optionally collect additional information so that they can analyze their data with more flexible forms of removal and time-of-detection models, distance sampling, multiple-observer methods, repeated counts, or combinations of these methods.

  abstract = {Monitoring programs have the potential to identify population declines and differentiate among the possible cause(s) of these declines. Recent criticisms regarding the design of monitoring programs have highlighted a failure to clearly state objectives and to address detectability and spatial sampling issues. Here, we incorporate these criticisms to design an efficient monitoring program whose goals are to determine environmental factors which influence the current distribution and measure change in distributions over time for a suite of amphibians. In designing the study we (1) specified a priori factors that may relate to occupancy, extinction, and colonization probabilities and (2) used the data collected (incorporating detectability) to address our scientific questions and adjust our sampling protocols. Our results highlight the role of wetland hydroperiod and other local covariates in the probability of amphibian occupancy. There was a change in overall occupancy probabilities for most species over the first three years of monitoring. Most colonization and extinction estimates were constant over time (years) and space (among wetlands), with one notable exception: local extinction probabilities for Rana clamitans were lower for wetlands with longer hydroperiods. We used information from the target system to generate scenarios of population change and gauge the ability of the current sampling to meet monitoring goals. our results highlight the limitations of the current sampling design, emphasizing the need for long-term efforts, with periodic re-evaluation of the program in a framework that can inform management decisions.

  abstract = {Context. Fire severity and frequency is predicted to increase over the remainder of the 21st century in Australia’s temperate forests; therefore, the effects of fire severity on forestdependant species is of major conservation concern. Aims. Determining the short-term ({$<$}1 year) effect of fire severity on a forest-dependant species, the greater glider, Petauroides volans, in Monga National Park, south-eastern New South Wales. Methods. Three fire-severity classes were investigated, namely, low (canopy unburnt), moderate (partial canopy burn) and high (complete canopy consumption). Fifteen randomly allocated sites were visited in total, with five sites in each fire-severity class being visited on three separate occasions. Spotlighting of two offtrack transects per site was completed over a 4-week period by using multi-covariate distance sampling (MCDS) to estimate greater glider densities at each fire-severity class. Key results. An overall mean greater glider density estimate of 0.456 ha−1 (95\% confidence interval (CI) 0.256–0.654 ha−1) was calculated across all sites in Monga National Park. Density estimates varied among fire-severity classes; low 0.779 ha−1 (95\% CI 0.358–1.692 ha−1), moderate 0.472 ha−1 (95\% CI 0.262–0.848 ha−1), and high 0.077 ha−1 (95\% CI 0.0142–0.414 ha−1). Conclusions. Distance sampling estimates suggested that areas affected by high-severity fire have lower densities of greater gliders. Implications. The importance of areas experiencing low fire severity as a source of greater glider refugia during wildfire events is evident. Under a changing climate, frequent major wildfire events may significantly affect population viability of greater gliders if insufficient time between fires allow for population recovery.},

In 1999-2000, we surveyed 196 stock ponds within grassland (¿95\% grass) and cropland (¿75\% tillage) landscapes to evaluate effects of land use on nongame wetland bird densities in western South Dakota. Land use and wetlands were delineated from Landsat TM imagery and National Wetlands Inventory maps. Sixteen nongame wetland bird species used stock ponds in western South Dakota. of which nine species were obligate wetland-nesting species. Although densities of seven nongame obligate wetland bird species were similar between landscape types, abundance of Wilson's Phalarope (Phalaropus tricolor) was greater in grassland study areas where cattle grazing limited growth of thick-stemmed emergent vegetation and reduced overall vegetative cover in stock ponds. In contrast, the Red-winged Blackbird (Agelaius phoeniceus) and Yellow-headed Blackbird (Xanthocephalus xanthocephalus) were more abundant in cropland landscapes where stock ponds provide abundant over-water nesting habitat (e.g., cattail). If grasslands continue to be converted to cropland, Wilson's Phalarope numbers will likely decrease as blackbird densities increase in stock ponds dominated by monotypic stands of cattail. To circumvent such changes, we recommend that resource managers conserve large tracts of grassland through aggressive easement programs in landscapes at highest risk of agricultural tillage.},

  abstract = {Detecting individuals of amphibian and reptile species can be a daunting task. Detection can be hindered by various factors such as cryptic behavior, color patterns, or observer experience. These factors complicate the estimation of state variables of interest (e.g., abundance, occupancy, species richness) as well as the vital rates that induce changes in these state variables (e.g., survival probabilities for abundance; extinction probabilities for occupancy). Although ad hoc methods (e.g., counts uncorrected for detection, return rates) typically perform poorly in the face of no detection, they continue to be used extensively in various fields, including herpetology. However, formal approaches that estimate and account for the probability of detection, such as capture-mark-recapture (CMR) methods and distance sampling, are available. In this paper, we present classical approaches and recent advances in methods accounting for detectability that are particularly pertinent for herpetological data sets. Through examples, we illustrate the use of several methods, discuss their performance compared to that of ad hoc methods, and we suggest available software to perform these analyses. The methods we discuss control for imperfect detection and reduce bias in estimates of demographic parameters such as population size, survival, or, at other levels of biological organization, species occurrence. Among these methods, recently developed approaches that no longer require marked or resighted individuals should be particularly of interest to field herpetologists. We hope that our effort will encourage practitioners to implement some of the estimation methods presented herein instead of relying on ad hoc methods that make more limiting assumptions.},

It is difficult to judge the benefit of management actions that accelerate information gain, relative to the benefit of making the best management decision given what is known at the time. We present a first step in developing methods to optimize management decisions that incorporate both uncertainty and learning via adaptive management We assumed a manager can allocate effort to discrete units (e.g., areas for revegetation or animals for reintroduction), the outcome can be measured as success or failure (e.g., the revegetation in an area is successful or the animal survives and breeds), and the manager has two possible management options from which to choose. We further assumed that there is an annual budget that may be allocated to one or both of the two options and that the manager must decide on the allocation. We used Bayesian updating of the probability of success of the two options and stochastic dynamic programming to determine the optimal strategy over a specified number of years, The costs, level of certainty about the success of the two options, and the timeframe of management all influenced the optimal allocation of the annual budget. In addition, the choice of management objective had a large influence on the optimal decision. In a case study of Merri Creek, Melbourne, Australia, we applied the approach to determining revegetation strategies. Our approach can be used to determine how best to manage ecological systems in the face of uncertainty.},

Species can be difficult to detect when rare but, in general, how detection probabilities vary with abundance is unknown. We developed a new detectability model based on the time to detection of the first individual of a species. Based on this model, the predicted detection rate is proportional to a power function of abundance with a scaling exponent between zero and one that depends on clustering of individuals. We estimated the model parameters with data from three independent datasets: searches for chenopod shrub species and coins, experimental searches for planted seedlings, and frog surveys at multiple sites in sub-tropical forests of eastern Australia. Analyses based on the detection time and detection probability suggest that detection rate increases with abundance as predicted. The model provides a way to scale detection rates to cases of low abundance when direct estimation of detection rates is often impractical.},

Heuristic properties can suggest preferred indices, but we lack objective ways to discriminate between indices with similar heuristics. Biodiversity indices can be evaluated by determining how well they reflect management objectives that a monitoring program aims to support. For example, the Convention on Biological Diversity requires reporting about extinction rates, so simple indices that reflect extinction risk would be valuable. We developed 3 biodiversity indices that are based on simple models of population viability that relate extinction risk to abundance. We based the first index on the geometric mean abundance of species and the second on a more general power mean. In a third index, we integrated the geometric mean abundance and trend. These indices require the same data as previous indices, but they also relate directly to extinction risk. Field data for butterflies and woodland plants and experimental studies of protozoan communities show that the indices correlate with local extinction rates. Applying the index based on the geometric mean to global data on changes in avian abundance suggested that the average extinction probability of birds has increased approximately 1\% from 1970 to 2009., Conectando Índices para el Monitoreo de la Biodiversidad con la Teoría de Riesgo de Extinción},

We compared the male food-delivery call to standard vocalizations used to locate Northern Goshawk nests during each breeding phase. An adult alarm and male food-delivery call were broadcast during the courtship (1999 only), nestling, and fledgling-dependency breeding phases, whereas a juvenile-begging call was broadcast only during the latter phase, when young were sufficiently developed to respond to calls. Northern Goshawks were detected at 52\% (N = 88) of all broadcast trials. The male food-delivery call did not improve detection rates throughout the breeding season. Detection rates were lowest (40\%) during courtship and highest (75\%) during the fledgling-dependency phase. The distance we detected Northern Goshawks from nests with male food-delivery and alarm calls increased between courtship and nestling phases to the fledgling-dependency phase when the majority of detections shifted from adults to fledglings. Breeding phase did not influence the probability of detecting goshawks with male food-delivery and alarm calls. Broadcasting the juvenile-begging call within the fledgling-dependency phase increased the probability of detecting Northern Goshawks relative to the other two call types. The alarm and juvenile-begging calls remain the most effective for detecting Northern Goshawks on Vancouver Island during the nestling and fledgling-dependency periods, respectively. Dense coastal vegetation and rugged terrain may have interfered with our ability to project broadcast calls and to detect Northern Goshawks. The efficacy of broadcast surveys in Pacific Northwest forests during the nestling phase may be improved by spacing broadcast stations and transects at 200-m intervals, rather than the current standard of 300-m intervals, when detections occur close to nests. Broadcast stations and transects could be spaced 400-m apart during the fledgling-dependency phase when fledglings arc detected farther from nest sites.},

Therefore, we developed habitat use models to quantify habitat relationships for breeding birds within a mostly forested landscape centered on Tuskegee National Forest, Alabama. We conducted bird counts at 338 points and derived habitat characteristics within 100 m of each point using the Alabama Gap Analysis Program land cover map and the National Land Cover Database Tree Canopy Cover map. We modeled avian abundances and habitat associations based on cover type and canopy cover using N-mixture models. We detected more than 16,000 individuals of 85 species, and we present models of abundances for 42 species. Canopy cover was the most influential habitat characteristic, although many species abundances were influenced by cover type. For most species, detection was influenced by observer; date, time, and weather variables were less important in determining detectability. We demonstrate how bird habitat associations can be modeled at a coarse spatial scale using publicly available land cover maps. Our observations regarding the habitat associations of birds in Tuskegee National Forest may be applicable elsewhere within the East Gulf Coastal Plain, but the regional specificity of habitat use should be tested before such extrapolations are justified.},

Stand structure is defined in terms of structural attributes and stand structural complexity. Stand structural complexity is considered to be a measure of the number of different attributes present and the relative abundance of each of these attributes. The review indicates there is no definitive suite of structural attributes; different authors emphasise subsets of different attributes, and relatively few studies provide quantitative evidence linking attributes to the provision of faunal habitat or other measures of biodiversity, although a number of studies identify attributes that distinguish between successional stages. A summary of key structural attributes identified in the literature is presented under the following stand elements: foliage arrangement, canopy cover, tree diameter, tree height, tree spacing, tree species, stand biomass, understorey vegetation, and deadwood. Indices of structural complexity are also reviewed. Three types of index framework are identified: indices based on the cumulative score of attributes; indices based on the average score of groups of attributes; and indices based on the interaction of attributes. The review identifies a variety of different indices under each of these frameworks with no single index preferred over the others. The most prominent of these indices are discussed in detail and the following guidelines suggested for the development of an index of structural complexity: (1) Start with a comprehensive set of structural attributes, in which there is a demonstrated association between attributes and the elements of biodiversity that are of interest. (2) Use a simple mathematical system to construct the index; this facilitates the use of multiple attributes and interpretation of the index in terms of real stand conditions. (3) Score attributes relative to the range of values occurring in stands of a comparable vegetation community. (4) Try different weightings of attributes in the index, adopting those weightings which most clearly distinguish between stands.},

We examined avian community composition at seasonal pools in Rhode Island to test the hypothesis that seasonal pools would support a greater abundance and diversity of birds than nearby upland sites. From mid-May to June 2008, we conducted point counts at 33 paired sets of seasonal pools and upland sites that were 150 m apart. Bird abundance and diversity was significantly higher at seasonal pools than upland sites, whereas community composition as measured by evenness was similar. We also found that the mean abundance of birds was significantly greater at urban pools than rural pools. Our results suggest that birds preferentially use seasonal pools, particularly in more urban settings, adding to the body of evidence that supports the protection and restoration of small isolated wetlands in urban landscapes.},

We investigated the degree to which birds utilize urban wetlands by examining breeding bird communities in urban and rural wetlands and nearby uplands in the northeast US. From mid-May through June in 2008, we conducted 10-min, 50m radius point counts at 99 randomly chosen sites along a gradient of watershed urbanization. Bird abundance and species richness was significantly higher in wetlands versus uplands, and at urban wetlands versus urban uplands, but not at rural wetlands versus rural uplands. Overall, more species were present at wetland versus upland sites, but the difference between wetland and upland was less for human-tolerant species. While the amount of natural vegetation within a 50 m buffer of a site was significantly negatively correlated with the amount of urban land within 1 km, bird abundance and species richness increased. Species-specific habitat models using general vegetation classes showed differences in bird habitat associations as watersheds became more urbanized. Our findings demonstrate the importance of wetland habitats for birds, and add to the body of evidence that supports the protection and restoration of wetlands as a means towards maintaining or enhancing habitat heterogeneity and biodiversity in urban landscapes.

  abstract = {Context Monitoring is a key component in managing wildlife populations and is critical for revealing long-term population trends of endangered species. Cryptic or highly mobile species that occur in low densities and in remote terrain require the development of specific monitoring methods. The southern cassowary is an Australian endangered species that poses many challenges for conducting population surveys. Aims The aims of the present study were to determine the effectiveness of camera traps in detecting cassowaries at a site, to determine whether visual lures increased detection rates, and to explore the potential of camera traps in population surveys. Methods Coloured lures (mimicking large blue and red fruit) were placed in front of a set of camera traps and compared with controls (no lures) at 29 survey sites on the Daintree coast, northern Queensland, Australia. Key results Camera traps with lures (1) detected more birds, (2) had a shorter detection latency, (3) had a marginally greater number of captures, (4) experienced a longer capture duration, (5) were more likely to have the cassowary stop in front of the camera, and (6) achieved a 95\% probability of detecting cassowaries in 12 trap days, compared with 28 trap days without lures. Conclusions An increase in the number of cassowaries detected, the reduction in camera latency times and the ability to identify the birds enables a more efficient approach to estimating population sizes over existing methods. This is the first published study to use visual lures to conduct camera trapping of birds. Implications The use of camera traps with lures is a practical and cost-efficient technique for the rapid detection of cassowaries at a site and lends itself to studies of population structure, size and trends.},

  abstract = {The trade in wildlife products can represent an important source of income for poor people, but also threaten wildlife locally, regionally and internationally. Bushmeat provides livelihoods for hunters, traders and sellers, protein to rural and urban consumers, and has depleted the populations of many tropical forest species. Management interventions can be targeted towards the consumers or suppliers of wildlife products. There has been a general assumption in the bushmeat literature that the urban trade is driven by consumer demand with hunters simply fulfilling this demand. Using the urban bushmeat trade in the city of Kumasi, Ghana, as a case study, we use a range of datasets to explore the processes driving the urban bushmeat trade. We characterise the nature of supply and demand by explicitly considering three market attributes: resource condition, hunter behaviour, and consumer behaviour. Our results suggest that bushmeat resources around Kumasi are becoming increasingly depleted and are unable to meet demand, that hunters move in and out of the trade independently of price signals generated by the market, and that, for the Kumasi bushmeat system, consumption levels are driven not by consumer choice but by shortfalls in supply and consequent price responses. Together, these results indicate that supply-side processes dominate the urban bushmeat trade in Kumasi. This suggests that future management interventions should focus on changing hunter behaviour, although complementary interventions targeting consumer demand are also likely to be necessary in the long term. Our approach represents a structured and repeatable method to assessing market dynamics in information-poor systems. The findings serve as a caution against assuming that wildlife markets are demand driven, and highlight the value of characterising market dynamics to informappropriate management.},

  abstract = {Landscapes in many developing countries consist of a heterogeneous matrix of mixed agriculture and forest. Many of the generalist species in this matrix are increasingly traded in the bushmeat markets of West and Central Africa. However, to date there has been little quantification of how the spatial configuration of the landscape influences the urban bushmeat trade over time. As anthropogenic landscapes become the face of rural West Africa, understanding the dynamics of these systems has important implications for conservation and landscape management. The bushmeat production of an area is likely to be defined by landscape characteristics such as habitat disturbance, hunting pressure, level of protection, and distance to market. We explored (SSG, tense) the role of these four characteristics in the spatio-temporal dynamics of the commercial bushmeat trade around the city of Kumasi, Ghana, over 27 years (1978 to 2004). We used geographic information system methods to generate maps delineating the spatial characteristics of the landscapes. These data were combined with spatially explicit market data collected in the main fresh bushmeat market in Kumasi to explore the relationship between trade volume (measured in terms of number of carcasses) and landscape characteristics. Over time, rodents, specifically cane rats (Thryonomys swinderianus), became more abundant in the trade relative to ungulates and the catchment area of the bushmeat market expanded. Areas of intermediate disturbance supplied more bushmeat, but protected areas had no effect. Heavily hunted areas showed significant declines in bushmeat supply over time. Our results highlight the role that low intensity, heterogeneous agricultural landscapes can play in providing ecosystem services, such as bushmeat, and therefore the importance of incorporating bushmeat into ecosystem service mapping exercises. Our results also indicate that even where high bushmeat production is possible, current harvest levels may cause wildlife depletion.},

  abstract = {The increasing economic and environmental losses caused by non-native invasive species amplify the value of identifying and implementing optimal management options to prevent, detect, and control invasive species. Previous literature has focused largely on preventing introductions of invasive species and post-detection control activities; few have addressed the role of detection. By increasing resources to detect invasive species, managers may increase their chances of finding a species at a smaller population level, lessening the extent of damages and making subsequent control potentially less expensive and more effective. However, detecting new invasive species is difficult and uncertain; many factors reduce the likelihood of successful detection, such as low population densities which are prevalent in invasive species management. This paper presents a model that captures the stochastic and dynamic aspects of this trade-off by incorporating a detection stage in which the agency managers choose search effort prior to the post-detection control stage. The analysis of the model illustrates that the optimal detection strategy depends primarily on the ‘detectability’, or ease of detection, and the biological relationships of each distinct species.

  abstract = {Aim: To analyse the conservation status of tropical dry forests at the global scale, by combining a newly developed global distribution map with spatial data describing different threats, and to identify the relative exposure of different forest areas to such threats. Location: Global assessment. Methods: We present a new global distribution map of tropical dry forest derived from the recently developed MODIS Vegetation Continuous Fields (VCF) product, which depicts percentage tree cover at a resolution of 500 m, combined with previously defined maps of biomes. This distribution map was overlaid with spatial data to estimate the exposure of tropical dry forests to a number of different threats: climate change, habitat fragmentation, fire, human population density and conversion to cropland. The extent of tropical dry forest currently protected was estimated by overlaying the forest map with a global data set of the distribution of protected areas. Results: It is estimated that 1,048,700 km(2) of tropical dry forest remains, distributed throughout the three tropical regions. More than half of the forest area (54.2\%) is located within South America, the remaining area being almost equally divided between North and Central America, Africa and Eurasia, with a relatively small proportion (3.8\%) occurring within Australasia and Southeast Asia. Overall, c. 97\% of the remaining area of tropical dry forest is at risk from one or more of the threats considered, with highest percentages recorded for Eurasia. The relative exposure to different threats differed between regions: while climate change is relatively significant in the Americas, habitat fragmentation and fire affect a higher proportion of African forests, whereas agricultural conversion and human population density are most influential in Eurasia. Evidence suggests that c. 300,000 km(2) of tropical dry forest now coincide with some form of protected area, with 71.8\% of this total being located within South America. Main conclusions: Virtually all of the tropical dry forests that remain are currently exposed to a variety of different threats, largely resulting from human activity. Taking their high biodiversity value into consideration, this indicates that tropical dry forests should be accorded high conservation priority. The results presented here could be used to identify which forest areas should be accorded highest priority for conservation action. In particular, the expansion of the global protected area network, particularly in Mesoamerica, should be given urgent consideration.},

It is derived from a document prepared by TRAFFIC, the wildlife trade monitoring network, for the 14th meeting of the Conference of the Parties to CITES in June 2007. The volume of horn entering illegal trade from Africa has increased significantly since 2000, indicating ongoing market demand and organized trade routes to the Middle and Far East. Through law enforcement, range States collectively recovered 42\% of the potential number of rhino horns moving into illicit trade, but a minimum of 386 horns are believed to have evaded detection and were lost to illegal trade. Poached rhinos continue to supply most horns, with at least 252 rhinos detected as illegally killed during 2000-2005. However, prominence has been rising of horns acquired and laundered from private stockpiles and from legally hunted white rhinos in South Africa. With effective metapopulation management strategies, most range States in Africa have minimized poaching to levels at which their overall rhino populations continue to increase in numbers. Two notable exceptions are the Democratic Republic of Congo and Zimbabwe, where respectively 59\% and 12\% of their 2003 rhino populations were illegally killed during 2003-2005. Where illegal activities have escalated in key rhino range States, two important factors limiting management effectiveness are the increased levels of criminal organization and a breakdown of socio-economic stability and governance. TRAFFIC recommends renewed international attention following recent CITES decisions, with a focus on problems in DRC, South Africa and Zimbabwe.},

The detector was trained on annotated acoustic recordings from the Antarctic, and performance of the detector was assessed by calculating precision and recall using a separate independent dataset also from the Antarctic. Detections from both the human analyst and automated detector were then inspected by an independent judge to identify any calls missed by either approach and to adjudicate whether the apparent false-positive detections from the automated approach were actually true positives. A final performance assessment was conducted using double-observer methods (via a closed-population Huggins mark-recapture model) to assess the probability of detection of calls by both the human analyst and automated detector, based on the assumption of false-positive-free adjudicated detections. According to our double-observer analysis, the automated detector showed superior performance with higher recall and fewer false positives than the original human analyst, and with performance similar to existing top automated detectors. To understand the performance of both detectors we inspected the time-series and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of detections for the test dataset, and found that most of the advantages from the automated detector occurred at low and medium SNR.},

  abstract = {Spatial models of density and abundance are widely used in both ecological research (e.g., to study habitat use) and wildlife management (e.g., for population monitoring and environmental impact assessment). Increasingly, modellers are tasked with integrating data from multiple sources, collected via different observation processes. Distance sampling is an efficient and widely used survey and analysis technique. Within this framework, observation processes are modelled via detection functions. We seek to take multiple data sources and fit them in a single spatial model. Density surface models (DSMs) are a two-stage approach: first accounting for detectability via distance sampling methods, then modelling distribution via a generalized additive model. However, current software and theory does not address the issue of multiple data sources. We extend the DSM approach to accommodate data from multiple surveys, collected via conventional distance sampling, double-observer distance sampling (used to account for incomplete detection at zero distance) and strip transects. Variance propagation ensures that uncertainty is correctly accounted for in final estimates of abundance. Methods described here are implemented in the dsm R package. We briefly analyse two datasets to illustrate these new developments. Our new methodology enables data from multiple distance sampling surveys of different types to be treated in a single spatial model, enabling more robust abundance estimation, potentially over wider geographical or temporal domains.},

  abstract = {Assessing wildlife management action requires monitoring populations, and abundance often is the parameter monitored. Recent methodological advances have enabled estimation of mean abundance within a habitat using presence-absence or count data obtained via repeated visits to a sample of sites. These methods assume populations are closed and intuitively assume habitats within sites change little during a field season. However, many habitats are highly variable over short periods. We developed a variation of existing occupancy and abundance models that allows for extreme spatio-temporal differences in habitat, and resulting changes in wildlife abundance, among sites and among visits to a site within a field season. We conducted our study in sugarcane habitat within the Everglades Agricultural Area southeast of Lake Okeechobee in south Florida. We counted wintering birds, primarily passerines, within 245 sites usually 5 times at each site during December 2006-March 2007. We estimated occupancy and mean abundance of birds in 6 vegetation states during the sugarcane harvest and allowed these parameters to vary temporally or spatially within a vegetation state. Occupancy and mean abundance of the common yellowthroat (Geothlypis trichas) was affected by structure of sugarcane and uncultivated edge vegetation (occupancy = 1.00 [95\% CI = 0.96-1.00] and mean abundance = 7.9 [95\% CI = 3.2-19.5] in tall sugarcane with tall edge vegetation versus 0.20 [95\% CI = 0.04-0.71] and 0.22 [95\% CI = 0.04-1.2], respectively, in short sugarcane with short edge vegetation in one half of the study area). Occupancy and mean abundance of palm warblers (Dendroica palmarum) were constant (occupancy = 1.00, 95\% CI = 0.69-1.00; mean abundance = 18, 95\% CI = 1-270). Our model may enable wildlife managers to assess rigorously effects of future edge habitat management on avian distribution and abundance within agricultural landscapes during winter or the breeding season. The model may also help wildlife managers make similar management decisions involving other dynamic habitats such as wetlands, prairies, and even forested areas if forest management or fires occur during the field season.

  abstract = {Cooper's Hawks (Accipiter cooperii) have been extending their breeding range into urban areas, prompting questions about the relative importance of cities to the demography and conservation of these raptors. A key unanswered question is how urban subpopulations interact with their precedent exurban subpopulations. Two general models have been proposed to describe relationships among subpopulations in a metapopulation: (1) source-sink, where immigrants from sources sustain sinks; and (2) balanced dispersal, where dispersal is proportionally equal among subpopulations. I evaluated whether either of these models predict metapopulation dynamics of urban and exurban Cooper's Hawks in central New Mexico using demographic data in a Bayesian integrated population model. All urban female Cooper's Hawks began breeding in their first year; 69\% settled at nests in the urban subpopulation and 31\% emigrated and settled in an exurban subpopulation. The high rate of female emigration was likely because of a shortage of breeding urban males, caused by a 1 yr delay in male age-at-first-breeding. Emigration exceeded immigration by nearly 30\%, making a balanced-dispersal model implausible. Although the urban subpopulation was a source, the primary recipient subpopulation was not a sink; urban emigrants appeared to have a competitive advantage obtaining exurban nest sites. High urban winter prey abundance supported year-long residency among urban female Cooper's Hawks, whereas nearly all exurban females migrated. Resident urban females that emigrated settled on exurban nesting territories before migrants returned, and thus without direct competition from them. Previous metapopulation models do not incorporate the concept that differences in dispersal behavior between subpopulations can drive dispersal dynamics in a metapopulation. These findings provide further evidence that patch dynamics in a metapopulation can be complex, and may be governed by factors other than just demographic rates and connectivity.},

Strategies that meet a stock conservation criterion under a base case scenario are subjected to a set of robustness trials, including biased and highly variable abundance estimates and poaching. Strategy performance is assessed with respect to a conservation criterion, the revenues achieved and their variability. Strategies that harvest heavily, even when the population is apparently very large, perform badly in the robustness trials. Setting a threshold below which harvesting does not take place, and above which all individuals are harvested, does not provide effective protection against over-harvesting. Strategies that rely on population growth rates rather than estimates of population size are more robust to biased estimates. The strategies that are most robust to uncertainty are simple, involving harvesting a relatively small proportion of the population each year. The simulation modelling approach to exploring harvesting strategies is suggested as a useful tool for the assessment of the performance of competing strategies under uncertainty.},

  abstract = {Most birds sleep while roosting at night. Although a widespread behavior, few investigators have studied the nocturnal roosting behavior of birds. Studies conducted to date have either focused on species that roost communally or used radio-telemetry to locate sleeping individuals of a few focal species. Portable thermal cameras capable of detecting infrared (IR) heat signals may provide a more efficient and less invasive means of detecting nocturnal-roosting endotherms such as birds. Our objective was to assess the efficacy of using thermal cameras to detect roosting birds in a woodland bird community in southeastern Australia. To better understand the limitations of using thermography to detect roosting birds, paired bird surveys were conducted along 44 transects from May to September 2016 using both traditional survey techniques during the day and surveys with a thermal camera at night. We detected 195 birds representing 21 species at nocturnal roosts using IR thermography, with the detection rate of birds during nocturnal surveys approximately one-third (29.1\%) that during diurnal surveys. Detection rates during nocturnal surveys declined more steeply with distance from observers than for diurnal surveys. Detection rates were significantly higher during diurnal surveys for 14 species of woodland birds, but did not differ between diurnal and nocturnal surveys for eight other species. Roost height, roost visibility, bird mass, and cluster size (i.e., two or more birds in physical contact) did not differ between species categorized as having high or low detectability during nocturnal surveys. Variability among species in nocturnal-detectability could not be attributed to roost-site visibility, roost height, or bird size. Positive detection biases associated with diurnal behavior, such as movement and vocalizations, and limitations of current IR technology, e.g., low resolution, likely contributed to overall lower detection rates during nocturnal surveys. However, our results suggest that infrared thermography can be an effective and useful technique for detecting roosting birds and studying roosting behavior, as well as for population monitoring under certain conditions.},

Furthermore, while the complexities of the detection process from motion sensor photography are generally acknowledged, viewable area (the common factor between motion sensor and time lapse photography) on its own has been underemphasized. We establish a common set of terminology to identify the component parts of viewshed area, contrast the photographic capture process and area measurements for time lapse and motion sensor photography, and review methods for estimating viewable area in the field. We use a case study to demonstrate the importance of accurate estimates of viewable area on abundance estimates. Time lapse photography combined with accurate measurements of viewable area allow researchers to assume that capture probability equals 1.

  abstract = {Distance sampling from aerial platforms can provide researchers with precise and efficient density estimates for wildlife populations, particularly over large areas. The intensity of the distance sampling survey depends on the survey effort. Effort can be referred to as coverage, where transect spacing is determined by the observer's sightability distance of the object or animal. Managers and researchers in Texas often use helicopters to survey and collect data for northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus) density estimates. For bobwhites, 100\% coverage represents transect spacing of 200 m, assuming observers can cover out to 100 m on either side of the transects. Often surveys are conducted at 50\% coverage or 400 m spacing to reduce cost. Still, the implications of lowering survey effort on the precision of density estimates are unknown, particularly in coverage prescriptions. We flew 2,641 km of line transects each December from 2014 to 2017 and detected 2,333 bobwhite coveys across 7,648 ha of rangeland on the San Antonio Viejo Ranch in Jim Hogg County, TX, USA. We conducted line-transect distance sampling from a helicopter platform at 50 and 100\% coverage and simulated results at coverage {$<$}50\% using empirical data. Based on the results of simulated surveys at {$<$}100\% coverage, surveying for bobwhites using helicopters with less than 50\% coverage results in variable density estimates (wide 95\% confidence intervals) and low precision (coefficient of variation {$>$}20\%). Empirical surveys conducted at 50 and 100\% coverage show little variation in density estimates between the 2 levels of coverage. However, when broken into substrata (areas less than 1,000 ha), conducting surveys at 50\% coverage resulted in {$<$}60 detections, which led to low precision in density estimates (coefficient of variation {$>$}20\%). Our results are based on surveys conducted at the juncture of the Coastal Sand Sheet and Tamaulipan Thorn Scrub ecoregions in south Texas and need to be evaluated in other arid and semi-arid rangeland systems.},

  abstract = {For point-count data to reliably index bird abundance or density, estimates must be corrected for variation in detection probabilities across species, observers, and environmental conditions. Removal and double-observer modeling are two recently developed statistical techniques for estimating detection probabilities and bird abundance. We collected point-count data in north-central Indiana and used a Huggins closed-capture model in MARK to directly compare those two methods. We found that when detection probabilities were relatively high for individual observers, the two methods yielded similar estimates of density for nearly all 17 species modeled. However, when true detection probabilities for observers were relatively low, removal estimates of delectability and density were biased high and low, respectively, perhaps because of the effect of low-detection probability on the removal estimator or smaller sample sizes associated with less-skilled observers. In general, we consider removal modeling a more desirable approach than double-observer modeling because it requires half as many observers, allows more sources of variation in detectability to be modeled, and estimates abundance or density of the true population of birds. By contrast, double-observer modeling estimates only the abundance of the “apparent” population (i.e. those birds that are visually or audibly conspicuous). For species that vocalize infrequently or are otherwise elusive, the apparent population may be significantly smaller than the true population. However, double-observer modeling is more robust to violations of the assumption of population closure and may outperform removal methods when data are collected by less-experienced observers.},

  abstract = {Winter cave and mine surveys have been the primary method to monitor status of bat populations but they are not equally effective across regions or species. Many species of bats that roost in rock outcrops during the nonhibernation period are difficult for researchers to monitor with existing methods. Although some wildlife biologists have speculated visual surveys could be used to monitor populations of bats roosting on talus slopes, they did not know the efficacy of the method. We used standardized plot-based visual surveys to quantify presence and abundance of eastern small-footed bats Myotis leibii on talus slopes in Virginia, and studied sources of variation and error. Detection probability for talus surveys was relatively high but varied based on search effort and site characteristics. Both abundance and detection probability varied more among plots within sites than among sites or years. In trials with radio-tagged bats to study the causes of false negatives, 18\% of bats roosted where surveyors could not see them, and 18\% of bats were visible but overlooked due to human error. Less experienced surveyors counted slightly fewer bats than the principal investigator, we suspect because the principal investigator simply found the bats first. There also was a slight learning curve among less experienced observers. Visual surveys have strong potential to aid in the study of bats that roost on talus slopes. Talus surveys, unlike longer-established methods to monitor bat populations, provide ways to assess error. We recommend using talus surveys to monitor other rock-roosting bat species with poorly understood populations, such as many species in western North America.},

  abstract = {Game species monitoring using road based distance sampling in association with thermal imagers: a covariate analysis.-Monitoring of game species populations is necessary to adequately assess culling by hunters in areas where natural large predators are absent. However, game managers have to control several species and they often lack of an efficient and convenient survey design method. Monitoring several species at that same time over large areas could thus be cost- and time-effective. We tested the influence of several factors during monitoring of three common game species, (wild boar, roe deer and red fox, using road based distance sampling in association with thermal imagers. This pilot survey based on 20 night counts in five contrasting sites studied the effect of several covariates (species, thermal imaging, observer, group size, and habitat type) on the detection probabilities (= dp). No differences were observed between thermal imagers (do(JENOPTIK): 0-186, dP(FLIR): 0.193) and group sizes (dp(1ind): 0.243, dp(2ind) : 0.259, dp({$>$}2ind): 0.223), but we found differences between observers (dp(obs1): 0.207, dp(obs2): 0.274, dp(obs3): 0.159). Expected differences were also observed between species (dp(wild boar): 0.22, dp(roe deer): 0.35, dp(red fox): 0.32) and between habitat type (dp(forest): 0.27, dp(edge): 0.74, dp(open): 0.35). Our results show that the detectability of low cost thermal imaging equipment is similar to that of more expensive methods, highlighting new possibilities for the use of thermal imagery by game managers. Although adjustments should be made to the study design our findings suggest that large scale multi species monitoring could be an efficient method for common game species.},

In the context of forest management and avian conservation, wetland classification presents an opportunity to classify and investigate wetland bird communities. We compared bird communities among a suite of eight wetland classes in the southern Boreal Plains ecozone of Manitoba and tested whether wetland classification was a useful tool for delineating habitat for birds. To provide context for how wetlands fit into a managed forest setting, we compared wetland classes with structurally similar harvested deciduous and mixedwood stands early in succession (5-7 years) to assess potential overlap in community composition. We conducted fixed-radius (100 m) point counts across 83 sites and used a combination of multivariate techniques to determine whether individual wetland classes supported characteristic bird assemblages and species. Our study suggests using established approaches to classifying wetlands will be helpful for documenting the full breadth of habitats used by boreal birds. Given ongoing industrial development, particularly in the boreal plains ecozone, further research is needed to determine effects of human disturbance and support the conservation of a full spectrum of wetland classes in the boreal landscape.},

  abstract = {The Rufous-crowned Sparrow (Aimophila ruficeps) is a nonmigratory passerine that displays an area-sensitive distribution pattern of abundance in fragmented coastal sage-scrub habitat of southern California. To determine if habitat fragmentation negatively affected adult survival, we used Cormack-Jolly-Seber models to compare annual survival probabilities of adult sparrows breeding in habitat adjacent to urban-developed edges to those of birds breeding in the interior of large habitat expanses in San Diego County, 1997-2000. During that period, an El Nino event brought heavy rainfall to the study area, and a La Nina event brought drought. Annual survival probabilities were relatively high for a small passerine (females: 0.69 +/- 0.05 SE; males: 0.74 +/- 0.04 SE) but, given our data, did not differ between habitat types or with rainfall. Annual resighting probabilities for the birds were strongly associated with variation in rainfall, being high in the wet year and low in the dry year. Mate- and site-fidelity were apparently high, and surveys during the nonbreeding season documented that the sparrows stayed paired and on territories year-round. We hypothesize that the high apparent survivorship of this species is related to its nonmigratory habit and its tendency to curtail reproductive effort during periods of food scarcity. Although Our survivorship analysis suggests that the urban-wildland interface does not adversely affect survival of territorial Rufous-crowned Sparrows, our power to detect an effect of habitat edge on survival was low. Thus, we urge caution in concluding that edge effects do not have an ecologically important influence on survival rates in this species.},

  abstract = {The traditional sampling method for estimating frequency (the number of sub-quadrats containing a basal part of the organisms) is compared, using both computer simulations and direct comparison in the field, to two new methods that use a compound series of variable-sized concentric sub-quadrats. Both the new frequency-score and the new importance-score methods are closer approximations of density than is the standard frequency method, and the estimates produced by both of the new methods are less affected by the choice of sub-quadrat size and the spatial distribution (dispersion) of the organisms (i.e. clumping and regularity). Thus, the two nested-quadrat methods appear to ameliorate the usual frequency limitations associated with sub-quadrat size and organism dispersion, by the use of a range of different sub-quadrat sizes. This is important in community studies, where the component species may show a wide range of densities and dispersions. Both of the new methods are easily employed in the field. The importance-score method involves no more sampling effort than does standard qualitative (presenceabsence) sampling, and it can therefore be used to sample a larger quadrat area than would normally be used for frequency sampling. This makes the method much more cost-effective as a means of estimating abundance, and it allows a greater number of the rarer species to be included in the sampling. The frequency-score method is more time-consuming, but it is capable of detecting more subtle community patterns. This means that it is particularly useful for the study of species-poor communities or where small variations in composition need to be detected.},

  abstract = {In this essay, I make the case that our studies of wildlife and habitat are largely decoupled from any meaningful relationship to the distribution of the study species. The field that we broadly classify as wildlifehabitat relationships is characterized by an increasing number of studies that gather additional data on phenomena that are already well studied. I offer that unless we make changes to the fundamental aspect of study design, our studies will fail to advance conservation of species. The current habitat sampling and analysis paradigm involves identification of a convenient study area, drawing samples from the usual list of parameters, conducting a series of statistical analyses, comparing findings to other studies, and justifying publication by extrapolating findings to some unspecified larger area. Recommendations for management are usually vague and are seldom tested for efficacy. Most of our habitat studies have little relevance to the target species with regard to viability. Attempts to translate the best scientific information into a set of management guidelines for a species produce one size fits all documents. I describe how we usually compromise our studies well before data collection by failing to establish a cogent framework for sampling from an ecologically meaningful unit of a population, but rather sample based on funding priorities and convenience. Specifying the sampling universe for a species sets the stage for properly establishing the sampling frame. Although we always have a target population, that target is often the result of personal, political, or administrative interest, but has little to do with biological reality. I review various intraspecies levels that could be a focus for study, including subspecies and especially ecotypes. Although making assumptions about our study species and habitat parameters is a necessary step, carrying forward untested assumptions from previous studies and failing to test new ones substantially negates the application of research results to meaningful management actions. I include recommendations for enhancing studies of wildlife and habitat with the intent of altering the current norm of wildlifehabitat studies. (c) 2012 The Wildlife Society.},

The relationship between measurements of dung bolus and age was particularly strong when growth rates were high (age 0–25 years). The dung bolus growth curve from Amboseli elephants was similar to that derived from another wild population of African elephants, suggesting that dung bolus diameter can be used to assess age structure in areas where it is impossible to construct independent prediction curves of age and dung bolus.},

For this study, bird call data was collected using automated acoustic recording devices (ARDs) over a 3-year period. We then compared the results from experienced ornithologists who independently identified bird calls from the same samples. Results were highly variable. The level of agreement between processors on identification for some species was high (e.g. tomtit Petroica macrocephala, 85.1\%), whilst for others it was considerably lower (e.g. song thrush Turdus philomelos, 23.5\%). There was no statistically significant difference in agreement between native and non-native species. However, there was some evidence for improvement in agreement for the third survey season, when compared to the first. In a more specific comparison of bellbird Anthornis melanura and tui Prosthemadera novaeseelandiae calls, our results showed that these two species were frequently confused. There were many instances where only one of the processors identified a species. Possible explanations for why calls were missed include differences in hearing ability and levels of concentration between processors, whilst false positives could have resulted from confirmation bias. These results have implications not only for data collected using recording devices but also field-based counts of birds conducted by observers.},

Detailed population sampling was carried out in two geographically distinct locations where populations appeared to be extant. Evidence of N. fuscus was found throughout the Strzelecki Desert east and south of the Strzelecki Creek in South Australia and in an isolated group of dunes south-east of the Diamantina River in south-west Queensland. Populations were located in a variety of sand dune habitats (excepting those dominated by Triodia) throughout these areas, implying that the species is a habitat-generalist with a preference for a sandy substrate. Eight floristic groups were identified from the 66 sites sampled, three of which supported N. fuscus populations. These ranged from extremely degraded dune and sand plain systems in the southern Strzelecki Desert, supporting mostly ephemeral plants, to well-vegetated dunes covered by sandhill canegrass,Zygochloa paradoxa, in south-west Queensland. However, the results suggest that the presence of consolidated dunes and perennial vegetation are important for the maintenance of stable populations. Relatively dense populations of N. fuscus were recorded only in the vicinity of major drainage systems. It is hypothesised that the higher nutrient status of the soils surrounding such systems may be an important factor affecting the distribution of N. fuscus. The study reaffirmed the species’ decline since European settlement of Australia, and recommends that the present vulnerable status of the species (IUCN Species Survival Commission (SSC) Rodent Specialist Group) be maintained.},

Population parameters of N. fuscus differed markedly between the two study sites. Whilst the population at Montecollina Bore exhibited large fluctuations in size, captures at Pelican Waterhole were lower but more consistent. Recaptures between sessions at Montecollina Bore peaked at 60\% but no individuals were recaptured at Pelican Waterhole. No evidence of seasonal breeding was recorded at either site. Male N. fuscus captured at Montecollina Bore were significantly heavier (average 31.4 g) than Pelican Waterhole animals (average 26.6 g). Over a 1–4-night period, the maximum linear distance moved by radio-collared individuals was 1.5 km (average 481 m) at Pelican Waterhole and 400 m (average 199 m) at Montecollina Bore. Differences in population dynamics between the two sites are ascribed to food availability and habitat quality. Whilst Pelican Waterhole may constitute a more stable, less degraded environment, Montecollina Bore appears to be defined by periods of either very high or very low resource availability depending on rainfall. The abundance of dingoes and low cat and fox activity may contribute to the persistence of N. fuscus at the two study sites.},

  abstract = {Habitat modeling across a landscape that has gradients of habitat conditions requires potential predictor data that can be quantified at biologically relevant scales. We used remotely sensed data to develop a multi-scale density model in 2018 for the golden-cheeked warbler (Setophaga chrysoparia; warbler), a species that breeds in Ashe juniper (Juniperus ashei)-oak (Quercus spp.) woodlands in central Texas, USA. We first classified Ashe juniper and broadleaf tree cover at a 1-m resolution and used this to map potential habitat across the warbler's {$>$}67,000-km2 breeding range. We then designed a survey for estimating warbler density based on hierarchical distance sampling. We used stratified random sampling to survey for male warblers at 1,804 points across the continuum of tree canopy cover and composition and detected 810 warblers during our surveys. We developed a suite of potential predictor variables for modeling warbler density that reflected vegetation, topography, climate, and anthropogenic land use conditions across the breeding range and developed these at 3 scales representing the territory, site, and landscape. We modeled warbler density and used the best fit model to produce a spatially explicit estimate. Predicted warbler density was influenced by tree canopy cover and canopy height at the territory scale (100-m radius); tree canopy cover, percent of the canopy comprised of juniper, and an interaction between canopy cover and compound topographic index at the site scale (1-km radius); and annual temperature range at the landscape scale (5-km radius). We estimated a population size of 217,444 male warblers (95\% CI = 153,917–311,965) and {$>$}3,000 males in each recovery unit. After controlling for the duration of point count surveys, our estimate of population size was similar to that reported from the only previous breeding range survey conducted in 2008–2009. Our model results indicated that management activities to increase warbler density should promote woodlands with high tree canopy cover, approximately 60–80\% Ashe juniper composition, and tree heights {$>$}3 m. In contrast to a patch-based approach, our treatment of habitat variables as continuous helped to credibly map the warbler distribution across areas with broad transitions from woodlands to shrublands. By measuring these predictor variables at biologically relevant scales, we allowed the warbler survey data to define habitat relationships instead of using anthropogenically defined habitat patches. Outcomes from our study show the benefits of developing spatial products tailored to individual species of interest for conservation and management decisions.},

  abstract = {Tropical forests host at least two-thirds of the world’s flora and fauna diversity and store 25\% of the terrestrial above and belowground carbon. However, biodiversity decline due to deforestation and forest degradation of tropical forest is increasing at an alarming rate. Biodiversity dynamics due to natural and anthropogenic disturbances are mainly monitored using established field survey approaches. However, such approaches appear to fall short at addressing complex disturbance factors and responses. We argue that the integration of state-of-the-art monitoring approaches can improve the detection of subtle biodiversity disturbances and responses in changing tropical forests, which are often data-poor. We assess the state-of-the-art technologies used to monitor biodiversity dynamics of changing tropical forests, and how their potential integration can increase the detail and accuracy of biodiversity monitoring. Moreover, the relevance of these biodiversity monitoring techniques in support of the UNCBD Aichi targets was explored using the Essential Biodiversity Variables (EBVs) as a framework. Our review indicates that although established field surveys were generally the dominant monitoring systems employed, the temporal trend of monitoring approaches indicates the increasing application of remote sensing and in -situ sensors in detecting disturbances related to agricultural activities, logging, hunting and infrastructure. The relevance of new technologies (i.e., remote sensing, in situ sensors, and DNA barcoding) in operationalising EBVs (especially towards the ecosystem structure, ecosystem function, and species population classes) and the Aichi targets has been assessed. Remote sensing application is limited for EBV classes such as genetic composition and species traits but was found most suitable for ecosystem structure class. The complementarity of remote sensing and emerging technologies were shown in relation to EBV candidates such as species distribution, net primary productivity, and habitat structure. We also developed a framework based on the primary biodiversity attributes, which indicated the potential of integration between monitoring approaches. In situ sensors are suitable to help measure biodiversity composition, while approaches based on remote sensing are powerful for addressing structural and functional biodiversity attributes. We conclude that, synergy between the recent biodiversity monitoring approaches is important and possible. However, testing the suitability of monitoring methods across scales, integrating heterogeneous monitoring technologies, setting up metadata standards, and making interpolation and/or extrapolation from observation at different scales is still required to design a robust biodiversity monitoring system that can contribute to effective conservation measures.},

  abstract = {Roadside point counts are often used to estimate trends of bird populations. The use of aural counts of birds without adjustment for detection probability, however, can lead to incorrect population trend estimates. We compared precision of estimates of density and detectability of whistling northern bobwhites (Colinus virginianus) using distance sampling, independent double-observer, and removal methods from roadside surveys. Two observers independently recorded each whistling bird heard, distance from the observer, and time of first detection at 362 call-count stops in Ohio. We examined models that included covariates for year and observer effects for each method and distance from observer effects for the double-observer and removal methods using Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC). The best model of detectability from distance sampling included observer and year effects. The best models from the removal and double-observer techniques included observer and distance effects. All 3 methods provided precise estimates of detection probability (CV = 2.4-4.4\%) with a range of detectability of 0.44-0.95 for a 6-min survey. Density estimates from double-observer surveys had the lowest coefficient of variation (2005 = 3.2\%, 2006 = 1.7\%), but the removal method also provided precise estimates of density (2005 CV = 3.4\%, 2006 CV = 4.8\%), and density estimates from distance sampling were less precise (2005 CV = 9.6\%, 2006 CV = 7.9\%). Assumptions of distance sampling were violated in our study because probability of detecting bobwhites near the observer was ¡1 or the roadside survey points were not randomly distributed with respect to the birds. Distances also were not consistently recorded by individual members of observer pairs. Although double-observer surveys provided more precise estimates, we recommend using the removal method to estimate detectability and abundance of bobwhites. The removal method provided precise estimates of density and detection probability and requires half the personnel time as double-observer surveys. Furthermore, the likelihood of meeting model assumptions is higher for the removal survey than with independent double-observers. (C) 2011 The Wildlife Society.},

  abstract = {Context. The most common methods to estimate detection probability during avian point-count surveys involve recording a distance between the survey point and individual birds detected during the survey period. Accurately measuring or estimating distance is an important assumption of these methods; however, this assumption is rarely tested in the context of aural avian point-count surveys. Aims. We expand on recent bird-simulation studies to document the error associated with estimating distance to calling birds in a wetland ecosystem. Methods. We used two approaches to estimate the error associated with five surveyor's distance estimates between the survey point and calling birds, and to determine the factors that affect a surveyor's ability to estimate distance. Key results. We observed biased and imprecise distance estimates when estimating distance to simulated birds in a point-count scenario ((x) over bar (error) = -9m, s.d.(error) = 47m) and when estimating distances to real birds during field trials ((x) over bar (error) = 39m, s.d.(error) = 79 m). The amount of bias and precision in distance estimates differed among surveyors; surveyors with more training and experience were less biased and more precise when estimating distance to both real and simulated birds. Three environmental factors were important in explaining the error associated with distance estimates, including the measured distance from the bird to the surveyor, the volume of the call and the species of bird. Surveyors tended to make large overestimations to birds close to the survey point, which is an especially serious error in distance sampling. Conclusions. Our results suggest that distance-estimation error is prevalent, but surveyor training may be the easiest way to reduce distance-estimation error. Implications. The present study has demonstrated how relatively simple field trials can be used to estimate the error associated with distance estimates used to estimate detection probability during avian point-count surveys. Evaluating distance-estimation errors will allow investigators to better evaluate the accuracy of avian density and trend estimates. Moreover, investigators who evaluate distance-estimation errors could employ recently developed models to incorporate distance-estimation error into analyses. We encourage further development of such models, including the inclusion of such models into distance-analysis software.},

  abstract = {Stochastic versions of Gompertz, Ricker, and various other dynamics models play a fundamental role in quantifying strength of density dependence and studying long-term dynamics of wildlife populations. These models are frequently estimated using time series of abundance estimates that are inevitably subject to observation error and missing data. This issue can be addressed with a state-space modeling framework that jointly estimates the observed data model and the underlying stochastic population dynamics (SPD) model. In cases where abundance data are from multiple locations with a smaller spatial resolution (e.g., from mark-recapture and distance sampling studies), models are conventionally fitted to spatially pooled estimates of yearly abundances. Here, we demonstrate that a spatial version of SPD models can be directly estimated from short time series of spatially referenced distance sampling data in a unified hierarchical state-space modeling framework that also allows for spatial variance (covariance) in population growth. We also show that a full range of likelihood based inference, including estimability diagnostics and model-selection, is feasible in this class of models using a data cloning algorithm. We further show through simulation experiments that the hierarchical state--space framework introduced herein efficiently captures the underlying dynamical parameters and spatial abundance distribution. We apply our methodology by analyzing a time series of line-transect distance sampling data for fin whales (Balaenoptera physalus) off the U.S. west coast. Although there were only seven surveys conducted during the study time frame, 1991-2014, our analysis detected presence of strong density regulation and provided reliable estimates of fin whale densities. In summary, we show that the integrative framework developed herein allows ecologists to better infer key population characteristics such as presence of density regulation and spatial variability in a population's intrinsic growth potential.},

Most gibbons are threatened due to deforestation. We studied the western hoolock gibbon (Hoolock hoolock) in Bangladesh to determine population size and extent of suitable habitat. We used distance sampling to estimate density across 22 sites in northeastern and southeastern Bangladesh. We used Maxent modeling to determine areas of highly suitable habitat throughout Bangladesh. Density was estimated to be 0.39 \& PLUSMN; 0.09groups/km(2), and the total estimated population was 468.96 \& PLUSMN; 45.56 individuals in 135.31 \& PLUSMN; 2.23 groups. The Maxent model accurately predicted gibbon distribution. Vegetation cover, isothermality, annual precipitation, elevation and mean temperature of the warmest quarter influenced distribution. Two areas in the northeast and two areas in the southeast have high potential for gibbon conservation in Bangladesh. We also found significantly more gibbons in areas that had some level of official protection. Thus, we suggest careful evaluation, comprehensive surveys and restoration of habitats identified as suitable for gibbons. We recommend bringing specific sites in the northeastern and southeastern regions under protection to secure habitat for remaining gibbon populations.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Although much research has been done to improve the precision of nest-surveys, trade-offs between data-reliability and research-efficiency have not been solved. In this study, we used different approaches to assess the landscape-scale distribution patterns of great apes. We conducted a conventional nest survey and a camera-trap survey concurrently, and checked the consistency of the estimates. We divided the study area (ca. 500km(2)), containing various types of vegetation and topography, into thirty 16-km(2) grids (4kmx4km) and performed both methods along 2-km transects centered in each grid. We determined the nest creator species according to the definitions by Tutin \& Fernandez [Tutin \& Fernandez, 1984, Am J Primatol 6:313-336] and estimated nest-site densities of each species by using the conventional distance-sampling approach. We calculated the mean capture rate of 3 camera traps left for 3 months at each grid as the abundance index. Our analyses showed that both methods provided roughly consistent results for the distribution patterns of the species; chimpanzee groups (parties) were more abundant in the montane forest, and gorilla groups were relatively homogeneously distributed across vegetation types. The line-transect survey also showed that the number of nests per nest site did not vary among vegetation types for either species. These spatial patterns seemed to reflect the ecological and sociological features of each species. Although the consistent results may be largely dependent on site-specific conditions (e.g., high density of each species, distinct distribution pattern between the two species), conventional nest-surveys and a subsequent check of their consistency with independent estimates may be a reasonable approach to obtain certain information on the species distribution patterns. Further analytical improvement is necessary for camera-traps to be considered a stand-alone method. Am. J. Primatol. 75:1220-1230, 2013. (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

  abstract = {Camera traps are a powerful tool for wildlife surveys. However, camera traps may not always detect animals passing in front. This constraint may create a substantial bias in estimating critical parameters such as the density of unmarked populations. We proposed the 'double-observer approach' with camera traps to counter the constraint, which involves setting up a paired camera trap at a station and correcting imperfect detection with a reformulated hierarchical capture-recapture model for stratified populations. We performed simulations to evaluate this approach's reliability and determine how to obtain desirable data for this approach. We then applied it to 12 mammals in Japan and Cameroon. The results showed that the model assuming a beta-binomial distribution as detection processes could correct imperfect detection as long as paired camera traps detect animals nearly independently (Correlation coefficient\,≤\,0.2). Camera traps should be installed to monitor a predefined small focal area from different directions to satisfy this requirement. The field surveys showed that camera trap could miss animals by 3–40\%, suggesting that current density estimation models relying on perfect detection may underestimate animal density by the same order of magnitude. We hope that our approach will be incorporated into existing density estimation models to improve their accuracy.},

  abstract = {1. Efficient and reliable methods for estimating animal density are essential to wildlife conservation and management. Camera trapping is an increasingly popular tool in this area of wildlife research, with further potential arising from technological improvements, such as video-recording functions that allow for behavioural observation of animals. This information may be useful in the estimation of animal density, even without individual recognition. Although several models applicable to species lacking individual markings (i.e. unmarked populations) have been developed, a methodology incorporating behavioural information from videos has not yet been established. 2. We developed a likelihood-based model: the random encounter and staying time (REST) model. It is an extension of the random encounter model by Rowcliffe et al. (J Appl Ecol 45: 1228, 2008). The REST model describes the relationship among staying time, trapping rate, and density, which is estimable using a frequentist or Bayesian approach. We tested the reliability and feasibility of the REST model using Monte Carlo simulations. We also applied the approach in the African rainforest and compared the results with those of a line-transect survey. 3. The simulations showed that the REST model provided unbiased estimates of animal density. Even when animal movement speeds varied among individuals, and when animals travelled in pairs, the model provided unbiased density estimates. However, the REST model was vulnerable to unsynchronized activity patterns among individuals. Moreover, it is necessary to use a camera model with a fast and reliable infrared sensor and to set the camera trap's parameters appropriately (i.e. video length, delay period). The field survey showed that the staying time of two ungulate species in the African rainforest exhibited good fit with a temporal parametric distribution, and the REST model provided density estimates consistent with those of a line-transect survey. 4. Synthesis and applications. The random encounter and staying time model provides better efficiency and higher feasibility than the random encounter model in estimating animal density without individual recognition. Careful application of the random encounter and staying time model provides the potential to estimate density of many ground-dwelling vertebrates lacking individually recognizable markings, and thus should be an effective method for population monitoring.},

  abstract = {In cities, species have to endure severe biotic and abiotic changes in their surroundings, along with various anthropogenic pressures. In recent years, urban dwellers have declined throughout the world, including the most successful urban adapters- House Sparrow and Tree Sparrow. We studied how the population and habitat use of sparrows varied at different urban habitats (city outskirts, followed by residential and highly crowded commercial zones) of Guwahati, India. We carried out point counts using distance sampling to estimate the density of sparrows. We found that sparrows were largely associated with complex urban structures, and the density of sparrows significantly differed between species amongst the habitat. House Sparrow density was three-fold of Tree Sparrow, and the occurrence of both the species was highest at mid-level of urbanization. Tree sparrow had low density compared to House Sparrow in areas where urbanization peaked. Unlike Tree Sparrow, the habitat-specific detection for House Sparrow did not vary significantly. The detectability of Tree Sparrow was higher in residential buildings. The Manly Selectivity ratio for the preference and avoidance of different habitats showed that House Sparrows occupied commercial areas and a combination of commercial-residential sectors more than available and avoided areas with a low level of urbanization (city outskirts). Tree sparrows significantly preferred human habitation dominated by residential houses. We estimated around four hundred thousand sparrows (House Sparrow: 253,615-357,454; Tree Sparrow: 32,882-163,533) in Guwahati. The present study creates a baseline information for the sparrow population and habitat use in Guwahati City, and provides emphasis for maintaining (mid-level urbanized) areas where both the species are abundant.},

  abstract = {Point counts are commonly used to assess changes in bird abundance, including analytical approaches such as distance sampling that estimate density. Point-count methods have come under increasing scrutiny because effects of detection probability and field error are difficult to quantify. For seven forest songbirds, we compared fixed-radii counts (50 m and 100 m) and density estimates obtained from distance sampling to known numbers of birds determined by territory mapping. We applied point-count analytic approaches to a typical forest management question and compared results to those obtained by territory mapping. We used a before-after control impact (BACI) analysis with a data set collected across seven study areas in the central Appalachians from 2006 to 2010. Using a 50-m fixed radius, variance in error was at least 1.5 times that of the other methods, whereas a 100-m fixed radius underestimated actual density by ¿3 territories per 10 ha for the most abundant species. Distance sampling improved accuracy and precision compared to fixed-radius counts, although estimates were affected by birds counted outside 10-ha units. In the BACI analysis, territory mapping detected an overall treatment effect for five of the seven species, and effects were generally consistent each year. In contrast, all point-count methods failed to detect two treatment effects due to variance and error in annual estimates. Overall, our results highlight the need for adequate sample sizes to reduce variance, and skilled observers to reduce the level of error in point-count data. Ultimately, the advantages and disadvantages of different survey methods should be considered in the context of overall study design and objectives, allowing for trade-offs among effort, accuracy, and power to detect treatment effects.},

We compared density estimates derived from these techniques to those derived from labour-intensive capture-recapture techniques. Distance sampling and capture-recapture techniques produced comparable density estimates at medium and low hare densities. Density estimates derived from distance sampling were higher than those derived from capture-recapture in high-density hare populations. Both distance sampling and capture-recapture techniques gave wide confidence intervals at high hare density. Histograms of perpendicular sighting distances showed that a large proportion of hares were seen on or close to the transect line and that there was a rapid fall off in detection rates with distance. This finding indicated that hare behaviour may lead to problematic survey design and may reduce the precision of density estimates. The collection of accurate distance sampling data was particularly problematic when hare density was high. In contrast, in low-density hare populations, considerable sampling effort was required to obtain sufficient sightings of hares to reliably estimate density. Dung plots provided a relative index of abundance that successfully ranked populations of mountain hares in order of increasing density as determined by distance sampling and capture-recapture techniques. With careful study design, distance sampling provides a good compromise between accuracy, precision and effort in estimating the density of mountain hares. The use of dung plots is a rapid alternative when only estimates of relative abundance are required.},

  abstract = {1. Chaparral, a type of shrubland common throughout the California Floristic Province, is subject to management and removal in regions where wildfire threatens human lives and property. Management practices include conducting prescribed burns outside of the historical fire season and employing mechanical fuel reduction (mastication). As the wildland-urban interface grows, particularly in coastal California, more of this ecosystem is subject to active management. 2. To understand the ecological implications of current California chaparral fire management practices, we studied bird species composition, abundance and foraging guilds in managed and unmanaged chaparral over 5 years. Study areas were located in Mendocino County in the coast ranges of northern California. We contrast six chaparral removal or “fuels manipulation” treatments: (1) fall fire, (2) winter fire, (3) spring fire, (4) fall mastication, (5) spring mastication and (6) untreated control. Treatments and controls were implemented in plots 2 ha or larger, and replicated four times each. 3. We find that species richness in prescribed fire treatments reaches comparable levels to controls in the first 3 years following treatment, whereas masticated units always have lower species richness. Generalized linear mixed models additionally confirm that mastication has highly negative effects on observed abundances of birds compared to controls and to prescribed fire. 4. The season in which fuels reduction occurred was less important to species richness, although fall fire was more beneficial to bird abundance than spring or winter fire. Fire treatments in all seasons maintain the same general bird community structure as controls, while mastication results in strongly differentiated assemblages, increasing granivores while nearly excluding foliage gleaners. 5. Synthesis and applications. We compare two California chaparral management techniques, prescribed fire and mastication, in three seasons (fall, winter and spring) in northern California, USA. We tracked chaparral bird community response in 23 experimental units for 2-5 years. We conclude that prescribed fire and mastication are not interchangeable management techniques, and that mastication negatively impacts bird communities, altering guild structure and reducing both diversity and abundance.},

  abstract = {Methods Line transect data collected by volunteers in 1998 from 2287 1-km squares across the UK were analysed using distance sampling methods to calculate habitat-specific density and abundance estimates. For each species, the habitat-specific decline in detectability with distance from a transect line was modelled and applied at a regional level to incorporate variation in sampling intensity in different areas of the country. Results National population and density estimates calculated here were at a magnitude expected for at least seven species in this study. However, national population size estimates were higher than expected for Starling Sturnus vulgaris, House Sparrow Passer domesticus, Blackbird Turdus merula, Greenfinch Carduelis chloris, Jackdaw Corvus monedula, Whitethroat Sylvia communis, Woodpigeon Columba palumbus and Linnet Carduelis cannabina and lower than expected for Skylark Alauda arvensis, Dunnock Prunella modularis, Song Thrush Turdus philomelos and Corn Bunting Miliaria calandra. These differences are likely to be related to differences in sampling design and survey methods. For example, Starling, House Sparrow, Blackbird, Jackdaw, Greenfinch and Wood Pigeon, which have considerable populations in urban areas, were undoubtedly underestimated by the Common Birds Census (CBC). The counts of species that flock during the breeding season, or are not strongly territorial (e.g. Linnet, Jackdaw and Wood Pigeon) could be biased if detectability is strongly related to flock size. National population estimates of Skylark and Corn Bunting are lower than those based on CBC, but higher, or similar, to targeted national surveys of these species. Possible reasons for the differences between these estimates are considered. Conclusions This study highlights the strength of the BBS over previous data sources in producing national estimates of density and abundance at the habitat and national level. More research on the sex ratio and status of birds counted during surveys, and on the reliability of the detectability functions derived from distance sampling is needed to improve the interpretation of population estimates derived from BBS data.},

Distance sampling, which takes undetected individuals into account, is one of the most widely used methods for generating population estimates. We use this method to generate estimates of the national population size for all common and widespread non-marine breeding birds in the UK using Breeding Bird Survey data. 3. There is a strong positive relationship between our distance-sampled estimates and estimates generated using other methods. This implies that most methods get the broad picture right, even if one of them is less precise for individual species. 4. For some species, detectability may vary sufficiently between males and females to generate biases in population size estimates if these differences are not taken into account. We found a slight tendency for population estimates from distance sampling to be lower than existing estimates for species with marked sex biases in detectability. This may be a wider problem than is currently acknowledged in distance sampling. 5. Distance sampling provides a method for estimating total population size. Other bird population survey methods, such as intensive territory mapping, aim to count the number of breeding pairs, and thus exclude non-breeding individuals. Not surprisingly, we found that distance-sampled estimates tended to be higher for species with a large proportion of non-breeders. Both approaches are valid, but when calculating, reporting and using population estimates attention needs to be paid to which variable is of most interest. 6. The new estimates that we present are significantly larger than existing ones for species whose preferred habitat types were not previously well surveyed. This highlights the importance of sampling across all main habitat types. 7. Synthesis and applications. This study reviews alternative methods used for producing estimates of population size for common and widespread breeding birds in the UK.

Wildlife professionals have appropriately borrowed and assimilated many methods developed primarily in other disciplines but have also led the development of one class of quantitative methods, those that confront and incorporate uncertainty. Uncertainty arises in counts of focal entities, for which wildlife professionals have developed effective methods to deal with the common problems of nondetection and misclassification. These methods have been borrowed by disciplines as varied as paleobiology, medicine, human epidemiology, industrial quality control, military target acquisition, remote sensing, and human census. Uncertainty also arises in the modeling of those counts, specifically the observation and ecological processes that generated them. Wildlife professionals recognized the fundamental importance of model selection and rapidly assimilated methods for selecting the most appropriate model for a given data set. These methods for dealing with uncertainty inherent to counting and modeling are critical to the conduct of science and management. Wildlife professionals have developed additional methods for incorporating uncertainty in the accumulation of knowledge and the development of optimal decisions in an environment of learning. In some cases, professionals in other disciplines are using methods developed and popularized in the wildlife profession, but there is much potential for greater use.

  abstract = {Although point counts are frequently used in ornithological studies, basic assumptions about detection probabilities often are untested. We apply a double-observer approach developed to estimate detection probabilities for aerial surveys (Cook and Jacobson 1979) to avian point counts. At each point count, a designated ‘‘primary’’ observer indicates to another (‘‘secondary’’) observer all birds detected. The secondary observer records all detections of the primary observer as well as any birds not detected by the primary observer. Observers alternate primary and secondary roles during the course of the survey. The approach permits estimation of observer-specific detection probabilities and bird abundance. We developed a set of models that incorporate different assumptions about sources of variation (e.g. observer, bird species) in detection probability. Seventeen field trials were conducted, and models were fit to the resulting data using program SURVIV. Single-observer point counts generally miss varying proportions of the birds actually present, and observer and bird species were found to be relevant sources of variation in detection probabilities. Overall detection probabilities (probability of being detected by at least one of the two observers) estimated using the double-observer approach were very high (Ͼ0.95), yielding precise estimates of avian abundance. We consider problems with the approach and recommend possible solutions, including restriction of the approach to fixed-radius counts to reduce the effect of variation in the effective radius of detection among various observers and to provide a basis for using spatial sampling to estimate bird abundance on large areas of interest. We believe that most questions meriting the effort required to carry out point counts also merit serious attempts to estimate detection probabilities associated with the counts. The doubleobserver approach is a method that can be used for this purpose. Received 16 November 1998, accepted 1 October 1999.},

Our conceptual framework includes a decomposition of the probability of detecting a bird potentially exposed to sampling efforts into four separate probabilities. Primary inference methods are described and include distance sampling, multiple observers, time of detection, and repeated counts. The detection parameters estimated by these different approaches differ, leading to different interpretations of resulting estimates of density and abundance. Simultaneous use of combinations of these different inference approaches can not only lead to increased precision but also provides the ability to decompose components of the detection process. Recent efforts to test the efficacy of these different approaches using natural systems and a new bird radio test system provide sobering conclusions about the ability of observers to detect and localize birds in auditory surveys. Recent research is reported on efforts to deal with such potential sources of error as bird misclassification, measurement error, and density gradients. Methods for inference about spatial and temporal variation in avian abundance are outlined. Discussion topics include opinions about the need to estimate detection probability when drawing inference about avian abundance, methodological recommendations based on the current state of knowledge and suggestions for future research.},

  abstract = {1 Occupancy estimation and modelling based on detection–nondetection data provide an effective way of exploring change in a species’ distribution across time and space in cases where the species is not always detected with certainty. Today, many monitoring programmes target multiple species, or life stages within a species, requiring the use of multiple detection methods. When multiple methods or devices are used at the same sample sites, animals can be detected by more than one method. 2 We develop occupancy models for multiple detection methods that permit simultaneous use of data from all methods for inference about method-specific detection probabilities. Moreover, the approach permits estimation of occupancy at two spatial scales: the larger scale corresponds to species’ use of a sample unit, whereas the smaller scale corresponds to presence of the species at the local sample station or site. 3 We apply the models to data collected on two different vertebrate species: striped skunks Mephitis mephitis and red salamanders Pseudotriton ruber. For striped skunks, large-scale occupancy estimates were consistent between two sampling seasons. Small-scale occupancy probabilities were slightly lower in the late winter/spring when skunks tend to conserve energy, and movements are limited to males in search of females for breeding. There was strong evidence of method-specific detection probabilities for skunks. As anticipated, large- and small-scale occupancy areas completely overlapped for red salamanders. The analyses provided weak evidence of method-specific detection probabilities for this species. 4 Synthesis and applications. Increasingly, many studies are utilizing multiple detection methods at sampling locations. The modelling approach presented here makes efficient use of detections from multiple methods to estimate occupancy probabilities at two spatial scales and to compare detection probabilities associated with different detection methods. The models can be viewed as another variation of Pollock's robust design and may be applicable to a wide variety of scenarios where species occur in an area but are not always near the sampled locations. The estimation approach is likely to be especially useful in multispecies conservation programmes by providing efficient estimates using multiple detection devices and by providing device-specific detection probability estimates for use in survey design.},

  abstract = {Ordered distance sampling is a point-to-object sampling method that can be labor-efficient for demanding field situations. An extensive simulation study was conducted to find the optimum number, g, of population members to be encountered from each random starting point in ordered distance sampling. Monte Carlo simulations covered 64 combinations of four spatial patterns, four densities and four sample sizes. Values of g from 1 to 10 were considered for each case. Relative root mean squared error (RRMSE) and relative bias were calculated for each level of g, with RRMSE used as the primary assessment criterion for finding the optimum level of g. A nonparametric confidence interval was derived for the density estimate, and this was included in the simulations to gauge its performance.},

  abstract = {The millions of wetlands that define the Prairie Pothole Region (PPR) harbor large proportions of continental populations of several species of North American waterfowl, waterbirds, and shorebirds. The PPR also has some of the highest wind energy potential in the United States. Thousands of wind turbines are being erected in the PPR to produce electricity and have the potential to affect migratory bird populations through collisions, displacement, barriers to movement, habitat fragmentation, and habitat loss. We assessed occurrence of waterbirds and shorebirds from 2008 through 2010 on wetlands in two wind energy development sites, defined as wetlands within 805 m of a wind turbine, and two reference sites in the PPR of North and South Dakota. We conducted 10,321 wetland visits on 3,542 individual wetland basins and related bird occurrence to wetland characteristics, upland characteristics, survey type (roadside vs. off-road), seasonal timing of sampling, year of sampling, and site type (wind energy development vs. reference). Models characterizing occurrence of Willet (Catoptrophorus semipalmatus), Marbled Godwit (Limosa fedoa), Wilson's Phalarope (Phalaropus tricolor) and Black Tern (Chlidonias niger) indicated that occurrence varied with wetland characteristics and among sites and years, was not substantially reduced on either wind energy site, but was slightly and consistently lower on one of the wind energy sites for the three shorebird species. Our results suggest that wetlands have conservation value for these species when wind turbines are present, but additional sampling across time and space will be necessary to understand the effects of wind turbines on shorebird and waterbird presence, density, survival, and reproductive success.

Deriving rich coastal morphology and shore zone classification from LIDAR terrain models. Comprehensive mapping of shore-zone morphology supports evaluation of shore habitat, monitoring of environmental hazards, and characterization of the transfer of nutrients between marine and terrestrial environments. This article shows how rich shore-zone morphological metrics can be derived from LIDAR terrain models and evaluates the application of LIDAR to classify shore-zone substrates. The utility of LIDAR methods was tested in comparison with the current best-practice method of photo interpretation (i.e. the BC ShoreZone system) on Calvert Island, British Columbia, Canada. Wider applications are considered. Indicators of shore-zone morphology (i.e. slope, width, roughness, backshore elevation) were calculated from LIDAR terrain models for regularly spaced transects perpendicular to the coastline. A combination of boosted regression-tree modeling and direct-rule application was used to classify the shore-zone morphology according to the British Columbia (BC) ShoreZone system. Classification accuracy was assessed against existing ShoreZone classification data. Shore-zone substrate was classified from LIDAR-derived morphometric indicators with 90\% accuracy (five classes). A full classification, which combined substrate with shore width and slope, results in lower correspondence (40\%; 25 classes) when compared with ShoreZone classes. Differences can likely be attributed, in part, to variation in spatial resolution of elevation-based methods and photo interpretation. It is concluded that LIDAR data can be used to support characterization of shore-zone morphology. Differences in processing and interpretation cause a low direct correspondence with the current image-based classification system, but LIDAR has the advantage of higher resolution, rich terrain information, speed, and an objective and repeatable method for monitoring future change in coastal environments.},

  abstract = {Site productivity, as affected by soil nutrients and available moisture is often characterized using an edatopic grid. A challenge for forest ecologists and managers working across large areas and in complex landscapes is the need to identify spatially different ecological environments that follow an edatopic classification. Recent advances in remote sensing offer some potential approaches for mapping ecological environments and landscape conditions. It is now feasible to compile long temporal image sequences using Landsat imagery for reconstruction of forest stands and derivation of long term indices of landscape productivity; and the increasing proliferation of airborne laser scanning (ALS) technology also allows for the acquisition of detailed information on topographic elevation and vegetation structure with sub-meter accuracy. In a large area of boreal mixedwood forest in northwestern Alberta, Canada, we examined the utility of using Landsat-derived vegetation greenness (indicating productivity), and ALS-derived cartographic depth-to-water (indicating moisture), to determine forest cover type and vegetation responses following variable retention harvesting. Our results demonstrate that both long-term image sequences from Landsat and ALS-derived topography and vegetation structure act as proxies for edatopic grid components, and are well-suited to differentiating forest cover types. Deciduous-dominated, deciduousdominated with conifer understory, mixed, and conifer-dominated forests were generally distributed (in order) across a gradient of increasing moisture and decreasing greenness. Landscape greenness was the strongest predictor of vegetation regrowth after disturbance, followed by depth to water and other terrain factors, such as elevation and slope. New advances in, and complementary use of, different remotely sensed information provides a better understanding of both the landscape-scale distribution of forest cover types and patterns of vegetation regrowth following disturbance.},

  abstract = {Fire influences the distribution of fauna in terrestrial biomes throughout the world. Use of fire to achieve a mosaic of vegetation in different stages of succession after burning (i.e., patch-mosaic burning) is a dominant conservation practice in many regions. Despite this, knowledge of how the spatial attributes of vegetation mosaics created by fire affect fauna is extremely scarce, and it is unclear what kind of mosaic land managers should aim to achieve. We selected 28 landscapes (each 12.6 km2) that varied in the spatial extent and diversity of vegetation succession after fire in a 104,000 km2 area in the semiarid region of southeastern Australia. We surveyed for reptiles at 280 sites nested within the 28 landscapes. The landscape-level occurrence of 9 of the 22 species modeled was associated with the spatial extent of vegetation age classes created by fire. Biogeographic context and the extent of a vegetation type influenced 7 and 4 species, respectively. No species were associated with the diversity of vegetation ages within a landscape. Negative relations between reptile occurrence and both extent of recently burned vegetation (≤10 years postfire, n = 6) and long unburned vegetation ({$>$}35 years postfire, n = 4) suggested that a coarse-grained mosaic of areas (e.g. {$>$}1000 ha) of midsuccessional vegetation (11–35 years postfire) may support the fire-sensitive reptile species we modeled. This age class coincides with a peak in spinifex cover, a keystone structure for reptiles in semiarid and arid Australia. Maintaining over the long term a coarse-grained mosaic of large areas of midsuccessional vegetation in mallee ecosystems will need to be balanced against the short-term negative effects of large fires on many reptile species and a documented preference by species from other taxonomic groups, particularly birds, for older vegetation.},

  abstract = {Annual counts of migrating raptors at fixed observation points are a widespread practice, and changes in numbers counted over time, adjusted for survey effort, are commonly used as indices of trends in population size. Unmodeled year-to-year variation in detectability may introduce bias, reduce precision of trend estimates, and reduce power to detect trends. We conducted dependent double-observer surveys at the annual fall raptor migration count at Lucky Peak, Idaho, in 2009 and 2010 and applied Huggins closed-capture removal models and information-theoretic model selection to determine the relative importance of factors affecting detectability. The most parsimonious model included effects of observer team identity, distance, species, and day of the season. We then simulated 30 years of counts with heterogeneous individual detectability, a population decline (lambda = 0.964), and unexplained random variation in the number of available birds. Imperfect detectability did not bias trend estimation, and increased the time required to achieve 80\% power by less than 11\%. Results suggested that availability is a greater source of variance in annual counts than detectability; thus, efforts to account for availability would improve the monitoring value of migration counts. According to our models, long-term trends in observer efficiency or migratory flight distance may introduce substantial bias to trend estimates. Estimating detectability with a novel count protocol like our double-observer method is just one potential means of controlling such effects. The traditional approach of modeling the effects of covariates and adjusting the index may also be effective if ancillary data is collected consistently.},

  abstract = {Estimates of abundance of threatened and endangered species are crucial for monitoring population status and recovery progress. For most wildlife species, multiple abundance estimation methods are available and the choice of method should depend on cost and efficacy. We fieldtested the cost and efficacy of line transect, total count, sample count, and double observer methods for estimating abundance of gopher tortoise (Gopherus polyphemus) burrows in two habitats that differed in vegetation density (sparse and dense) at the Ordway-Swisher Biological Station in northcentral Florida. In the dense vegetation stratum, density of burrows estimated using the line transect method (8.58 ± 0.94 burrows ha−1) was lower than that obtained from the total count method (11.33 burrows ha−1). In the sparse vegetation stratum, estimated burrow density using the line transect method (11.32 ± 1.19 burrows ha−1) was closer to the burrow density obtained from the total count method (13.00 burrows ha−1). Density of burrows estimated using the double observer method was identical to that obtained from the total count method in dense vegetation stratum, but slightly greater than that obtained from the total count method in sparse vegetation stratum. Density of burrows estimated using the sample count method varied widely depending on the proportion of plots sampled. The cost of sampling as well as estimates of burrow density varied with habitat type. The line transect method was the least costly of the methods, and we were able to sample a larger effective area with the same effort. Using burrow cameras and patch occupancy modeling approach, we also estimated the probability of burrow occupancy by gopher tortoises (active: 0.50 ± 0.09; inactive: 0.04 ± 0.04), and used these values to estimate abundance of gopher tortoises. Using estimates of burrow abundance based on the line transect method, density of gopher tortoises was 2.75 ± 0.74 ha−1 in the sparse vegetation stratum. We recommend that gopher tortoise monitoring programs use rigorous methods for estimating burrow abundance (e.g., line transect methods) and the probability of burrow occupancy by gopher tortoises (e.g., patch occupancy modeling approach).},

  abstract = {The continued degradation of forest habitats and isolation of fragmented populations means that the conservation of endemic marmosets in the Brazilian Atlantic forest depends on human interventions including legal protection. Population monitoring is required to ensure effective management and appropriate allocation of conservation resources; however, deriving estimates of population metrics such as density within heterogeneous environments is challenging. We aimed to quantify the population density and spatial distribution of buffy-tufted-ear marmosets (Callithrix aurita) in the northern region of Serra-do-Mar State Park. We incorporated habitat suitability as quantified by a niche modeling algorithm (MAXENT) to refine density estimates obtained via distance methods. We used 6 environmental predictors to model the distribution of Callithrix aurita and used the resulting MAXENT niche model to identify environmental conditions that represent suitable habitat for this species. We used 877.7 km of line transect surveys and distance methods to derive estimates of 2.19 groups or 7.55 individuals/km2 from direct observations (n = 40), providing an overall population estimate of 1892 (95\% CI = 1155–3068) individuals in 250.7 km2 of Atlantic forest. Our refined density estimate, obtained by combining distance methods and a niche model, yielded a result of 1386 individuals. Suitable habitat was not uniformly distributed across the study area and was most strongly associated with altitude and the type of vegetation cover. We provide a review of previous surveys and find this is the largest known population of Callithrix aurita. Our refinement of density estimates provides a simple and informative addition to the primatologist’s toolbox.},

  abstract = {Enlightened forest management requires reliable information on the status and condition of each forest - interpreted from a broad context - and of change in forest conditions over time. The process of forest planning must begin with a clear statement of goals, from which detailed objectives and management plans follow. Goals and objectives for forest management should reflect the conservation value of a forest relative to other forests of the same general type. This paper reviews some recent assessments (with emphasis on North America), presents a framework for forest assessment and monitoring, and suggests some indicators of biodiversity in forests. Among the broad assessments of forest status and conservation value are a global `forest frontiers' assessment by the World Resources Institute, gap analysis projects that assess the level of representation of forests and other communities in protected areas, and ecoregion-based conservation assessments conducted by the World Wildlife Fund. Also important is information on change in forest area and condition over time. Among the common changes in forests over the past two centuries are loss of old forests, simplification of forest structure, decreasing size of forest patches, increasing isolation of patches, disruption of natural fire regimes, and increased road building, all of which have had negative effects on native biodiversity. These trends can be reversed, or at least slowed, through better management. Progress toward forest recovery can be measured through the use of ecological indicators that correspond to the specific conditions and trends of concern. Although there is a wealth of indicators to choose from, most have been poorly tested and require rigorous validation in order to be interpreted with confidence. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

  abstract = {Abstract:  Biodiversity is presently a minor consideration in environmental policy. It has been regarded as too broad and vague a concept to be applied to real-world regulatory and management problems. This problem can be corrected if biodiversity is recognized as an end in itself, and if measurable indicators can be selected to assess the status of biodiversity over time. Biodiversity, as presently understood, encompasses multiple levels of biological organization. In this paper, I expand the three primary attributes of biodiversity recognized by Jerry Franklin — composition, structure, and function—into a nested hierarchy that incorporates elements of each attribute at four levels of organization: regional landscape, community-ecosystem, population-species, and genetic. Indicators of each attribute in terrestrial ecosystems, at the four levels of organization, are identified for environmental monitoring purposes. Projects to monitor biodiversity will benefit from a direct linkage to long-term ecological research and a commitment to test hypotheses relevant to biodiversity conservation. A general guideline is to proceed from the top down, beginning with a coarse-scale inventory of landscape pattern, vegetation, habitat structure, and species distributions, then overlaying data on stress levels to identify biologically significant areas at high risk of impoverishment. Intensive research and monitoring can be directed to high-risk ecosystems and elements of biodiversity, while less intensive monitoring is directed to the total landscape (or samples thereof). In any monitoring program, particular attention should be paid to specifying the questions that monitoring is intended to answer and validating the relationships between indicators and the components of biodiversity they represent.},

  abstract = {Long-term monitoring of biodiversity in protected areas (PAs) is critical to assess threats, link conservation action to species outcomes, and facilitate improved management. Yet, rigorous longitudinal monitoring within PAs is rare. In Southeast Asia (SEA), there is a paucity of long-term wildlife monitoring within PAs, and many threatened species lack population estimates from anywhere in their range, making global assessments difficult. Here, we present new abundance estimates and population trends for 11 species between 2010 and 2020, and spatial distributions for 7 species, based on long-term line transect distance sampling surveys in Keo Seima Wildlife Sanctuary in Cambodia. These represent the first robust population estimates for four threatened species from anywhere in their range and are among the first long-term wildlife population trend analyses from the entire SEA region. Our study revealed that arboreal primates and green peafowl (Pavo muticus) generally had either stable or increasing population trends, whereas ungulates and semiarboreal primates generally had declining trends. These results suggest that ground-based threats, such as snares and domestic dogs, are having serious negative effects on terrestrial species. These findings have important conservation implications for PAs across SEA that face similar threats yet lack reliable monitoring data.},

  abstract = {Bushmeat management policies are often developed outside the communities in which they are to be implemented. These policies are also routinely designed to be applied uniformly across communities with little regard for variation in social or ecological conditions. We used fuzzy-logic cognitive mapping, a form of participatory modeling, to compare the assumptions driving externally generated bushmeat management policies with perceptions of bushmeat trade dynamics collected from local community members who admitted to being recently engaged in bushmeat trading (e.g., hunters, sellers, consumers). Data were collected during 9 workshops in 4 Tanzanian villages bordering Serengeti National Park. Specifically, we evaluated 9 community-generated models for the presence of the central factors that comprise and drive the bushmeat trade and whether or not models included the same core concepts, relationships, and logical chains of reasoning on which bushmeat conservation policies are commonly based. Across local communities, there was agreement about the most central factors important to understanding the bushmeat trade (e.g., animal recruitment, low income, and scarcity of food crops). These matched policy assumptions. However, the factors perceived to drive social-ecological bushmeat trade dynamics were more diverse and varied considerably across communities (e.g., presence or absence of collaborative law enforcement, increasing human population, market demand, cultural preference). Sensitive conservation issues, such as the bushmeat trade, that require cooperation between communities and outside conservation organizations can benefit from participatory modeling approaches that make local-scale dynamics and conservation policy assumptions explicit. Further, communities' and conservation organizations' perceptions need to be aligned. This can improve success by allowing context appropriate policies to be developed, monitored, and appropriately adapted as new evidence is generated.},

Much of the world now consists of a matrix of natural forests, managed forests, agricultural cropland, and urbanized plots. Expansion of domestic energy production efforts in the United States is one driver predicted to influence future land-use and land management practices across large spatial scales. Favorable growing conditions make the southeastern United States an ideal location for producing a large portion of the country's renewable bioenergy. We investigated patterns of bat occurrence in two bioenergy feedstocks commonly grown in this region (corn, Zea mays, and pine, Pinus taeda and P. elliottii). We also evaluated potential impacts of the three major pathways of woody biomass extraction (residue removal following clearcut harvest, short-rotation energy plantations, and mid-rotation forest thinning) to bat occurrence through a priori land-use contrasts. We acoustically sampled bat vocalizations at 84 sites in the Southeastern Plains and Southern Coastal Plains of the southeastern United States across three years. We found that mid-rotation thinning resulted in positive effects on bat occurrence, and potential conversion of unmanaged (reference) forest to managed forest for timber and/or bioenergy harvest resulted in negative effects on bat occurrence when effects were averaged across all species. The effects of short-rotation energy plantations, removal of logging residues from plantation clearcuts, and corn were equivocal for all bat species examined. Our results suggest that accelerated production of biomass for energy production through either corn or intensively managed pine forests is not likely to have an adverse effect on bat communities, so long as existing older unmanaged forests are not converted to managed bioenergy or timber plantations. Beyond bioenergy crop production, mid-rotation thinning of even-aged pine stands intended for timber production, increases to the duration of plantation rotations to promote older forest stands, arranging forest stands and crop fields to maximize edge habitat, and maintaining unmanaged forests could benefit bat communities by augmenting roosting and foraging opportunities.},

In the Gulf of Maine, one of the fastest-warming marine regions on Earth, rapid warming has caused prey-related changes in the distribution of the critically endangered North Atlantic right whale (Eubalaena glacialis). Concurrently, right whales have returned to historically important areas such as southern New England shelf waters, an area known to have been a whaling ground. We compared aerial survey data from two time periods (2013–2015; 2017–2019) to assess trends in right whale abundance in the region during winter and spring. Using distance sampling techniques, we chose a hazard rate key function to model right whale detections and used seasonal encounter rates to estimate abundance. The mean log of abundance increased by 1.40 annually between 2013 and 2019 (p\,=\,0.004), and the mean number of individuals detected per year increased by 2.23 annually between 2013 and 2019 (R2\,=\,0.69, p\,=\,0.001). These results demonstrate the current importance of this habitat and suggest that management options must continually evolve as right whales repatriate historical habitats and potentially expand to new habitats as they adapt to climate change.},

Despite being the focus of numerous studies, we still know little about the size of the range-wide breeding population and how density varies across the spectrum of juniper co-dominated woodlands. Models that have been tested and shown to be accurate are needed to help develop management and conservation guidelines. We evaluated the accuracy and bias of density estimates from binomial mixture models, the dependent double-observer method, and distance sampling by comparing them to actual densities determined by intensive territory monitoring on plots in the Balcones Canyonlands Preserve, Austin, Texas. We found that the binomial mixture models consistently overestimated density by 1.1-3.2 times (actual density = 0.07-0.46 males/ha), and the other two models overestimated by 1.1-29.8 times at low density and underestimated by 0.5-0.9 times at high density plots (actual density = 0.01-0.46 males/ha). The magnitude of error for all models was greatest at sites with few or no birds (¡0.15 males/ha), with model performance improving as actual density increased. These non-linear relationships indicate a lack of sensitivity with respect to true changes in density. Until systematic evaluation demonstrates that models such as those we tested provide accurate and unbiased density estimates for a given species over space and time, we recommend additional field tests to validate model-based estimates. Continued model validation and refinement of point-count methods are needed until accurate estimates are obtained across the density spectrum for Golden-cheeked Warblers and other songbird species.},

  abstract = {In the last few years there has been a marked growth of interest in the recent history of climate. The evidence of secular variations in climatic parameters during the last few centuries has implications for ecologists studying forests containing long-lived species. Such species record aspects of past climate in their annual growth-rings and in their population structures. The study of annual growth rings in Australian trees is still in its infancy. The concepts and techniques of dendrochronology and its sub-fields dendroecology and dendroclimatology are outlined. A species by species account of dendrochronological studies employing Australian trees is presented. As most of the results are unpublished, the treatment is selective and intended to illustrate the potential of, or progress with, a particular tree species. The greatest potential for dendrochronology in Australia lies with the endemic Tasmanian conifers in the genera Athrotaxis, Dacrydium and Phyllocladus. Not only do these contain very long lived individuals (e.g. {$>$}2000yr, Dacrydium frankliniU but also they have the most suitable ring characteristics. Chronologies of about 1000 y rand 780 yr are being prepared for A. cupressoides and Phyllocladus aspleniifolius respectively. There is good regional cross-dating within species, and to a lesser extent between species, giving promise of a detailed reconstruction of past climate for Tasmania.},

  abstract = {Effective management and conservation of wildlife populations require reliable estimates of population size, which can be difficult and costly to obtain. We evaluated how precision in estimates of herd size and abundance varies with sample size and strip width using two field surveys and bootstrap resampling of the field data. We also examined precision under distance sampling and evaluated the cost-effectiveness of both survey techniques. Precision in estimates of abundance increased with increasing sample size and varied with strip width independently of sample size. The hazard rate key function was best for five species in two surveys with contrasting visibility conditions. Precision in density was more sensitive to the number of herds sighted than to variation in herd size and effective strip width for distance sampling. Strip counts produced lower abundance estimates but higher precision than distance sampling. We estimated that distance sampling would cost about US\$3.1 km(-1) of transect. Strip counts deserve serious consideration for surveys of species that occur at high densities and form large, loose agglomerations but distance methods are suitable for species occurring at moderate to low densities in areas where visibility varies substantially. Distance sampling may thus need to be supplemented by strip counts to efficiently estimate densities of rare, abundant and highly clustered multi-species assemblages of African savanna mammals. In small areas, it may often prove necessary to conduct several surveys to obtain adequate sample sizes for distance models.},

  abstract = {Management often bases decisions on estimates of animal density and population size. Aerial sampling is expensive whilst current ground methods, noticeably Distance sampling, assume a single detection function for each habitat and that visibility in a given habitat type declines in a smooth, increasing manner with distance from the observer. If the visibility within a habitat varies widely or is suddenly cut off, as amongst abrupt topography, these assumptions are invalidated. We present an affordable, accessible and accurate method for conducting repeated annual censuses on large herbivores in such terrain. We used a GIS habitat-based approach. Monthly, over a two year period, we conducted repeated road transects in Ithala Game Reserve, South Africa, using GPS to record the geographic position of each sighting. These records (n=8742) were then imported into a GIS and overlaid onto an existing habitat-type GIS layer. With the sampled area thus defined as an irregular polygon in the GIS encompassing all records, we calculated densities of each herbivore species by habitat type and extrapolated total population size estimates. Estimates of maximum population size for wildebeest and zebra correlated (+/- 15\%) with management's estimates based on aerial surveys, walked transects and experience. White rhino are individually counted in the reserve and our estimates (year 1: 52; year 2: 57) matched these known numbers (year 1: 50; year 2: 53). Our method also yielded realistic numbers for impala, but unrealistic numbers for kudu and warthog. Our GIS-based census technique produced realistic maximum population estimates for abundant grazing and mixed-feeder mesoherbivores and for scarce, but highly visible, megaherbivores, but not for cryptic species. With the increasing availability of GIS data, the technique is recommended to those working in abrupt terrain frustrated by the inability of current ground census techniques, principally Distance sampling, to produce realistic population estimates.},

  abstract = {Hunting with wire snares is rife within many tropical forest systems, and constitutes one of the severest threats to a wide range of vertebrate taxa. As for all threats, reliable monitoring of snaring levels is critical for assessing the relative effectiveness of management interventions. However, snares pose a particular challenge in terms of tracking spatial or temporal trends in their prevalence because they are extremely difficult to detect, and are typically spread across large, inaccessible areas. As with cryptic animal targets, any approach used to monitor snaring levels must address the issue of imperfect detection, but no standard method exists to do so. We carried out a field experiment in Keo Seima Wildlife Reserve in eastern Cambodia with the following objectives: (1) To estimate the detection probably of wire snares within a tropical forest context, and to investigate how detectability might be affected by habitat type, snare type, or observer. (2) To trial two sets of sampling protocols feasible to implement in a range of challenging field conditions. (3) To conduct a preliminary assessment of two potential analytical approaches to dealing with the resulting snare encounter data. We found that although different observers had no discernible effect on detection probability, detectability did vary between habitat type and snare type. We contend that simple repeated counts carried out at multiple sites and analyzed using binomial mixture models could represent a practical yet robust solution to the problem of monitoring snaring levels both inside and outside of protected areas. This experiment represents an important first step in developing improved methods of threat monitoring, and such methods are greatly needed in southeast Asia, as well as in as many other regions.},

Quantitative estimates of gazelle numbers are essential for understanding the causes of changes in the population, and thus devising conservation strategies to assure its long-term viability. Observed herds ranged in size from 1-4,000; among surveys, median herd sizes varied from 14-42. Density estimates varied from 10.7 gazelles km(-2) in spring to 11.5 gazelles km(-2) in autumn, with total population estimates of 803,820 (483,790-1,330,100 95\%, confidence interval) and 870,625 (499,432-1,491,278 95\% confidence interval), respectively. Confidence limits were wide, and to obtain a coefficient of variation of 20\%, transect lengths would need to be extended three- to four-fold.

Our estimates were similar to or lower than those from other studies in similar locations in previous years; thus, we recommend continued monitoring to determine trends in nesting pair density over time. Additionally, we performed double-observer surveys on a subset of transects with a helicopter as the second observation aircraft. We estimated probability of detecting occupied nests from fixed-wing plane versus helicopter, as well as time and expense of each survey mode. Although observers surveying from helicopters were 1.19 and 1.12 times more likely to detect Ferruginous Hawk and Golden Eagle occupied nests, respectively, the helicopter survey was 4.55 times costlier due to longer flight time and the higher hourly costs. Thus, when systematically surveying large areas, we found cost and time of the helicopter surveys outweighed the increase in nest detection.},

  abstract = {The use of hydroacoustics is currently being studied and developed as a promising non-intrusive methodology to monitor and manage fish stocks in aquaculture farms. The main objective of this study was to develop an acoustic method for the estimation of fish density and biomass in inland aquaculture farms and test the accuracy and precision of the estimates with real data provided by the company. The study was conducted in sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax) production ponds located in Seville (Southern Spain). A Simrad EK60 echosounder with two split-beam circular transducers operating simultaneously at 200 kHz was used for hydroacoustic surveys. Two different hydroacoustic designs were considered: central trajectories and zigzag trajectories. The accuracy and precision of the estimates were examined in order to select the best sampling design. Due to a nonhomogeneous fish distribution in the pond caused by the avoidance behaviour, as a response to the sampling disturbance presented by fish, acoustic density and biomass were corrected by applying sampling theory according to the probability of fish detection. When density and biomass were corrected, the estimates became highly accurate and precise with respect to real data, which confirms that the proposed method is adequate. Similarly, acoustic estimates of fish weight were highly in agreement with real data, due to the use of specific equations developed “in situ” for the study. Although no significant differences were recorded in the density and biomass estimates with regard to the trajectory used (central vs. zigzag), it was observed that the most accurate agreement and precision were always obtained in central trajectories. Therefore, central design is proposed as the most appropriate design for hydroacoustic measurements in inland ponds. The results obtained in this study provide estimates of density and biomass that accurately match the real data, supporting the use of hydroacoustics as a potentially valid tool to manage inland aquaculture farms.},

Based on small-scale freshwater aquaculture farms in western Kenya, field surveys were conducted during three sampling seasons spread across 6 months. These involved the following: (1) a sociological survey of 29 fish farming households; (2) sampling of amphibians for density, species richness and encounter rates and (3) measuring grass height, pond dimensions and water-source proximity across 24 ponds. Overall, 131 individual frogs from three families were recorded in 78 encounters. Amphibian density increased with pond-side grass height, presumably increasing predation risk, but decreased with water-source proximity. Amphibian encounter rate also decreased with water-source proximity, but was unaffected by grass height, while species richness responded positively to pond-side grass height, but not to water-source proximity. Amphibian encounter likelihood was higher in tilapia-only than in catfish-only or tilapia and catfish ponds irrespective of habitat variables. We demonstrate here that management practices for mitigating fish loss to predatory amphibians should include trimming pond-side vegetation, siting ponds close-to-moderate distances from water-sources and including catfish in pond polycultures.},

To test this assumption, we conducted independent double-observer pair surveys in North Dakota, USA, to evaluate sources of variation in detection probabilities for 8 common species of prairie-nesting ducks. An experienced observer had 0.911 detection probability averaged over all 8 species (range 0.866-0.944) versus 0.790 (range 0.537-0.890) for a novice observer. Detection probabilities also varied substantially among species, but patterns were not consistent between observers. Detection probabilities declined as number of ducks per wetland increased, presumably due to difficulty in identifying large numbers of flushing ducks. Other covariates affecting detection probabilities included size of social groups, precipitation, survey methodology (roadside vs. walk-up), cloud cover, time of day, and amount of wetland vegetation, but these covariates only affected detection probabilities by 2-5\%. Our results demonstrated that the assumption of 100\% detection probabilities for ground-based waterfowl counts was clearly false and surveys based on this erroneous assumption underestimated population size by 10-29\%. We recommend that future investigators measure detection probabilities explicitly by using double-observer methodologies. (JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT 73(3): 392398; 2009)},

We conducted 3 sequential counts of 1,357 waterfowl broods in northeastern North Dakota, USA, and used closed-population mark-recapture models to estimate total brood abundance while controlling for variation in detection probabilities (p). Blue-winged teal (Anas discors) broods had the lowest average detection probability (p = 0.305), whereas diving-duck broods had the highest average detectability (p = 0.571). Detection was generally highest in morning or evening, but temporal patterns varied among species and there was no survey window that maximized detection probabilities for all species. Detection probabilities averaged 0.108 (SD = 0.056) higher for an experienced observer versus an inexperienced observer. Detection probabilities were 0.044 higher for roadside versus walk-up surveys and increased with increasing brood size, total brood abundance, survey date, wind speed, temperature, cloud cover, and amount of time spent surveying each wetland. Detection probabilities declined with increasing wetland size and amount of tall peripheral vegetation. Our mark-recapture results indicated that a traditional unreplicated brood survey would have missed 67.5\% of estimated broods, summed over all species. Use of closed-population mark-recapture techniques provided an effective method for reducing this bias and identifying and quantifying factors that reduce detection probabilities of waterfowl broods. We recommend that future brood surveys incorporate 2 or 3 temporally segregated replicate counts to allow for formal estimation of detection probabilities.

  abstract = {Validating biodiversity indicators requires an analysis of their applicability, their range of validity and their degree of correlation with the biodiversity they are supposed to represent. In this process, assessing the magnitude of observer effect is an essential step, especially if non-specialist observers are involved. Tree microhabitats woodpecker cavities, cracks and bark characteristics are reputed to be easily detected by non-specialists as microhabitat observation does not require prior forestry or ecology knowledge. We therefore quantified the probabilities of true and false positive detections made by observers during inventories. Within two 0.5 ha plots in a forest reserve that has not been harvested for at least 150 years, 14 observers with various backgrounds visually inventoried microhabitats on 106 oak (Quercus petraea and Quercus robur) and beech (Fagus sylvatica) trees. We used parametric and Bayesian statistics to compare these observers' recorded observations with results from an independent census. The mean number of microhabitats per tree varied widely among observers from 1.4 to over 3. Only five observers reported a mean number of microhabitats per tree that was statistically equivalent to the reference census. The probability of true detection also varied among observers for each microhabitat (from to 0 to 1) as did the probability of false positive detection (from 0 to 0.7). These results show that microhabitat inventories are particularly prone to observer effects. Such strong observer effects weaken the usefulness of microhabitats as biodiversity indicators. If microhabitat inventories are to be developed, we recommend controlling for observer effects by (i) defining standard operating procedures and multiplying the number of observer training sessions and of consensual standardization censuses; (ii) using pairs of observers to record microhabitats whenever possible (though the efficiency of this method remains to be tested); (iii) planning fieldwork so that the factors of interest are not confused with observer effects; and (iv) integrating observer profiles into the statistical models used to analyze the data.

Nonetheless, a series of systematic multispecies aerial surveys was carried out in the seas around Italy to gather important baseline information on cetacean occurrence, distribution and abundance. The monitored areas included the Pelagos Sanctuary, the Tyrrhenian Sea, portions of the Seas of Corsica and Sardinia, the Ionian Seas as well as the Gulf of Taranto. Overall, approximately 48,000 km were flown in either spring, summer and winter between 2009-2014, covering an area of 444,621 km(2). The most commonly observed species were the striped dolphin and the fin whale, with 975 and 83 recorded sightings, respectively. Other sighted cetacean species were the common bottlenose dolphin, the Risso's dolphin, the sperm whale, the pilot whale and the Cuvier's beaked whale. Uncorrected model-and design-based estimates of density and abundance for striped dolphins and fin whales were produced, resulting in a best estimate (model-based) of around 95,000 striped dolphins (CV=11.6\%; 95\% CI=92,900-120,300) occurring in the Pelagos Sanctuary, Central Tyrrhenian and Western Seas of Corsica and Sardinia combined area in summer 2010. Estimates were also obtained for each individual study region and year. An initial attempt to estimate perception bias for striped dolphins is also provided. The preferred summer 2010 uncorrected best estimate (design-based) for the same areas for fin whales was around 665 (CV=33.1\%; 95\% CI=350-1260). Estimates are also provided for the individual study regions and years. The results represent baseline data to develop efficient, long-term, systematic monitoring programmes, essential to evaluate trends, as required by a number of national and international frameworks, and stress the need to ensure that surveys are undertaken regularly and at a sufficient spatial scale. The management implications of the results are discussed also in light of a possible decline of fin whales abundance over the period from the mid-1990s to the present. Further work to understand changes in distribution and to allow for improved spatial models is emphasized.},

  abstract = {Statistical models for estimating absolute densities of field populations of animals have been widely used over the last century in both scientific studies and wildlife management programs. To date, two general classes of density estimation models have been developed: models that use data sets from capture-recapture or removal sampling techniques (often derived from trapping grids) from which separate estimates of population size ((N) over cap) and effective sampling area ((A) over cap) are used to calculate density ((D) over cap = (N) over cap/(A) over cap); and models applicable to sampling regimes using distance-sampling theory (typically transect lines or trapping webs) to estimate detection functions and densities directly from the distance data. However, few studies have evaluated these respective models for accuracy, precision. and bias on known field populations. and no studies have been conducted that compare the two approaches under controlled field conditions. In this study, we evaluated both classes of density estimators on known densities of enclosed rodent populations. Test data sets (n = 11) were developed using nine rodent species from capture-recapture live-trapping on both trapping grids and trapping webs in four replicate 4.2-ha enclosures on the Sevilleta National Wildlife Refuge in central New Mexico, USA. Additional "saturation" trapping efforts resulted in an enumeration of the rodent populations in each enclosure, allowing the computation of true densities. Density estimates ((D) over cap) were calculated using program CAPTURE for the grid data sets and program DISTANCE for the web data sets, and these results were compared to the known true densities (D) to evaluate each model's relative mean square error, accuracy, precision, and bias. In addition, we evaluated a variety of approaches to each data set's analysis by having a group of independent expert analysts calculate their best density estimates without a priori knowledge of the true densities this "blind" test allowed us to evaluate the influence of expertise and experience in calculating density estimates in comparison to simply using default values in programs CAPTURE and DISTANCE. While the rodent sample sizes were considerably smaller than the recommended minimum for good model results, we found that several models performed well empirically. including the web-based uniform and half-normal models in program DISTANCE, and the grid-based models M-b and M-bh in program CAPTURE (with A adjusted by species-specific full mean maximum distance moved (MMDM) values). These models produced accurate (D) over cap values (with 95\% confidence intervals that included the true D values) and exhibited acceptable bias but poor precision. However. in linear regression analyses comparing each model's (D) over cap values to the true D values over the range of observed test densities, only the web-based uniform model exhibited a regression slope near 1.0; all other models showed substantial slope deviations. indicating biased estimates at higher or lower density values. In addition, the grid-based (D) over cap analyses using full MMDM values for (W) over cap area adjustments required a number of theoretical assumptions of uncertain validity, and we therefore viewed their empirical successes with caution. Finally, density estimates from the independent analysts were highly variable, but estimates from web-based approaches had smaller mean square errors and better achieved confidence-interval coverage of D than did grid-based approaches. Our results support the contention that web-based approaches for density estimation of small-mammal populations are both theoretically and empirically superior to grid-based approaches, even when sample size is far less than often recommended. In view of the increasing need for standardized environmental measures for comparisons among ecosystems and through time, analytical models based on distance sampling appear to offer accurate density estimation approaches for research studies involving small-mammal abundances.},

  abstract = {Conservation management of wildlife species should be underpinned by knowledge of their distribution and abundance, as well as impacts of human activities on their populations and habitats. Common dolphins (Delphinus delphis) are subject to incidental capture in a range of Australia’s commercial fisheries including gill netting, purse seining and mid-water trawling. The impact these fishery interactions have on common dolphin populations is uncertain, as estimates of abundance are lacking, particularly for the segments of the populations at risk of bycatch and in greater need of protection. Here we used double-observer platform aerial surveys and mark-recapture distance sampling methods to estimate the abundance of common dolphins in 2011 over an area of 42,438 km2 in central South Australia, where incidental mortality of common dolphins due to fisheries bycatch is the highest. We also used the potential biological removal (PBR) method to estimate sustainable levels of human-caused mortality for this segment of the population. The estimated abundance of common dolphins was 21,733 (CV = 0.25; 95\% CI = 13,809–34,203) in austral summer/autumn and 26,504 in winter/spring (CV = 0.19; 95\% CI = 19,488–36,046). Annual PBR estimates, assuming a conservative maximum population growth rate of Rmax = 0.02 and a recovery factor of Fr = 0.5 for species of unknown conservation status, ranged from 189 (summer/autumn) to 239 dolphins (winter/spring), and from 378 (summer/autumn) to 478 dolphins (winter/spring) with an Rmax = 0.04. Our results indicate that common dolphins are an abundant dolphin species in waters over the central South Australian continental shelf (up to 100 m deep). Based on the 2011 abundance estimates of this species, the highest estimated bycatch of common dolphins (423 mortalities in 2004/05) in the southern Australian region exceeded the precautionary PBR estimates for this population segment. Recent bycatch levels appear to be below PBR estimates, but low observer coverage and underreporting of dolphin mortalities by fishers means that estimates of dolphin bycatch rates are not robust. The effects of cumulative human impacts on common dolphins are not well understood, and thus we recommend a precautionary management approach to manage common dolphin bycatch based on local abundance estimates.},

Conventional methods for monitoring hunted forest-vertebrate species require intensive in situ survey effort, which severely constrains spatial and temporal replication. Integrating local ecological knowledge (LEK) into monitoring and management is appealing because it can be cost-effective, enhance community participation, and provide novel insights into sustainable resource use. We develop a technique to monitor population depletion of hunted forest wildlife in the Brazilian Amazon, based on the local ecological knowledge of rural hunters. We performed rapid interview surveys to estimate the landscape-scale depletion of ten large-bodied vertebrate species around 161 Amazonian riverine settlements. We assessed the explanatory and predictive power of settlement and landscape characteristics and were able to develop robust estimates of local faunal depletion. By identifying species-specific drivers of depletion and using secondary data on human population density, land form, and physical accessibility, we then estimated landscape-and regional-scale depletion. White-lipped peccary (Tayassu pecari), for example, were estimated to be absent from 17\% of their putative range in Brazil's largest state (Amazonas), despite 98\% of the original forest cover remaining intact. We found evidence that bushmeat consumption in small urban centers has far-reaching impacts on some forest species, including severe depletion well over 100 km from urban centers. We conclude that LEK-based approaches require further field validation, but have significant potential for community-based participatory monitoring as well as cost-effective, large-scale monitoring of threatened forest species.},

  abstract = {Most streams in the Upper Delaware Bay U.S.A. drainage have been impounded either historically or at present to accommodate a variety of wetland management objectives. Long-term impoundment has resulted in loss of wetland function and biodiversity. Nevertheless, extensive wetlands in Salem County, New Jersey and New Castle County, Delaware provide habitat for many important waterbirds, including breeding wading birds, migratory shorebirds, and waterfowl. Public and private agencies in both states have initiated wetland restoration programs to improve habitat values for multiple waterbird groups. I conducted wetland studies in nine streams to examine patterns of waterbird use to 1) identify water level management practices that promote waterbird utilization, and 2) develop guidelines for resource managers to meet integrated wetland management objectives. A total of 62 species (32,100 individuals) of wading birds, waterfowl, shorebirds, seabirds, marshbirds, and raptors was recorded April-July, 1993-1996 and 2000 during weekly observations. Most waterbird groups were more abundant at impounded sites than at tidal sites in streams. In addition, the use of streams within the region varied for all waterbird groups indicating that some streams were highly utilized while at others, relatively few waterbirds were present. Water level management regime vas an important factor in determining waterbird use. Wading birds were most abundant at wetlands undergoing a mid-season drawdown at which time many locally-breeding species were meeting adult and nestling food requirements. Waterfowl were more abundant at wetlands with relatively high water levels in early spring compared to levels later in the season. which coincided with duck migration. Migratory shorebirds were most abundant on wetlands with relatively low water levels during May. Results 1) confirm the need for variably-managed wetland mosaics which provide habitat at a variety of beater levels and 2) identify the importance of timing of drawdown in meeting the foraging needs of multiple waterbird groups.},

  abstract = {In wildlife communities composed of federally endangered species, there are often several species of conservation concern that have not yet warranted federally mandated protection. These species often need continued monitoring to inform the direction of future management. While recovering endangered species is an important conservation goal, practitioners are challenged by balancing federally mandated protocols with actions that promote non-listed priority species. Practitioners need an understanding of how focused, single-species management actions may affect non-listed priority species, but developing a monitoring protocol that can detect such effects with limited resources is a challenge. Here we use constrained optimization as a path to identifying a sampling scheme that overcomes these logistical challenges and then illustrate its potential in the Sandhills region of North Carolina, USA. Using empirical results from multi-year avian community monitoring, we parameterized simulations to understand how varying the number of sampling locations and site visits affected the optimal monitoring protocol across three different avian community composition scenarios: a community with (1) 10 percent, (2) 25 percent, or (3) 50 percent non-listed priority species. We found the greatest rate of change in precision of community-level metrics, such as species richness, by increasing sampling replicates when surveying up to 50 sites. Importantly, this trend was apparent across all three community scenarios, indicating relatively predictable changes in uncertainty regardless of community composition. In contrast, increasing the sampling frequency did not consistently reduce uncertainty in species-level parameters such as occupancy probability. Concerningly, we saw the greatest variation when communities were comprised of 50 percent non-listed species suggesting increasingly complex monitoring protocols may be required if the number of non-listed priority species continues to increase. Practitioners could consider reducing detection error of priority species through increasing sampling frequency, as this can strongly affect optimization study designs.},

  abstract = {Estimating population abundance for territorial species is challenging because individuals often differ in behavior (e.g., transience, multiterritoriality), and thus in detectability. How well prevailing methods detect and quantify individuals using multiple strategies is rarely addressed. In our effort to efficiently quantify avian abundance and transience among diverse nonbreeding habitats, we combined 'unmarked' (distance sampling) with traditional 'marked' (territory mapping) survey methods using a migratory passerine, the American Redstart (Setophaga ruticilla), wintering in 3 habitats in Jamaica from 2010 to 2012. We predicted that the 'unmarked' survey method would detect not only all known (marked) territorial individuals, but also individuals that were transient or nonterritorial in the same habitats. Comparisons of abundance estimates generated by our best distance sampling (unmarked) model with territory mapping data identified high proportions of transient individuals (up to 50\%) in 2 habitats, coastal dry scrub and mangrove, and virtually none in the third habitat, higher-elevation wet limestone forest. Documenting so many nonterritorial individuals, disproportionately weighted toward females and yearlings, in some habitat-year combinations prompts questions of what conditions favor transience and what role these individuals play in population processes. Our results illustrate how unmarked and marked survey methods can be used jointly to establish the number and identity of transients from neighboring areas. The unmarked survey method was sufficient for estimating population size among different habitats, but marked survey methods were necessary to identify and quantify transient individuals. Combined, these methods provide a powerful tool for assessing the range and variation of space-use strategies deployed by nonbreeding individuals.},

However, population-dynamic theory predicts that impacts of harvesting depend on the type and strength of density-dependent regulation. Here, we used logistic population growth models and an empirical reindeer case study to show that low to moderate harvesting can actually buffer populations against environmental perturbations. This occurs because of density-dependent environmental stochasticity, where negative environmental impacts on vital rates are amplified at high population density due to intra-specific resource competition. Simulations from our population models show that even low levels of harvesting may prevent overabundance, thereby dampening population fluctuations and reducing the risk of population collapse and quasi-extinction following environmental perturbations. Thus, depending on the species' life history and the strength of density-dependent environmental drivers, low to moderate harvesting can improve population resistance to increased climate variability and extreme weather expected under global warming.},

  abstract = {Despite being a widespread and important game species in Europe, scientifically reliable, easy applicable and cost effective methods for monitoring abundance of roe deer Capreolus capreolus populations do not yet exist. The currently recommended kilometric index (AI-p) captures temporal variation in the relative abundance of populations; however, because this index is carried out on foot, it is demanding in terms of sampling effort and difficult to apply at spatial scales of several hundred km(2) typical of deer management units. Here, we propose and test a modified version of the kilometric index by using a vehicle to carry out transects over large areas (AI-v). To validate this abundance index, we compared variation in population abundance estimated with AI-p and AI-v with capture-mark-recapture (CMR) estimates of population density in a roe deer population, Chize (France), monitored for 24 years (including eight years when both indices were collected). We found no detectable effect of conditions of observation (temperature and precipitation) on either AI-p or AI-v. AI-p and AI-v were both positively and linearly related (on a log scale) to CMR estimates of population density, after accounting for uncertainty of CMR estimates by using a bootstrap procedure. AI-p was slightly better correlated to population density (r = 0.76) than AI-v (r = 0.58). The positive correlation of AI-p and AI-v with CMR density estimates as well as the reduced costs of conducting surveys by car instead on foot (-47\%) suggest that diurnal vehicle counts of roe deer can provide a suitable abundance index to monitor temporal trends in roe deer populations at operational management scales. For reliable management of wildlife populations, diurnal vehicle counts of roe deer could be used in association with measures of animal performance and herbivore impacts on the habitat, within the framework of the indicators of ecological change.},

We have used data from 21 surveys of mountain ungulates in the Iberian Peninsula, France and the Italian Alps. Data from such surveys were analyzed with the program Distance 6.0. Our analyses show that estimated density can be higher for higher levels of data truncation. We also confirm that the estimates tend to be more precise when data are analyzed without binning and without truncating. We found no evidence of size biased sampling as group size and distances were uncorrelated in most of our surveys. Despite distance sampling being a fairly robust methodology, it can be sensitive to some data analysis strategies.},

We also account for the effect of partially-observed individual covariates, to account for the effect of group size on detection probability. Finally, we separate the probability of availability to detection from the probability of detection itself. We perform a thorough, illustrated assessment of the pros and cons of this framework with simulations and real case studies. First, we compare to simple linear models, illustrating the magnitude of the bias caused by imperfect detection. Second, we compare to standard distance sampling, illustrating the bias caused by variation in the probability of availability to detection. However, the availability to detection was weakly identifiable, meaning that the ability to separate it from detection probability, and therefore debias the trend estimate, depended on the data configuration. Combining distance with multiple observers and with time-to-detection solved the weak identifiability in an applied case study. We recommend using both the type of analysis we showcase, and a simple regression of the population count against time. Discrepancies between results from simple and complex analyses can help identify sources of bias in the former and loss of precision in the latter within the logistical constraints of local wildlife management schemes.},

Carcass counts conducted to quantify the take' of protected species need to be corrected for carcass persistence probability (removal by scavengers and decay) and detection probability (searcher efficiency). These probabilities may vary with time since death, because of intrinsic changes in carcass properties with age and of heterogeneity (preferential removal of easy-to-detect carcasses). 3. In this article, we describe the use of superpopulation capture-recapture models to perform the required corrections to the raw count data. We review how to make such models age specific and how to combine trial experiments with carcass searches in order to accommodate the fact that carcasses are stationary (which affects the detection process). 4. We derive information about optimal sampling design (proportion of the turbines to sample, number of sampling occasions, interval between sampling occasions) and use simulations to illustrate the expected precision of mortality estimates. We analyse data from a small wind farm in New Jersey, in which we find the estimated number of fatalities to be twice the number of carcasses found. 5. Synthesis and applications. Our approach to estimation of wind farm mortality based on data from carcass surveys is flexible and can accommodate a range of different sampling designs and biological hypotheses. Resulting mortality estimates can be used (1) to quantify the required amount of compensation actions, (2) to inform mortality projections for proposed wind development sites and (3) to inform decisions about management of existing wind farms.},

  abstract = {Population and trophic relationships among diving ducks in Chesapeake Bay are diverse and complex as they include five species of bay ducks (Aythya spp.), nine species of seaducks (Tribe Mergini), and the Ruddy Duck (Oxyura jamaicensis). Here we considered the relationships between population changes and diet over the past half century to assess the importance of prey changes to wintering waterfowl in the Bay. Food habits of 643 diving ducks collected from Chesapeake Bay during 1999-2006 were determined by analyses of their gullet (esophagus and proventriculus) and gizzard contents and compared to historical data (1885-1979) of 1,541 diving ducks. Aerial waterfowl surveys, in general, suggest that six species of seaducks were more commonly located in the meso- to polyhaline areas of the Bay, whereas five species of bay ducks and Ruddy Ducks were in the oligo- to mesohaline areas. Seaducks fed on a molluscan diet of Hooked Mussel (Ischadium recurvum), Amethyst Gemclam (Gemma gemma), and Dwarf Surfclam (Mulinia lateralis). Bay ducks and Ruddy Ducks fed more on Baltic Macoma (Macoma balthica), the adventive Atlantic Rangia (Rangia cuneata), and submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV). Mergansers were found over the widest salinity range in the Bay, probably because of their piscivorous diet. Each diving duck species appears to fill a unique foraging niche, although there is much overlap of selected prey. When current food habits are compared to historic data, only the Canvasback (Aythya valisineria) has had major diet changes, although SAV now accounts for less food volume for all diving duck species, except the Redhead (Aythya americana). Understanding the trophic-habitat relationships of diving ducks in coastal wintering areas will give managers a better understanding of the ecological effects of future environmental changes. Intensive restoration efforts on SAV and oyster beds should greatly benefit diving duck populations.},

Another concern in aerial surveys is accounting for undetected animals (i.e., visibility bias). Currently, a stratified random block-survey design (hereafter, block-surveys) is used to develop moose (Alces alces) population estimates in several regions of North America. In this case study, we evaluated the application of distance sampling as an alternative to block-surveys in Alberta, Canada. We conducted distance-sampling surveys in 2010 and 2012 and compared density estimates, precision (coeff. of variation) and flight effort (hr/100 km(2) of survey area) to block-surveys flown in 2002, 2007, 2009, and 2012. To assess sightability bias and subsequently correct for moose missed on the transect line, we developed a predictive sightability model using 41 sightability trials with 21 radiocollared moose in 2009 and 2010. Without correcting for visibility bias on the transect line, distance sampling was more efficient in terms of flight-hours than block-surveys, while providing population estimates with similar or higher precision. Estimated sightability on the transect line was 67\% in 2010 and 46\% in 2012, which was used to re-scale the detection functions. Considering that population estimates from block-surveys as applied in Alberta are based on observable moose, distance sampling with a sightability correction likely provided more accurate estimates. Our results support the application of distance sampling as an alternative to block-surveys, but we suggest further investigation of methods for correcting visibility bias on the transect line.

The influence of wood and habitat variables including water depth, velocity, and substrate on juvenile coho salmon summer relative abundance was assessed by snorkelling areas with introduced (generally 2-3 evergreen trees from the riparian zone), natural, and no wood. Juvenile coho salmon relative densities were compared at stations with introduced, natural, and no wood and their distribution (presence) assessed at natural wood stations using logistic regression. Relative densities of coho salmon were greatest at stations with introduced wood and were greater at introduced and natural wood stations than stations lacking wood, where juvenile coho salmon were generally absent. Wood cover complexity influenced juvenile coho salmon presence at natural wood stations, while wood type, wood surface area, and substrate influenced presence during one of two years. The results suggest that wood and aspects of wood cover (i.e., complexity and size) are important components of juvenile coho salmon summer rearing habitat in larger river channels, and managers should attempt to maintain and/or restore complex wood cover in relatively large river channels to provide summer habitat for juvenile coho salmon.},

  abstract = {Efficient, practical and accurate estimates of population parameters are a necessary basis for effective conservation action to meet biodiversity targets. The brown hare is representative of many European farmland species: historically widespread and abundant but having undergone rapid declines as a result of agricultural intensification. As a priority species in the UK Biodiversity Action Plan, it has national targets for population increase that are part of wider national environmental indicators. Previous research has indicated that brown hare declines have been greatest in pastural landscapes and that gains might be made by focussing conservation effort there. We therefore used hares in pastural landscapes to examine how basic changes in survey methodology can affect the precision of population density estimates and related these to national targets for biodiversity conservation in the UK. Line transects for hares carried out at night resulted in higher numbers of detections, had better-fitting detection functions and provided more robust density estimates with lower effort than those during the day, due primarily to the increased probability of detection of hares at night and the nature of hare responses to the observer. Hare spring densities varied widely within a single region, with a pooled mean of 20.6 hares km 22, significantly higher than the reported national average of hares in pastures of 3.3 hares km(-2). The high number of encounters allowed us to resolve hare densities at site, season and year scales. We demonstrate how survey conduct can impact on data quantity and quality with implications for setting and monitoring biodiversity targets. Our case study of the brown hare provides evidence that for wildlife species with low detectability, large scale volunteer-based monitoring programmes, either species specific or generalist, might be more successfully and efficiently carried out by a small number of trained personnel able to employ methods that maximise detectability.},

Nine subpopulations were surveyed in 2009 and 2010 using a distance sampling technique. Also, these data were compared to data collected in 1999 by the Gauteng Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Environment, so as to determine possible population trends. The results showed a decline of 43\% in mean population density between 1999 and 2010, suggesting that the population of Aloe peglerae in the Magaliesberg is in a state of decline.

A framework has been developed for coastal environments, combining concepts from remote sensing and landscape ecology to provide remotely sensed data users with an objective basis for selecting “optimal” data sets and processing techniques. The framework was applied to case studies in: coastal wetlands of southern California; coastal wet-dry tropical wetlands in Northern Territory, Australia; and a rapidly urbanizing coastal catchment in southeast Queensland, Australia. Results established for each case study demonstrated that the framework functioned effectively in different coastal environments and provided more accurate results than ad hoc solutions.

This study proposes a distance-based tree density estimator using Matern point processes, generating clustered spatial patterns. It was defined as the maximum likelihood estimator of the density, based on an approximate distribution of the distance from a random point to the pth nearest tree. It was compared with seven estimators identified in the literature as the most efficient. The estimators were compared on a benchmark of 10 point processes, with six being adjusted to observed tree patterns in six Mali savannas (West Africa). The proposed estimator was generally the most efficient. However, this result ignores that (i) all estimators do not require the same effort on the field, (ii) the point-processes benchmark was restricted to Matern processes, and (iii) all estimators are not equivalent with respect to measurement errors.

  abstract = {Grauer's gorillas (Gorilla beringei graueri) have declined drastically across their range in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). Survey data analysed in 2016 estimated a 77\% decline in numbers between the mid- 1990s and 2016 and predicted that Kahuzi-Biega National Park (KBNP), and the contiguous Oku Community Reserve (OCR) held much of the global population. An estimate of 3800 Grauer's gorillas was made across its range at that time. Here, we publish the most extensive survey of Grauer's gorilla numbers to date, using nest counts from 230 line transects across KBNP and OCR to derive more accurate estimates of both gorilla and chimpanzee numbers. Gorilla numbers were estimated from line transects at 1,571 (95\% confidence interval [CI]: 824–2,993) within KBNP and at 2,244 (95\% CI: 1,471–3,422) in OCR. Eastern chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii) numbers were estimated at 2,500 (95\% CI: 1,804–3,462) in KBNP and 687 (95\% CI: 472–999) in OCR. Estimates of total numbers for the survey area were 5,252 (95\% CI: 3,687–7,481) Grauer's gorillas and 4,275 (95\% CI: 3,322–5,502) eastern chimpanzees. Chimpanzee numbers were not significantly different from the estimates in the mid-1990s but the gorillas had significantly declined, mostly in KBNP. Modeled densities of these apes indicated that distances to mines, villages, or roads significantly explained part of the distribution of these apes, with higher densities also found in more rugged and remote sites. Other primates have all declined in this region, likely due to bushmeat hunting, especially the Endangered Ulindi River Red Colobus Piliocolobus lulindicus. These results confirm the negative impact of insecurity on Grauer's gorilla but indicate that the population declines may not be as great as previously feared. Using our revised gorilla density estimate we revise the original estimate of global numbers from 3,800 to 6,800 individuals.},

  abstract = {Techniques for estimation of absolute abundance of wildlife Populations have received a lot of attention in recent years, The statistical research has been focused on intensive small-scale studies. Recently. however. wildlife biologists have desired to study populations of animals at very large scales for monitoring purposes. Population indices are widely used in these extensive monitoring programs because they are inexpensive compared to estimates of absolute abundance. A crucial underlying assumption is that the population index (0 is directly proportional to the Population density (D), The proportionality constant.. is simply the probability of 'detection' for animals in the survey. As spatial and temporal comparisons of indices are crucial, it is necessary to also assume that the probability of detection is constant over space and time. Biologists intuitively recognize this when they design rigid protocols for the studies where the indices are collected. Unfortunately. however, in many field studies the assumption is clearly invalid. We believe that the estimation of detection probability should be built into the monitoring design through a double sampling approach. A large sample of points provides an abundance index, and a smaller sub-sample of the same point,, is used to estimate detection probability. There is an important need for statistical research on the design and analysis of these complex studies. Some basic concepts based on actual avian. amphibian, and fish monitoring studies are presented in this article. Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley Sons Ltd.},

In addition, correlation functions –developed initially for problems outside forestry – enable analysis and characterization of forest stand structures, generating more accessible information. This paper outlines a classification of structural indices measuring alpha diversity and examines typical representatives of the classification groups such as the Shannon index, the aggregation index of Clark and Evans, the contagion index, the coefficient of segregation of Pielou, the mingling index, the diameter differentiation index, the pair correlation and the mark correlation function. These can be used to measure differences between forests in time and space, to generate forest structures, to analyse the differences between observed and expected structures and to characterize modifications of forest structure resulting from selective harvesting. These algorithms are the keys for assessing complex forest structures, which can be the result of continuous cover forestry methods. Continuous cover forests with selective harvesting are being promoted in the new forest policies of Britain. Case studies have shown that from given spatial forest structures one can possibly conclude the suitability for habitats, a hypothesis which has yet to be proved by further appropriate analysis. The equations for the quantification of stand structure presented in this paper have the advantage that they are easier to survey during forest inventory than the more direct measures of ecological variety.},

  abstract = {Abundance estimates are important to management of most harvested species of wildlife. In West Greenland, recent estimates of barren-ground caribou Rangifer tarandus groenlandicus population size have been derived from aerial surveys conducted in early March of numerous short (7.5 km) transects that focused on obtaining high detection probabilities. The resultant study area coverage was low ({$<$}= 1.6\%), in part due to the survey design. In this article, we conducted a critical review of the current West Greenland caribou survey methodology using data from past surveys and recent GPS collar data, and present recommendations to improve the methodology. On an annual basis, movement rates of collared females were lowest in March, supporting survey timing. March distribution of collared caribou, however, differed markedly between 2009 and 2010, indicating that stratification flights prior to each survey are required to produce the most accurate and precise estimates. A viewshed analysis in GIS supported the use of a 300-m strip width, but demonstrated that the current 15-m survey flight altitude resulted in 4-5\% availability bias due to the portion of the strip width hidden by topography and out of sight of observers, and a corresponding nil detection probability for caribou in these areas. A 30-m or 45-m flight height may be more appropriate to reduce the availability bias in this rugged terrain. Examination of the population composition data collected during and after abundance estimates suggested that robust calf:cow and bull:cow ratio data could be obtained with less sampling effort distributed proportionate to the population density. We suggest that systematic strip transects should be considered to increase survey coverage; this design would increase survey efficiency (ratio of helicopter time to coverage) and inherently increase precision. Distance sampling collected by group would be an improvement over the current negatively biased, transect-total method to calculate detection probabilities. Managers should ensure that sufficient resources are available to obtain robust estimates of abundance and composition of West Greenland caribou. These recommendations may be applicable to other areas in which ungulate populations exist in heterogeneous habitats with low sightability.},

Here, we use information from creel surveys in a removal-sampling framework to estimate total numbers of anglers using six reservoirs in Nebraska, USA, and we examine the influence of the duration of sampling period on those estimates. Population estimates (N +/- SE) of unique anglers were 2050 +/- 45 for Branched Oak Lake, 1992 +/- 29 for Calamus Reservoir, 929 +/- 10 for Harlan County Reservoir, 985 +/- 24 for Lake McConaughy, 1277 +/- 24 for Merritt Reservoir, and 916 +/- 18 for Pawnee Lake during April-October 2015. Shortening the sampling period by one or more months generally resulted in a greater effect on estimates of precision than on estimates of overall abundance. No relationship existed between abundances of unique anglers and angling pressures across reservoirs and sampling duration, indicative of a decoupling of angler abundance and angling pressure. The approach outlined herein has potential to provide defendable answers to “how many are there?”, questions we ask when subjects cannot be marked, which should provide new insights about angler populations and subpopulations.

  abstract = {Conservation outcomes are principally achieved through the protection of intact habitat or the restoration of degraded habitat. Restoration is generally considered a lower priority action than protection because protection is thought to provide superior outcomes, at lower costs, without the time delay required for restoration. Yet while it is broadly accepted that protected intact habitat safeguards more biodiversity and generates greater ecosystem services per unit area than restored habitat, conservation lacks a theory that can coherently compare the relative outcomes of the two actions. We use a dynamic landscape model to integrate these two actions into a unified conservation theory of protection and restoration. Using nonlinear benefit functions, we show that both actions are crucial components of a conservation strategy that seeks to optimise either biodiversity conservation or ecosystem services provision. In contrast to conservation orthodoxy, in some circumstances, restoration should be strongly preferred to protection. The relative priority of protection and restoration depends on their costs and also on the different time lags that are inherent to both protection and restoration. We derive a simple and easy-to-interpret heuristic that integrates these factors into a single equation that applies equally to biodiversity conservation and ecosystem service objectives. We use two examples to illustrate the theory: bird conservation in tropical rainforests and coastal defence provided by mangrove forests.},

  abstract = {The Key Largo woodrat (Neotoma floridana smalli) is an endangered rodent with a restricted geographic range and small population size. Establishing an efficient monitoring program of its abundance has been problematic; previous trapping designs have not worked well because the species is sparsely distributed. We compared Key Largo woodrat abundance estimates in Key Largo, Florida, USA, obtained using trapping point transects (TPT) and spatially explicit capture-recapture (SECR) based on statistical properties, survey effort, practicality, and cost. Both methods combine aspects of distance sampling with capture-recapture, but TPT relies on radiotracking individuals to estimate detectability and SECR relies on repeat capture information to estimate densities of home ranges. Abundance estimates using TPT in the spring of 2007 and 2008 were 333 woodrats (CV = 0.46) and 696 (CV = 0.43), respectively. Abundance estimates using SECR in the spring, summer, and winter of 2007 were 97 (CV = 0.31), 334 (CV = 0.26), and 433 (CV = 0.20) animals, respectively. Trapping point transects used approximately 960 person-hours and 1,010 trap-nights/season. Spatially explicit capture-recapture used approximately 500 person-hours and 6,468 trap-nights/season. Significant time was saved in the SECR survey by setting large numbers of traps close together, minimizing time walking between traps. Trapping point transects were practical to implement in the field, and valuable auxiliary information on Key Largo woodrat behavior was obtained via radiocollaring. In this particular study, detectability of the woodrat using TPT was very low and consequently the SECR method was more efficient. Both methods require a substantial investment in survey effort to detect any change in abundance because of large uncertainty in estimates. (C) 2016 The Wildlife Society.},

One such area, the Minkébé National Park (MNP), Gabon, was created chiefly for its reputation of harboring a large elephant population. MNP held the highest densities of elephants in Central Africa at the turn of the century, and was considered a critical sanctuary for forest elephants because of its relatively large size and isolation. We assessed population change in the park and its surroundings between 2004 and 2014. Using two independent modeling approaches, we estimated a 78–81\% decline in elephant numbers over ten years — a loss of more than 25,000 elephants. While poaching occurs from within Gabon, cross-border poaching largely drove the precipitous drop in elephant numbers. With nearly 50\% of forest elephants in Central Africa thought to reside in Gabon  [1] , their loss from the park is a considerable setback for the preservation of the species.},

  abstract = {In many coastal regions throughout the world, there is increasing pressure to harden shorelines to protect human infrastructures against sea level rise, storm surge, and erosion. This study examines waterbird community integrity in relation to shoreline hardening and land use characteristics at three geospatial scales: (1) the shoreline scale characterized by seven shoreline types: bulkhead, riprap, developed, natural marsh, Phragmites-dominated marsh, sandy beach, and forest; (2) the local subestuary landscape scale including land up to 500 m inland of the shoreline; and (3) the watershed scale ¿ 500 m from the shoreline. From 2010 to 2014, we conducted waterbird surveys along the shoreline and open water within 21 subestuaries throughout the Chesapeake Bay during two seasons to encompass post-breeding shorebirds and colonial waterbirds in late summer and migrating and wintering waterfowl in late fall. We employed an Index of Waterbird Community Integrity (IWCI) derived from mean abundance of individual waterbird species and scores of six key species attributes describing each species' sensitivity to human disturbance, and then used this index to characterize communities in each subestuary and season. IWCI scores ranged from 14.3 to 19.7. Multivariate regression model selection showed that the local shoreline scale had the strongest influence on IWCI scores. At this scale, percent coverage of bulkhead and Phragmites along shorelines were the strongest predictors of IWCI, both with negative relationships. Recursive partitioning revealed that when subestuary shoreline coverage exceeded thresholds of approximately 5\% Phragmites or 8\% bulkhead, IWCI scores decreased. Our results indicate that development at the shoreline scale has an important effect on waterbird community integrity, and that shoreline hardening and invasive Phragmites each have a negative effect on waterbirds using subestuarine systems.},

The rationale is that increased accessibility of the best available evidence will provide a more efficient and less biased platform for decision making. We argue that there are significant benefits for conservation in using such a framework, but the scientific community needs to undertake and disseminate more systematic reviews before the full benefit can be realized. We devised a set of guidelines for undertaking formalized systematic review, based on a health services model. The guideline stages include planning and conducting a review, including protocol formation, search strategy, data inclusion, data extraction, and analysis. Review dissemination is addressed in terms of current developments and future plans for a Web-based open-access library. By the use of case studies we highlight critical modifications to guidelines for protocol formulation, data-quality assessment, data extraction, and data synthesis for conservation and environmental management. Ecological data presented significant but soluble challenges for the systematic review process, particularly in terms of the quantity, accessibility, and diverse quality of available data. In the field of conservation and environmental management there needs to be further engagement of scientists and practitioners to develop and take ownership of an evidence-based framework.},

We used power analysis to determine sample size adequacy when varying the number of visits, count stations, and years for examining trends in abundance. We assumed an overdispersed Poisson distribution for count data, with overdispersion attributed to observer variability, and used Poisson regression for analysis of population trends. Overdispersion had a large, negative effect on power. The number of sampling years also had an especially large effect on power. In all cases, 10 years of sampling were insufficient to detect a decline in abundance of 30\% over 10 years. Increasing the sampling period to 20 years provided adequate power for 56\% of breeding species at one site. The number of count stations needed for detecting trends for a given species depended primarily on observer variability. If observer variability was high, increasing the number of years and visits was a better approach than increasing the number of stations. Increasing the number of stations was most beneficial for species with low abundance or low observer variability. When the number of stations is limited by the size of the area, we recommend multiple visits to stations. For most species, multiple visits per year (six or more) for 15-20 years were needed to detect a 30\% decreasing trend in 10 years with adequate power. We suggest potentially useful focal species for monitoring, such as keystone species like the Acorn Woodpecker (Melanerpesformicivorus).},

The cover estimates by the three methods were compared with 'true' values measured on photographs using an image analysis technique. VE had the highest accuracy, precision and sensitivity. PF systematically overestimated cover. The greatest drawback of PF was the low sensitivity to species detection. It failed to detect 22-30\% of the species in two forests and a bog. SF has high precision and sensitivity but low accuracy. Time consumption on one quadrat was about 6 min for VE and SF, 8.5 min for PE Inter- and intra-person error with the three methods depends on plants. Inter-person error with VE was slightly greater for small and wide-spread plants, especially mosses, than for other life-forms. For wide-spread plants, intra-person error was slightly greater with PF than with the other methods. VE and PF are strongly correlated and convertible, but SF is neither correlated nor convertible with the other methods.},

  abstract = {Aims Knowledge of species richness is of prime importance to both basic and applied aspects of ecological studies. However, quantifying plant species richness in the tropics is potentially time-consuming because of high species diversity. Plant species richness estimates are also frequently biased, because many rare species are not detected. To address these problems, the use of a variable area method has been proposed as an alternative to fixed area methods, but its applicability to plants with aggregated distributions has been questioned based on simulation studies. We use empirical data to compare the efficiency and accuracy of a variable area method and a fixed area method for estimating species richness, density and basal area for plants with aggregated distributions, using palms as a model taxon. Methods Adult palms were sampled in twenty 10 x 30 m transects in an Atlantic Forest in Rio de Janeiro state, Brazil. All individuals were considered in the fixed area method, while in the variable area method only the first six adults in each transect were sampled; in this case, transect length was defined according to the distance of the sixth adult from the beginning of the transect. When fewer than six individuals were observed in a given transect, transect length was extended up to 50 m to search for additional individuals. The efficiency of both methods was compared based on species rarefaction curves, using the Chao 1 statistic (for abundance data). For each species we calculated mean density per transect and basal area, according to each sampling method. Sampling effort in terms of the number of individual plants and the area necessary to characterize maximum species richness in each sampling method, as well as mean time taken to sample a single transect, were compared as measures of efficiency. Important findings An accurate estimate of species richness was achieved using both methods, but in the variable area method, a quarter of the number of individuals and half the area was sufficient to characterize maximum species richness. Density and basal area did not differ between methods for any of the species studied. In the fixed area method sampling effort was 90 min per transect, whereas in the variable area method it was 30 min per transect. The variable area method, with its faster assessment of palm species richness, should facilitate greater spatial representativeness by making it easier to sample a larger number of plots at different spatial scales. We thus find sufficient evidence to recommend the variable area method for rapid and robust evaluations of species richness for palms with aggregate distributions, as well as for other plants with similar spatial patterns, in tropical forests.},

Published information is not always flawless and errors in published research should be expediently reported, preferably by a peer-review process. We review a recent publication by Gopalaswamy et al. (10.1111/2041-210X.12351) that challenges the use of “double sampling” in large-scale animal surveys. Double sampling is often resorted to as an established economical and practical approach for large-scale surveys since it calibrates abundance indices against absolute abundance, thereby potentially addressing the statistical shortfalls of indices. Empirical data used by Gopalaswamy et al. (10.1111/2041-210X.12351) to test their theoretical model, relate to tiger sign and tiger abundance referred to as an Index-Calibration experiment (IC-Karanth). These data on tiger abundance and signs should be paired in time and space to qualify as a calibration experiment for double sampling, but original data of IC-Karanth show lags of (up to) several years. Further, data points used in the paper do not match the original sources. We show that by use of inappropriate and incorrect data collected through a faulty experimental design, poor parameterization of their theoretical model, and selectively picked estimates from literature on detection probability, the inferences of this paper are highly questionable. We highlight how the results of Gopalaswamy et al. were further distorted in popular media. If left unaddressed, the paper of Gopalaswamy et al. could have serious implications on statistical design of large-scale animal surveys by propagating unreliable inferences.},

We compared detection probabilities for boreal forest songbirds using traditional point count methods and counts using broadcasts of the mobbing calls of Black-capped Chickadees (Poecile atricapillus) in an attempt to increase detection probability. We conducted 594 point counts during the 2010 breeding season in Newfoundland, Canada. Each point count consisted of an 8-min silent observation period followed by an 8-min broadcast of Black-capped Chickadee mobbing calls. Occupancy model results showed that response to playback broadcast varied across species, with detection probabilities higher for seven of 17 species during the silent portions of point counts and three species more likely to be detected during playback intervals. For all species, the number of visual detections increased during periods of playback and, averaged across species, individuals were ¿6 times more likely to be seen during the playback period than during the silent period. Differences in detection probability among observers were apparent during both silent and playback periods. We suggest that using playback of chickadee mobbing calls during point count surveys of common boreal forest songbird species may be most beneficial when visual detection is important. However, playback may also be useful for species-specific surveys during periods when birds are less likely to be vocal or for studies of less common species with chronically low detection probabilities. A combined silent and playback approach could also be useful, although observer and species differences should be accounted for if comparing data across species or studies. RESUMEN Efecto variable de las grabaciones de conducta de turbas en Poecile atricapillus, en la probabilidad de detectar aves en un bosque boreal Modificaciones en los conteos de puntos, para incluir grabaciones de llamadas de turbas, en el intento de incrementar las probabilidades de deteccion de aves han tenido resultados mixtos. Comparamos la probabilidad de deteccion para aves en bosques boreales, utilizando conteos de puntos tradicionales y llamadas de turbas del Carbonero Cabecinegro (Poecile atricapillus), en un intento de incrementar la probabilidad de deteccion de aves. Se condujeron 594 conteos de puntos durante el periodo reproductivo del 2010, en Newfoundland, Canada. Cada punto consistio de 8 minutos de observacion en silencio, seguido de 8 minutos de una grabacion de la llamada de turba del Carbonero Cabecinegro. El modelo utilizado mostro que la respuesta a las grabaciones varia entre especies, con una alta probabilidad de deteccion de siete de 17 especies durante los periodos de silencio y de tres especies adicionales durante la exposicion a grabaciones. Para todas las especies, el numero de detecciones visuales incremento durante los periodos de uso de grabaciones y el promedio entre todas estas, resulto con una probabilidad seis veces mayor de ser detectado, que durante los periodos de silencio. Entre observadores, encontramos diferencias en la probabilidad de deteccion, tanto durante los periodos de silencio como cuando se utilizaron grabaciones. Sugerimos el uso de grabaciones de llamadas de turba del carbonero, durante conteos de punto en bosques boreales, ya que puede ser de gran beneficio cuando la deteccion visual es importante. No obstante, el uso de grabaciones tambien pudiera ser util para censos de especies particulares durante el periodo en que la probabilidad de escuchar sus voces sea bajo, o para estudios con especies cuya probabilidades de detectarlas sea reducido. Una combinacion de conteos silenciosos y uso de grabaciones pudieran ser de utilidad, aunque se debe tomar en consideracion las diferencias en la capacidad de deteccion que pueda haber entre observadores y especies para comparar datos entre especies y estudios.},

  abstract = {Broad-leaved subtropical forests are the most productive, diversified, and complex ecosystems on the planet. Unfortunately, they are currently under severe threat from anthropogenic activities, such as. deforestation, housing settlements, and agricultural expansion. In response to these severe effects, the present study was conducted to explore the current conservation status and population structure of a wide range of bird species inhabiting different subtropical broad-leaved urban forests of Pakistan. In total, 2879 individuals comprising 53 species and 28 families were detected between December 2017 and November 2018 as revealed through the distance sampling line transect method. The habitat selection among bird species varied according to vegetation structure and composition, food resources, adjoining habitats, and human settlements. According to IUCN Red List data, one species was deemed vulnerable out of 53 bird species, while the remaining 52 species were ranked as ofleast concern. The findings of the density analysis revealed that bird density varied between six subtropical broad-leaved forests. Palamar (3.954 +/- 0.221 birds/ha) and Kityari (3.138 +/- 0.162 birds/ha) were densely populated, whereas Kamal Khan (1.102 +/- 0.178 birds/ha) was of the least concern. Likewise, the diversity analysis showed that Kamal Khan was a more diverse habitat (Shannon-Wiener Index; H' = 3.581 +/- 0.021). Shahabad was richer (Margalef Richness Index; R1 = 8.007 +/- 0.053) and Dob Ghar was evenly distributed (Pielou J Evenness Index; E = 0.940 +/- 0.005) compared to other urban habitats studied. Eight foraging guilds were identified among the bird species. Insectivores were the most abundant bird species utilizing the urban dwelling habitats. carnivores/piscivores/insectivores utilized Dob Ghar forest, while more frugivores utilized Kamal Khan and Dob Ghar. Based on the data, it was concluded that subtropical broad-leaved urban forests are dynamic, complex, and of vital significance for a diverse range of bird species.},

In this paper, we develop a socio-economicecological model of optimal management of wildlife preservation areas through incorporating the environmental preferences of local communities. These preferences are dynamic and influenced by local economic growth. When environmental preferences of local communities are brought in sync with those of the regulators, monitoring and regulatory policies aimed at curbing illegal smuggling become efficacious. Our results indicate that when communities residing in the vicinity of wildlife protection areas see a rapid change in their environmental preferences owing to economic development within the region, it aids in biodiversity protection by making stringent monitoring and regulatory measures acceptable. However, promoting economic development may require providing higher access to biodiversity preservation areas in the initial stages even if it comes at the cost of mild habitat degradation. When the probability of catching illegal smugglers is a function of cooperation received from the local inhabitants, it is optimal to invest in policy measures that improve local economic well-being and willingness to cooperate before increasing monitoring efforts.},

The Kilombero Valley Floodplain Ramsar site in Tanzania has been subject to an increasing level of disturbance, but harbors the endemic Kilombero Weaver, Kilombero Cisticola and White-tailed Cisticola, as well as several other species of local, national and global importance. Using point counts over a year, we studied seasonal patterns in bird species richness, diversity and abundance, as related to habitat types in the riparian zone along the Kilombero River. Particular focus was on Important Bird and Biodiversity Area (IBA) `trigger' species. Richness, abundance and diversity were highest in July, just after the wet season, and lowest in March when the water level started rising. The endemic Kilombero Weaver (Ploceus burnieri) was by far the most common species. Reeds and grass-bush habitats had the highest bird diversity throughout, and all three endemic taxa showed a preference for these vegetation types. After decades of increasing human disturbance, Kilombero still qualify as an IBA. Large numbers of livestock have recently been evicted from the area, and this study could serve as a benchmark on how this change will affect bird populations in the future.},

However, species density was constant between seasons. Intensity of habitat use in vegetation types was different among species. M. guatemalae used more tropical forest that its availability, G ridgwayi used more secondary oak forest, and S. squamulata used more secondary tropical forest.

We compared estimates of detection probability and density from distance and time-removal models and survey protocols based on 5- or 10-min counts and outer radii of 50 or 100 m. We surveyed singing male Acadian flycatchers (Empidonax virescens), cerulean warblers (Dendroica cerulea), Kentucky warblers (Oporornis formosus), Louisiana waterthrushes (Parkesia motacilla), wood thrushes (Hylocichla mustelina), and worm-eating warblers (Helmitheros vermivorum) in bottomland and upland forest across 5 states in the Central Hardwoods Bird Conservation Region during the breeding season in 2007 and 2008. Detection probabilities differed between distance and time-removal models and species detectabilities were affected differently by year, forest type, and state. Density estimates from distance models were generally higher than from time-removal models, resulting from lower detection probabilities estimated by distance models. We found support for individual heterogeneity (modeled as a finite mixture model) in the time-removal models and that 50-m radius counts generated density estimates approximately twice as high as 100-m radius counts. Users should be aware that in addition to estimating different components of detectability, density estimates derived from distance and time-removal models can be affected by survey protocol because some count durations and plot radii may better meet model assumptions than others. The choice of a method may not affect the use of estimates for relative comparisons (e. g., when comparing habitats) but could affect conclusions when used to estimate population size. We recommend careful consideration of assumptions when deciding on point-count protocol and selection of analysis methods. (C) 2011 The Wildlife Society.},

Their breeding range is becoming increasingly urbanized and habitat loss and fragmentation are a main threat to the species' viability. Objectives We investigated the effects of remotely sensed local habitat and landscape attributes on point occupancy and density of warblers in an urban preserve and produced a spatially explicit density map for the preserve using model-supported relationships. Methods We conducted 1507 point-count surveys during spring 2011-2014 across Balcones Canyonlands Preserve (BCP) to evaluate warbler habitat associations and predict density of males. We used hierarchical Bayesian models to estimate multiple components of detection probability and evaluate covariate effects on detection probability, point occupancy, and density. Results Point occupancy was positively related to landscape forest cover and local canopy cover; mean occupancy was 0.83. Density was influenced more by local than landscape factors. Density increased with greater amounts of juniper and mixed forest and decreased with more open edge. There was a weak negative relationship between density and landscape urban land cover. Conclusions Landscape composition and habitat structure were important determinants of warbler occupancy and density, and the large intact patches of juniper and mixed forest on BCP ([ 2100 ha) supported a high density of warblers. Increasing urbanization and fragmentation in the surrounding landscape will likely result in lower breeding density due to loss of juniper and mixed forest and increasing urban land cover and edge.},

  abstract = {Presence-absence surveys are a commonly used method for monitoring broad-scale changes in wildlife distributions. However, the lack of power of these surveys for detecting population trends is problematic for their application in wildlife management. Options for improving power include increasing the sampling effort or arbitrarily relaxing the type I error rate. We present an alternative, whereby targeted sampling of particular habitats in the landscape using information from a habitat model increases power. The advantage of this approach is that it does not require a trade-off with either cost or the Pr(type I error) to achieve greater power. We use a demographic model of koala (Phascolarctos cinereus) population dynamics and simulations of the monitoring process to estimate the power to detect a trend in occupancy for a range of strategies, thereby demonstrating that targeting particular habitat qualities can improve power substantially. If the objective is to detect a decline in occupancy, the optimal strategy is to sample high-quality habitats. Alternatively, if the objective is to detect an increase in occupancy, the optimal strategy is to sample intermediate-quality habitats. The strategies with the highest power remained the same under a range of parameter assumptions, although observation error had a strong influence on the optimal strategy. Our approach specifically applies to monitoring for detecting long-term trends in occupancy or abundance. This is a common and important monitoring objective for wildlife managers, and we provide guidelines for more effectively achieving it.},

  abstract = {The Caatinga, the largest region of seasonally dry tropical forest in the Neotropics, suffers high rates of deforestation and habitat degradation, mostly due to wood extraction. As an alternative to illegal logging, governments have looked at more sustainable management schemes, allowing natural regeneration after logging through relatively long (similar to 25-year) harvest rotations. We investigated the impacts of forest management at a 1,700-ha privately owned area located at the Araripe Plateau, in the semiarid interior of northeastern Brazil, focusing on the population parameters of 8 avian species. The property was subdivided into 22 forest stands, where a different stand has been logged every year since 2004. By 2016, when we sampled the avifauna, 12 forest stands had already been logged and allowed to regrow, creating a landscape of logged and unlogged stands and a 12-year forest recovery chrono-sequence. We conducted distance-based sampling along transects to estimate the density and abundance of these species in logged and unlogged stands. We found that logging impacted 3 of the target species. Two of them (Megaxenops parnaguae and Synallaxis scutata) were less abundant, whereas another (Sclerurus cearensis) disappeared altogether from logged areas. We also found a positive correlation between the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and the avian density of the affected species. However, we failed to observe any significant relationship between forest recovery or NDVI and species densities, suggesting that even after 12 years of forest recovery, species abundance remains lower in logged than in unlogged areas. We found that logging impacted birds in a species-specific manner, with 5 species unaffected and 3 species declining. Although our sampling occurred half-way through the regeneration cycle, we found no evidence of recovery for those species most affected. We suggest keeping unlogged areas intermingled with logged stands, allowing the survival and potential recovery of species in regenerating forests.},

We established narrow linear (approx. 3-m-wide) and nonlinear field borders on farms in agriculture-dominated and forest-dominated landscapes in the Coastal Plain of North Carolina, USA, after collecting pretreatment data on summer bobwhite abundance. After establishment of field borders, summer bobwhite abundance nearly doubled on farms in agriculture-dominated landscapes and increased approximately 57\% on farms with nonlinear field borders. Summer bobwhite abundance did not increase on farms with linear field borders in forest-dominated landscapes. Nonlinear and narrow linear field borders can be used to increase bobwhite numbers on farms in landscapes dominated by agriculture. Less flexibility exists in forest-dominated landscapes, where we found only nonlinear field borders resulted in an increase.},

Distance and multiple-observer methods require the sometimes unlikely assumption that all birds in the population are available (i.e., sing or are visible) during a count, but the time-of-detection method allows for the possibility that some birds are unavailable during the count. We combined the dependent double-observer method with the time-of-detection method and obtained field-based estimates of the components of detection probability for northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus). Our approach was a special case of Pollock's robust capture-recapture design where the probability that a bird does not sing is analogous to the probability that an animal is a temporary emigrant. Top models indicated that observers' detection probabilities were similar (0.78-0.84) if bobwhite were available, but bobwhite only had an approximately 0.61 probability of being available during a 2.5-minute sampling interval. Additionally, observers' detection probabilities increased substantially after the initial encounter with an individual bobwhite (analogous to a trap-happy response on the part of the observer). A simulated data set revealed that the combined method was precise when availability and detection given availability were substantially lower. Combined methods approaches can provide critical information for researchers and land managers to make decisions regarding survey length and personnel requirements for point-count-based surveys.},

We introduce the unreconciled double-observer method, an independent double-observer method that does not require observers to match or otherwise reconcile individual observations. The modeling of the counts uses the repeated-counts model (Royle 2004). We compared estimates of detection probability and abundance from the unreconciled double-observer method with estimates from the traditional independent double-observer method (which requires matching of individual animals) using field-simulated bird-point-count data. The unreconciled double-observer method provided point estimates of detection probability and abundance that were essentially identical to the results of the independent double-observer method, even though much less effort was required to collect data with the unreconciled method. Estimates of detection probability from the unreconciled double-observer method were usually less precise and estimates of abundance always less precise than those from the independent double-observer method, because there is less information available in the unreconciled double-observer approach. We also evaluated the unreconciled double-observer method on 12 Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) routes. The unreconciled double-observer method provided estimates of route-level abundance for most routes and for most of the 20 species we considered. We believe that this method has potential for established bird-monitoring programs such as the BBS because no changes in historical data-collection methods are required other than collecting data simultaneously using two or more observers.

A double-observer method was used to estimate detection probability near the transect line (g(0) = 0.724). Detection of cormorants was not consistent but varied based on group size, location (water, land, flying), and season. Probability of detection in the area covered by the survey was often below 0.5. Incorporating both lack of detection on the flight line along with lack of detection over the covered area inherent in distance sampling provided defensible density estimates of free-ranging double-crested cormorants. Most cormorants were detected loafing on shore (land) among the many islands defining this area of the Lake Huron coast. Land detections exceeded the combined detections of birds on the water and flying. Density in 2004 ranged from a peak of 2.30 cormorants per km(2) (95\% CI = 1.72-3.03) in late July to 1.21 cormorants per km(2) (95\% Cl = 0.78-1.70) in late August in the sampled areas extending from shore to approximately 20 km offshore. Aerial surveys employing distance sampling can be useful tools in monitoring the distribution and abundance of free-ranging double-crested cormorants and other waterbirds in the Laurentian Great Lakes.

Simultaneous modeling of the population dynamics of multiple species provides an interesting mechanism to examine patterns in community processes and, as we emphasize herein, to improve species-specific estimates by leveraging detection information among species. Here, we demonstrate a simple but effective approach to share information about observation parameters among species in hierarchical community abundance and occupancy models, where we use shared random effects among species to account for spatiotemporal heterogeneity in detection probability. We demonstrate the efficacy of our modeling approach using simulated abundance data, where we recover well our simulated parameters using N-mixture models. Our approach substantially increases precision in estimates of abundance compared with models that do not share detection information among species. We then expand this model and apply it to repeated detection/non-detection data collected on six species of tits (Paridae) breeding at 119 1 km(2) sampling sites across a P. montanus hybrid zone in northern Switzerland (2004-2020). We find strong impacts of forest cover and elevation on population persistence and colonization in all species. We also demonstrate evidence for interspecific competition on population persistence and colonization probabilities, where the presence of marsh tits reduces population persistence and colonization probability of sympatric willow tits, potentially decreasing gene flow among willow tit subspecies. While conceptually simple, our results have important implications for the future modeling of population abundance, colonization, persistence, and trajectories in community frameworks. We suggest potential extensions of our modeling in this paper and discuss how leveraging data from multiple species can improve model performance and sharpen ecological inference.},

Depressional forested wetlands are often surrounded by larger, continuous patches of upland forest, and it is not clear whether this Surrounding forest should be considered part of the forested wetland. To contribute regional data to this question, we sampled birds and vegetation in depressional forested wetlands in southern Michigan, USA. Results indicated that the wetland per se should not be considered separate from the surrounding forest because forest area and forest characteristics were the most important predictors of richness and abundance of wetland-associated birds. Conversely, wetland area and wetland characteristics were important for some upland species. Because spatial clustering and model selection uncertainty are often encountered by wetland scientists, we describe analytical methods used to deal with these problems.},

We used mixed effects logistic regression models to estimate effects of those factors and to estimate and visualize the variation in the area around the observer where birds can be perceived (the perception area). We simulated surveys with 8,926 binary opportunities for detection in Minnesota grasslands in 2011 and 2012. Species, distance to the observer, wind speed and direction, observer, and density of vegetation all affected detection of recorded bird songs. Species had a strong effect; the size of the predicted perception area around the observer differed by an order of magnitude among species. Wind also had a strong effect on detection. As wind speed increased, probability of detection downwind of the observer was reduced and the perception area around the observer became smaller and more asymmetrical. The effective distance at which an observer is more likely to detect a bird than not detect it may differ among species and angles to the wind, even within the same survey. Eight of 10 species had low probability of misidentification (¡= 0.03), but Grasshopper Sparrow (Ammodramus savannarum) and LeConte's Sparrow (Ammospiza leconteii) were frequently misidentified (probability = 0.09-0.24 among observers), contributing to a low rate of correct detection for those species. We recommend collecting point-count data within distance bands so that data can be analyzed based on the effective radius for each species and standardizing surveys across wind conditions to reduce variation in detection probability.},

The effectiveness and suitability of each method depends on the study's objectives, but is also influenced by many important traits, including detection probability, disturbance of focal birds and sampling frequency. We reviewed 504 greater sage-grouse Centrocercus urophasianus papers published from 1990 to 2019 to document the most common brood survey methods used by investigators and summarized if and how they used brood survey data to estimate brood survival and detection probability. Of the 504 papers, 16.1\% (n = 81) had useful information relevant to the review. The most common methods included daytime visual surveys (46.9\%; n = 38), daytime flush surveys (33.3\%; n = 27), nocturnal spotlight surveys (19.8\%; n = 16), radio-tagged chicks (16.0\%; n = 13), wing surveys (9.9\%; n = 8), brood routes (4.9\%; n = 4) and pointing dogs (4.9\%; n = 4). Fifty-nine of the 81 papers used ¿1 method, only 2 of the 81 papers measured or reported detection probability, and none reported the level of disturbance caused by the method. Studies varied widely regarding the age of the brood when brood fate was confirmed (x = 44.4 days post-hatch, range 14-84 days). The frequency of brood sampling visits also varied greatly among studies (range = 1.19-3.85 surveys/brood/week) and this variation complicates comparison in fecundity and survival estimates across studies. Furthermore, 35 papers used ¿1 maternal behavior as purported indicators of brood fate, but none of them documented how accurate their indicators were. Future studies could reduce variance in estimates of sage-grouse fecundity and brood survival by employing empirical methods to estimate detection probability, standardizing brood sampling methods and conducting trials to document the effects of hen or brood capture, handling and flushing on brood survival estimates. Moreover, the accuracy of commonly used indicators of brood fate, including maternal behaviors, flocking behavior and distance moved after flush needs verification.},

  abstract = {The negative impact of bushmeat hunting on prey species has been frequently claimed, but little thought has been given to how the level of hunting should most appropriately be measured. Current methods range from qualitative descriptions to quantified measures, and in many cases these are used to infer the biological impact of hunting, when they are in fact economic measures of the effort invested by a hunter. The choice of measure used has important implications for correctly attributing observed levels of prey abundance to a particular level of hunting, and for the use of hunting statistic data as an index of abundance. Using information from over 200 hunter follows and eight hunting camp diaries collected over a 15 month period in Equatorial Guinea, we investigate how hunting effort is most appropriately measured. We explore the use of time as a measure of effort, the effect of hunting method and compare hunter and prey perspectives of catch, in order to investigate the possible sources of bias associated with different measures. We show (1) that total time measures can be biased, overestimating biologically relevant effort; (2) that quantifying trapping effort is problematic due to variable trap checking rates, variable trap group composition and species trap specificity; and (3) that economically relevant measures of catch, taken from the hunter perspective underestimate the true biological impact of hunting. To our knowledge this is the first study to investigate and explicitly quantify the sources of bias that exist between different hunting effort measures. our results have important implications for how future studies should measure hunting effort in order to assess properly the biological impact of bushmeat hunting, but further comparative studies are needed to investigate the existence of biased effort measures in a range of hunting systems.

  abstract = {Growing threats to biodiversity in the tropics mean there is an increasing need for effective monitoring that balances scientific rigor with practical feasibility. Alternatives to professional techniques are emerging that are based on the involvement of local people. Such locally based monitoring methods may be more sustainable over time, allow greater spatial coverage and quicker management decisions, lead to increased compliance, and help encourage attitude shifts toward more environmentally sustainable practices. Nevertheless, few studies have yet compared the findings or cost-effectiveness of locally based methods with professional techniques or investigated the power of locally based methods to detect trends. We gathered data on bushmeat-hunting catch and effort using a professional technique (accompanying hunters on hunting trips) and two locally based methods in which data were collected by hunters (hunting camp diaries and weekly hunter interviews) in a 15-month study in Equatorial Guinea. Catch and effort results from locally based methods were strongly correlated with those of the professional technique and the spatial locations of hunting trips reported in the locally based methods accurately reflected those recorded with the professional technique. We used power simulations of catch and effort data to show that locally based methods can reliably detect meaningful levels of change (20\% change with 80\% power at significance level [alpha] = 0.05) in multispecies catch per unit effort. Locally based methods were the most cost-effective for monitoring. Hunter interviews collected catch and effort data on 240\% more hunts per person hour and 94\% more hunts per unit cost, spent on monitoring, than the professional technique. Our results suggest that locally based monitoring can offer an accurate, cost-effective, and sufficiently powerful method to monitor the status of natural resources. To establish such a system in Equatorial Guinea, the current lack of national and local capacity for monitoring and management must be addressed.},

  abstract = {Understanding the impact of hunting on wildlife populations is crucial to achieving sustainability and requires knowledge of prey abundance responses to different levels of exploitation. While the abundance of primates has been shown to respond independently to hunting and habitat, habitat is rarely considered simultaneously when evaluating the impacts of hunting. Furthermore, the importance of these two factors in determining the abundance of other species has not been well investigated. We evaluate the independent effects of hunting and habitat on the abundance of a diverse assemblage of species, using a series of predictions and data from a study in Equatorial Guinea. Line transect surveys in sites of varying hunting intensity and habitat, and weekly interviews with hunters on current hunting effort in each site, were conducted. We also consider the role of past hunting, and discuss the interrelationships between hunting and habitat variables. We show that for primates, hunting is important in determining abundance, while for rodents and duikers, habitat is more important. Our findings show that the effects of hunting and habitat on abundance vary greatly between species, are often confounded and require an approach that isolates their independent effects to determine the true impact of hunting. Conservation managers must consider and incorporate habitat heterogeneity when managing hunting systems, taking into account the way in which the relative importance of these factors can vary between species.},

Two new estimators were developed based on expanding design-based inclusion probabilities by model-based estimates of the detection probabilities. The new estimators were evaluated in a simulation study as well as in a real forest inventory. It is shown that the nondetection bias of the traditional estimator is up to -52.5\%, whereas the new estimators are approximately unbiased.},

The traditional distance sampling framework is further extended to account for multiple scan positions at a single sample plot and to allow for an imperfect detection probability at distance r = 0. The novel methodology is tested with real world data, as well as in simulations. It is shown that the underlying detection model can be parameterized using only data from single scans. Hereby, it is possible to predict the detection probability also for different sample plot sizes and scanner position layouts in a multi-scan setting. Simulations showed that a minor discretization bias can occur if the sample size is small. The methodology enables a generalized optimization of the scanning layout in a multi-scan setting with respect to the detection probability and the sample plot area. This will increase the efficiency of multi-scan TLS-based forest inventories in the future.},

A sampling technique that should remedy this shortcoming is Point Transect Sampling (Buckland et al. in Introduction to distance sampling: estimating abundance of biological populations. Oxford University Press, Oxford, 2001; Advanced distance sampling: estimating abundance of biological populations. Oxford University Press, Oxford, 2004), where as a matter of principle, all objects that are sighted from a fixed location are counted. We compare Point Transect Sampling with the other well-established sampling approaches for the estimation of volume, necro-mass and carbon storage in terms of precision and sampling effort. It is shown that Point Transect Sampling is the superior method for sampling standing DW regarding efficiency, whereas for sampling downed DW, it is clearly outperformed by Line Intersect Sampling.},

The federally endangered Diamond Darter Crystallaria cincotta is in need of an effective monitoring design to improve our understanding of its distribution and track population trends. Because of their small size, cryptic coloration, and nocturnal behavior, along with limitations associated with current sampling methods, individuals are difficult to detect at known occupied sites. Therefore, research is needed to determine if survey efforts can be improved by increasing probability of individual detection. The primary objective of this study was to determine if there are seasonal and diel patterns in Diamond Darter detectability during population surveys. In addition to temporal factors, we also assessed five habitat variables that might influence individual detection. We used N-mixture models to estimate site abundances and relationships between covariates and individual detectability and ranked models using Akaike's information criteria. During 2015 three known occupied sites were sampled 15 times each between May and Oct. The best supported model included water temperature as a quadratic function influencing individual detectability, with temperatures around 22 C resulting in the highest detection probability. Detection probability when surveying at the optimal temperature was approximately 6\% and 7.5\% greater than when surveying at 16 C and 29 C, respectively. Time of Night and day of year were not strong predictors of Diamond Darter detectability. The results of this study will allow researchers and agencies to maximize detection probability when surveying populations, resulting in greater monitoring efficiency and likely more precise abundance estimates.}

  abstract = {Although investigators have evaluated the efficacy of survey methods for assessing densities of breeding birds, few comparisons have been made of survey methods for wintering birds, especially in grasslands. In winter, social behavior and spatial distributions often differ from those in the breeding season. We evaluated the degree of correspondence between density estimates based on different survey methods. Surveys were conducted during two winters (2001–2002 and 2002–2003) on 16 grassland sites in southwestern Oklahoma. Line-transect (using a detection function to account for birds present but not detected) and area-search (where density was based on the total count within a given area) methods were employed. Observations on line transects were also analyzed as strip transects, where density was based on total count within a given strip width and no detection function was used. Savannah Sparrows (Passerculus sandwichensis), LeConte’s Sparrows (Ammodramus leconteii), Song Sparrows (Melospiza melodia), Smith’s Longspurs (Calcarius pictus), Chestnut-collared Longspurs (C . ornatus), and Eastern Meadowlarks (Sturnella magna) were sufficiently abundant to allow comparison. Area-search density estimates tended to be higher than line-transect estimates for Savannah Sparrows, Song Sparrows, and Eastern Meadowlarks, suggesting that some individuals initially located close to the transect line were not detected on line transects. The area-search and line-transect methods gave similar density estimates for Chestnut-collared and Smith’s longspurs. Area-search estimates of Eastern Meadowlarks were significantly higher in the second year of the study only. For this species, area-search estimates did not differ from those of strip transects covering an equal area, so the reason for the differing meadowlark estimates is not clear. Higher density estimates using the area-search method likely resulted from: (1) birds that might escape detection by hiding were more likely detected (flushed) during area searches because of the repeated passes through the area, and (2) birds close to the line in line transects escape detection by hiding, biasing those estimates low. We also evaluated the correspondence of density rankings for the six species as determined by the different survey methods and for the same species across survey sites. Correlations among the six species of the area-search results with those of line transects and strip transects generally were high, increasing in 2002–2003 when densities of birds were greater. All three methods provided similar density rankings among species. Density rankings within species across sites for the four non-longspur species generally were concordant for the three methods, suggesting that any of them will adequately reflect among-site differences, especially when densities vary greatly across sites. Further research is needed to determine the extent to which grassland birds are missed on line transects. We suggest that workers using line transects to study these species give careful consideration and make additional efforts to satisfy the distance-sampling assumption that all birds on or near the line are detected. If density is measured as a total count in a fixed area, we recommend that observers pass within {$<$}10 m of all points in the area.},

  abstract = {Unsustainable hunting of wildlife or bushmeat for human consumption across the tropics threatens both wildlife populations and the livelihoods of people who depend on these resources. The probability that hunting can be sustainable depends in part on ecological conditions that affect the ‘supply’ of and ‘demand’ for wildlife resources. In this study, supply is estimated across a number of tropical ecosystem types by calculating the theoretical ‘maximum sustainable offtake’ in kg/km2 for harvestable wildlife. Demand is estimated from observed harvests in kg/km2. We examine how supply and demand vary across relatively undisturbed ecosystems, indexed by annual rainfall. Supply is potentially highest in dry forests and wetter savannah grasslands and decreases in moist forests and more xeric grasslands. Demand tends to exceed supply in moist forests and xeric grasslands. Analogous to this ecological variation along the rainfall gradient is the gradient created by the conversion of tropical forests by humans. We hypothesise that the wild meat supply is greater in secondary forests and forest–farm–fallow mosaics than in undisturbed forests and test this with available data. We conclude that the probability that hunting will be sustainable varies with ecosystem type and degree of human disturbance and should influence where land is zoned for protected areas and where for wildlife harvests.},

  abstract = {Fish and wildlife harvest management at large spatial scales often involves making complex decisions with multiple objectives and difficult tradeoffs, population demographics that vary spatially, competing stakeholder values, and uncertainties that might affect management decisions. Structured decision making (SDM) provides a formal decision analytic framework for evaluating difficult decisions by breaking decisions into component parts and separating the values of stakeholders from the scientific evaluation of management actions and uncertainty. The result is a rigorous, transparent, and values-driven process. This decision-aiding process provides the decision maker with a more complete understanding of the problem and the effects of potential management actions on stakeholder values, as well as how key uncertainties can affect the decision. We use a case study to illustrate how SDM can be used as a decision-aiding tool for management decision making at large scales. We evaluated alternative white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) buck-harvest regulations in New York designed to reduce harvest of yearling bucks, taking into consideration the values of the state wildlife agency responsible for managing deer, as well as deer hunters. We incorporated tradeoffs about social, ecological, and economic management concerns throughout the state. Based on the outcomes of predictive models, expert elicitation, and hunter surveys, the SDM process identified management alternatives that optimized competing objectives. The SDM process provided biologists and managers insight about aspects of the buck-harvest decision that helped them adopt a management strategy most compatible with diverse hunter values and management concerns.},

Here we present a first attempt to provide a global framework for the next step of strategically expanding the network to cover mammals, amphibians, freshwater turtles and tortoises, and globally threatened birds. We identify unprotected areas of the world that have remarkably high conservation value (irreplaceability) and are under serious threat. These areas concentrate overwhelmingly in tropical and subtropical moist forests, particularly on tropical mountains and islands. The expansion of the global protected-area network in these regions is urgently needed to prevent the loss of unique biodiversity.},

In this study we aimed to (1) estimate population abundance and density using a less effort-intensive and nonstressful technique, (2) test a long-term monitoring protocol, and (3) assess the fine-scale ecological requirements of a black-colored amphibian, Salamandra atra, in the Italian Alps. For three populations we applied an N-mixture model on data collected using a dependent double-observer approach. To understand ecological requirements, we assessed the relative importance of a set of environmental and topographical variables. The double-observer approach was a cost-effective technique that provided reliable demographic estimates of population density. Our results suggest that the most important fine-scale ecological variables positively associated with salamander abundance were canopy cover and terrain ruggedness, which are strictly related to shelter availability and soil moisture.},

  abstract = {Reptile populations are relevant components of biodiversity in both temperate and tropical forests. However, in forest habitats reptiles are secretive and the complex structure of the environment makes it difficult to assess with confidence their abundance and density. In general, capture-mark-recapture (CMR) or distance sampling (DS) are used to estimate demographic parameters of reptiles in these complex habitats. CMR may be expensive in terms of time, materials and sampling effort, while DS is strongly biased when animals lying on the transect line are overlooked. In this study, we applied a combination of CMR and hierarchical distance sampling (HDS) to esti­ mate the density of the Common Wall Lizard (Podarcis muralis), a widespread Mediterranean terrestrial reptile. We randomly placed linear transects in a deciduous woodland (i.e. Castanea sativa), in a coniferous plantation forest (Pinus nigra) and in a dry prairie habitat, and we applied a hierarchical mark-recapture distance sampling (HMRDS) protocol. Density estimates were similar between the deciduous woodland (47 individuals/ha) and the dry prairie habitat (44 individuals/ha), while markedly lower in the coniferous plantation forest (13 individuals/ ha). HMRDS data, analyzed in a Bayesian framework, showed the importance of correcting for the assumption of complete detection on the transect line, in all the three habitat types. Therefore, our approach should be useful when assessing the density of small and cryptic terrestrial animals, not only in forest but also in habitat with an apparently less complex vegetation structure.},

  abstract = {Counting techniques are widely used to study and monitor terrestrial birds. To assess current applications of counting techniques, we reviewed landbird studies published 1989-1998 in nine major journals and one symposium. Commonly used techniques fell into two groups: procedures that used counts of bird detections as an index to abundance (index counts), and procedures that used empirical models of detectability to estimate density. Index counts rely upon assumptions concerning detectability that are difficult or impossible to meet in most field studies, but nonetheless remain the technique of choice among ornithologists; 95\% of studies we reviewed relied upon point counts, strip transects, or other index procedures. Detectability-based density estimates were rarely used and deserve wider application in landbird studies. Distance sampling is a comprehensive extension of earlier detectability-based procedures (variable-width transects, variable circular plots) and a viable alternative to index counts. We provide a conceptual overview of distance sampling, specific recommendations for applying this technique to studies of landbirds, and an introduction to analysis of distance sampling data using the program DISTANCE.},

Decision makers managing threatened or pest species are regularly faced with this uncertainty. Wildlife diseases can drive species to extinction; thus, managing species with disease is an important part of conservation. Devil facial tumor disease (DFTD) is one such disease that led to the listing of the Tasmanian devil (Sarcophilus harrisii) as endangered. Managers aim to maintain devils in the wild by establishing disease-free insurance populations at isolated sites. Often a resident DFTD-affected population must first be removed. In a successful collaboration between decision scientists and wildlife managers, we used an accessible population model to inform monitoring decisions and facilitate the establishment of an insurance population of devils on Forestier Peninsula. We used a Bayesian catch-effort model to estimate population size of a diseased population from removal and camera trap data. We also analyzed the costs and benefits of declaring the area disease-free prior to reintroduction and establishment of a healthy insurance population. After the monitoring session in May-June 2015, the probability that all devils had been successfully removed was close to 1, even when we accounted for a possible introduction of a devil to the site. Given this high probability and the baseline cost of declaring population absence prematurely, we found it was not cost-effective to carry out any additional monitoring before introducing the insurance population. Considering these results within the broader context of Tasmanian devil management, managers ultimately decided to implement an additional monitoring session before the introduction. This was a conservative decision that accounted for uncertainty in model estimates and for the broader nonmonetary costs of mistakenly declaring the area disease-free.},

  abstract = {1. Calibrating indices of animal abundance to true densities is critical in wildlife studies especially when direct density estimations are precluded by high costs, lack of required data or model parameters, elusiveness and rarity of target species. For studies deploying camera traps, the use of photographic rate (photographs per sampling time) as an index of abundance potentially applies to the majority of terrestrial mammals where individual recognition, and hence capture-recapture analysis, are unfeasible. The very few studies addressing this method have either been limited by lack of independence between trapping rates and density estimations, or because they combined different species, thus introducing potential bias in camera trap detection rates. This study uses a single model species from several sites to analyse calibration of trapping rates to independently derived estimations of density. The study also makes the first field test of the method by Rowcliffe et al. (2008) for density derivation from camera trapping rates based on modelling animal-camera contacts. 2. We deployed camera traps along line transects at six sites in the Udzungwa Mountains of Tanzania and correlated trapping rates of Harvey's duiker Cephalophus harveyi with densities estimated from counts made along the same transects. 3. We found a strong, linear relationship (R(2) = 0.90) between trapping rate and density. Sampling precision analysis indicates that camera trapping rates reach satisfactory precision when trapping effort amounts to 250-300 camera days. Density estimates using Rowcliffe et al.'s (2008) gas model conversion are higher than from transect censuses; we discuss the possible reasons and stress the need for more field tests. 4. Synthesis and applications. Subject to rigorous and periodic calibration, and standardization of sampling procedures in time and over different sites, camera trapping rate is shown to be, in this study, a valid index of density in the target species. Comparative data indicate that this may also apply to forest ungulates in general. The method has great potential for standardizing monitoring programmes and reducing the costs of wildlife surveys, especially in remote areas.},

Counts of antelope tracks and dung piles were used to supplement information from areas where no direct observations were scored. This study provides the first account of the abundance of forest antelopes in the Udzungwa Mountains and confirms that methodological problems — such as poor antelope detectability due to understorey vegetation and difficulties in identifying antelope species — are inherent in estimations of forest antelope density by line transect counts. Combining counts of indirect signs with direct counts increases the information for some species and comparable data show that camera-trapping can also greatly supplement the information, especially for more elusive and/or more nocturnal species.},

  abstract = {We applied a dependent double-observer method for helicopter surveys and developed a hierarchical Bayesian model as a means to adjust counts of waterfowl for incomplete detection. We conducted our study using 52 plots in Labrador, Canada. A designated pair of primary observers reported counts and location of all waterfowl flocks that they detected to a pair of secondary observers, including details regarding the species, age and sex of observed birds. Secondary observers then reported any additional flocks observed by them but missed by the primary observers. The pairs of observers alternated between primary and secondary roles during the course of the survey, as well as position (front or back) within the helicopter. We used hierarchical Bayesian models to estimate detection probabilities of waterfowl flocks, as well as derive species-specific detection-corrected abundance and sex composition estimates of flocks. The hierarchical model output allowed us to derive estimates of indicated breeding pairs for each species in the survey area corrected for incomplete detection. Observers seated in the back of the helicopter had higher detection probabilities (0.89; 90\% Bayesian credible intervals [BCI] = 0.82-0.95) than those in the front (0.74; 90\% BCI = 0.66-0.83), and observer experience had a limited effect on detection. Total crew detection probabilities ranged between 0.99 (90\% BCI = 0.97-1.00) and 0.97(90\% BCI = 0.94-0.99), depending on the individual observers' position and role in the helicopter. Detection probabilities were higher for sea ducks and diving ducks and lower for dabbling ducks. Observers generally missed less than 5\% of the total indicated pairs for all species. We recommend that detection in helicopter surveys be measured to control for observer turnover, observer experience and aircraft-related differences in visibility.},

  abstract = {Site occupancy models have been developed that allow for imperfect species detection or “false negative” observations. Such models have become widely adopted in surveys of many taxa. The most fundamental assumption underlying these models is that “false positive” errors are not possible. That is, one cannot detect a species where it does not occur. However, such errors are possible in many sampling situations for a number of reasons, and even low false positive error rates can induce extreme bias in estimates of site occupancy when they are not accounted for. In this paper, we develop a model for site occupancy that allows for both false negative and false positive error rates. This model can be represented as a two-component finite mixture model and can be easily fitted using freely available software. We provide an analysis of avian survey data using the proposed model and present results of a brief simulation study evaluating the performance of the maximum-likelihood estimator and the naive estimator in the presence of false positive errors.},

  abstract = {Clusters or groups of individuals are the fundamental unit of observation in many wildlife sampling problems, including aerial surveys of waterfowl, marine mammals, and ungulates. Explicit accounting of cluster size in models for estimating abundance is necessary because detection of individuals within clusters is not independent and detectability of clusters is likely to increase with cluster size. This induces a cluster size bias in which the average cluster size in the sample is larger than in the population at large. Thus, failure to account for the relationship between delectability and cluster size will tend to yield a positive bias in estimates of abundance or density. I describe a hierarchical modeling framework for accounting for cluster-size bias in animal sampling. The hierarchical model consists of models for the observation process conditional on the cluster size distribution and the cluster size distribution conditional on the total number of clusters. Optionally, a spatial model can be specified that describes variation in the total number of clusters per sample unit. Parameter estimation, model selection, and criticism may be carried out using conventional likelihood-based methods. An extension of the model is described for the situation where measurable covariates at the level of the sample unit are available. Several candidate models within the proposed class are evaluated for aerial survey data on mallard ducks (Anas platyrhynchos).},

  abstract = {Many estimation and inference problems arising from large-scale animal surveys are focused on developing an understanding of patterns in abundance or occurrence of a species based on spatially referenced count data. One fundamental challenge, then, is that it is generally not feasible to completely enumerate (”census”) all individuals present in each sample unit. This observation bias may consist of several components, including spatial coverage bias (not all individuals in the Population are exposed to sampling) and detection bias (exposed individuals may go undetected). Thus, observations are biased for the state variable (abundance, occupancy) that is the object of inference. Moreover, data are often sparse for most observation locations, requiring consideration of methods for spatially aggregating or otherwise combining sparse data among sample units. The development of methods that unify spatial statistical models with models accommodating non-detection is necessary to resolve important spatial inference problems based on animal survey data. In this paper, we develop a novel hierarchical spatial model for estimation of abundance and occurrence from survey data wherein detection is imperfect. Our application is focused on spatial inference problems in the Swiss Survey of Common Breeding Birds. The observation model for the survey data is specified conditional on the unknown quadrat population size, N(s). We augment the observation model with a spatial process model for N(s), describing the spatial variation in abundance of the species. The model includes explicit sources of variation in habitat structure (forest, elevation) and latent variation in the form of a correlated spatial process. This provides a model-based framework for combining the spatially referenced samples while at the same time yielding a unified treatment of estimation problems involving both abundance and occurrence. We provide a Bayesian framework for analysis and prediction based on the integrated likelihood, and we use the model to obtain estimates of abundance and occurrence maps for the European Jay (Garrulus glandarius), a widespread, elusive, forest bird. The naive national abundance estimate ignoring imperfect detection and incomplete quadrat coverage was 77 766 territories. Accounting for imperfect detection added approximately 18000 territories, and adjusting for coverage bias added another 131 000 territories to yield a fully corrected estimate of the national total of about 227 000 territories. This is approximately three times as high as previous estimates that assume every territory is detected in each quadrat.},

  abstract = {Distance-sampling methods are commonly used in studies of animal populations to estimate population density. A common objective of such studies is to evaluate the relationship between abundance or density and covariates that describe animal habitat or other environmental influences. However, little attention has been focused on methods of modeling abundance covariate effects in conventional distance-sampling models. In this paper we propose a distance-sampling model that accommodates covariate effects on abundance. The model is based on specification of the distance-sampling likelihood at the level of the sample unit in terms of local abundance (for each sampling unit). This model is augmented with a Poisson regression model for local abundance that is parameterized in terms of available covariates. Maximum-likelihood estimation of detection and density parameters is based on the integrated likelihood, wherein local abundance is removed from the likelihood by integration. We provide an example using avian point-transect data of Ovenbirds (Seiurus aurocapillus) collected using a distance-sampling protocol and two measures of habitat structure (understory cover and basal area of overstory trees). The model yields a sensible description (positive effect of understory cover, negative effect on basal area) of the relationship between habitat and Ovenbird density that can be used to evaluate the effects of habitat management on Ovenbird populations.},

Such relationships may be described concisely using probability models that characterize variation in abundance of a species. However, estimation of the parameters of these models in most ecological problems is impaired by imperfect detection. When organisms are detected imperfectly, observed counts are biased estimates of true abundance, and this induces bias in stated occupancy or occurrence probability. In this paper we consider a class of models that enable estimation of abundance/occupancy relationships from counts of organisms that result from surveys in which detection is imperfect. Under such models, parameter estimation and inference are based on conventional likelihood methods. We provide an application of these models to geographically extensive breeding bird survey data in which alternative models of abundance are considered that include factors that influence variation in abundance and detectability. Using these models, we produce estimates of abundance and occupancy maps that honor important sources of spatial variation in avian abundance and provide clearly interpretable characterizations of abundance and occupancy adjusted for imperfect detection.},

  abstract = {Spatial replication is a common theme in count surveys of animals. Such surveys often generate sparse count data from which it is difficult to estimate population size while formally accounting for detection probability. In this article, I describe a class of models (N-mixture models) which allow for estimation of population size from such data. The key idea is to view site-specific population sizes, N, as independent random variables distributed according to some mixing distribution (e.g., Poisson). Prior parameters are estimated from the marginal likelihood of the data, having integrated over the prior distribution for N. Carroll and Lombard (1985, Journal of American Statistical Association 80, 423–426) proposed a class of estimators based on mixing over a prior distribution for detection probability. Their estimator can be applied in limited settings, but is sensitive to prior parameter values that are fixed a priori. Spatial replication provides additional information regarding the parameters of the prior distribution on N that is exploited by the N-mixture models and which leads to reasonable estimates of abundance from sparse data. A simulation study demonstrates superior operating characteristics (bias, confidence interval coverage) of the N-mixture estimator compared to the Caroll and Lombard estimator. Both estimators are applied to point count data on six species of birds illustrating the sensitivity to choice of prior on p and substantially different estimates of abundance as a consequence.},

  abstract = {1. Spatial capture–recapture models make use of auxiliary data on capture location to provide density estimates for animal populations. Previously, models have been developed primarily for fixed trap arrays which define the observable locations of individuals by a set of discrete points. 2. Here, we develop a class of models for ‘search-encounter’ data, i.e. for detections of recognizable individuals in continuous space, not restricted to trap locations. In our hierarchical model, detection probability is related to the average distance between individual location and the survey path. The locations are allowed to change over time owing to movements of individuals, and individual locations are related formally by a model describing individual activity or home range centre which is itself regarded as a latent variable in the model. We provide a Bayesian analysis of the model in WinBUGS, and develop a custom MCMC algorithm in the R language. 3. The model is applied to simulated data and to territory mapping data for the Willow Tit from the Swiss Breeding Bird Survey MHB. While the observed density was 15 territories per nominal 1 km2 plot of unknown effective sample area, the model produced a density estimate of 21·12 territories per square km (95\% posterior interval: 17–26). 4. Spatial capture–recapture models are relevant to virtually all animal population studies that seek to estimate population size or density, yet existing models have been proposed mainly for conventional sampling using arrays of traps. Our model for search-encounter data, where the spatial pattern of searching can be arbitrary and may change over occasions, greatly expands the scope and utility of spatial capture–recapture models.},

  abstract = {Substantial effort has been dedicated to developing reliable monitoring schemes for North American bird populations, but our ability to monitor bird populations in the boreal forest remains limited because of the sparsity of long-term data sets, particularly in northerly regions. Given the importance of the boreal forest for many migratory birds, we set out to (1) summarize the main challenges associated with monitoring avian populations, (2) describe the available statistical tools for population monitoring and their applications, and (3) identify future directions to overcome current challenges in monitoring bird populations in the boreal forest. Defining and delineating populations of interest and identifying the drivers that affect those populations present the greatest current challenges. This is because migratory birds may be affected by many population-limiting processes at different stages of their annual life cycles. These factors are often hierarchically structured and can influence populations at the local, regional, or continental scales. Some of the challenges associated with delineating populations and identifying population drivers can be addressed via the plethora of sampling and analytic methods available to examine population change over time. Choosing the proper analytic methods depends on the goals of the study and the nature of the data such as single or multiple populations, repeated occurrence or count-based surveys, or demographic rates. Recent advances in hierarchical and integrated population models make these analytic approaches some of the most promising avenues for the development of future methods. However, these tools require large data sets, and acquiring sufficient data on bird populations and potential explanatory variables is difficult in the boreal forest. If the current challenges to monitoring birds in the boreal forest are to be overcome, serious effort should be dedicated to integrating existing data and making them accessible. Enhancing survey effort through multispecies surveys will also play an important role. Implementing spatially balanced sampling plans with a rotating panel design could balance the trade-offs between spatial versus temporal replication at an affordable cost. Improving the accessibility of environmental covariates that are spatially and temporally explicit would also enable development of mechanistic population models that improve our understanding of migratory bird population dynamics. Finally, given that long-term monitoring programs can take many decades before delivering reliable population trends and that organizational priorities often change over time, we suggest that collaborative efforts will help ensure the long-term survival of new monitoring programs.},

A better understanding and description of how different levels of land use intensity affect biodiversity can support the planning and evaluation of policy measures. Objectives Our study investigates how land use-related landscape characteristics affect bird diversity, considering different spatial scales and species groups with characteristic habitat use. Methods We used breeding bird census data from 2693 observation points along 206 transects and applied a random effects hurdle model to describe the influence of the landscape characteristics altitude, forest proportion, patch density, land cover diversity, and land use intensity on avian species richness. Results Land use intensity and related landscape characteristics formed an important explanatory variable for bird richness. Increasing land use intensity was accompanied by a decrease in bird species richness. While forest bird richness decreased with a decreasing amount of forest cover, farmland species richness increased. This led to a bird diversity peak in extensively used semi-open landscapes. The influence of land cover diversity on species richness was small. Increasing patch density had positive effects on forest birds, but affected farm birds negatively. The strongest correlation between land use-based indicators and bird diversity was determined using spatial indicators at a close range around observation points (100-500 m radius). Conclusions Our results assist interpretation of the Pan-European Common Bird Indices and emphasize the importance of using multifaceted and thoroughly selected indicators in the context of biodiversity monitoring and decision-making support.},

Spotlight counts are most often used for this purpose. However, comparisons between regions or over years may be questionable when using encounter rates, i.e. the number of foxes seen per kilometre. We evaluated whether distance-sampling methods, which take account of variation in visibility, could be applied to spotlight counts of foxes along roads and trails. 2. Distance-sampling methods were used at 12 contrasting sites in France in a systematic design with equally spaced transects or points. Line and point transects were simultaneously applied at two sites to find the more precise and efficient method. 3. The number of foxes seen near the centreline was always low, although some foxes may have been missed. A peak of sightings at subsequent intervals from the centreline suggested evasive movements. 4. Despite the low sighting frequency near the centreline, which may reflect a violation of distance-sampling assumptions, a good model fit was obtained for eight out of 12 data sets using a regular 50-m grouping of the distance data. Increasing the first interval to account for evasive movement improved model fit in the four other data sets. Density estimates ranged from 0.39 to 3.54 foxes km(-2) (range of coefficient of variation 4.5-24.6\%). 5. Point and line transects resulted in similar density estimates, but point transects were more time consuming and resulted in larger coefficients of variation due to a smaller number of foxes seen by this method. Line transects may therefore produce better estimates of fox numbers. 6. There were few differences among the effective strip width estimates between the 12 sites (range 191-286 m), thus line transect estimates may have a limited advantage over encounter rates. 7. Synthesis and applications. The systematic scheme we applied in this study improved sampling design and variance estimations and should be useful for surveying terrestrial mammals with spotlight counts. However, the location of transects along roads and in open habitats probably induced biased results. Methodological improvements are necessary before spotlight distance sampling can become a routine monitoring tool for foxes.},

  abstract = {Legal removal of migratory birds from the wild occurs for several reasons, including subsistence, sport harvest, damage control, and the pet trade. We argue that harvest theory provides the basis for assessing the impact of authorized take, advance a simplified rendering of harvest theory known as potential biological removal as a useful starting point for assessing take, and demonstrate this approach with a case study of depredation control of black vultures (Coragyps atratus) in Virginia, USA. Based on data from the North American Breeding Bird Survey and other sources, we estimated that the black vulture population in Virginia was 91,190 (95\% credible interval = 44,520-212,100) in 2006. Using a simple population model and available estimates of life-history parameters, we estimated the intrinsic rate of growth (r(max)) to be in the range 7-14\%, with 10.6\% a plausible point estimate. For a take program to seek an equilibrium population size on the conservative side of the yield curve, the rate of take needs to be less than that which achieves a maximum sustained yield (0.5 X r(max)). Based on the point estimate for r(max) and using the lower 60\% credible interval for population size to account for uncertainty, these conditions would be met if the take of black vultures in Virginia in 2006 was,3,533 birds. Based on regular monitoring data, allowable harvest should be adjusted annually to reflect changes in population size. To initiate discussion about how this assessment framework could be related to the laws and regulations that govern authorization of such take, we suggest that the Migratory Bird Treaty Act requires only that take of native migratory birds be sustainable in the long-term, that is, sustained harvest rate should be ¡ r(max). Further, the ratio of desired harvest rate to 0.5 X r(max) may be a useful metric for ascertaining the applicability of specific requirements of the National Environmental Protection Act.

  abstract = {We collaboratively designed and implemented a pilot study to evaluate improved methods for estimating the distribution and abundance of prairie grouse in South Dakota and North Dakota. Current prairie grouse population monitoring in both states relies on annual surveys of male birds on leks within designated survey blocks. Although the survey results may give insight into local populations, they have limited utility in estimating statewide abundances or trends because survey blocks are often non-random, biased toward high quality habitat, and lack adequate spatial coverage. To improve upon current methods, we surveyed male prairie grouse on 865 randomly selected Public Land Survey Sections from 2010-2016, then developed habitat-based spatially explicit occurrence and density models, which we then applied to the universe of environmental predictors to create spatial maps. Our results were consistent with prairie grouse biology, showing strong selection for grasslands and avoidance of developed areas. We demonstrate how our approach provides several avenues to estimate relative abundance of males with confidence limits, along with suggestions to improve estimates. In addition to providing insight into broad-scale habitat selection, spatially explicit habitat models can be valuable tools for identifying and prioritizing areas for conservation treatments such as protection, restoration, or enhancement of habitat. We provide recommendations for future data collection and application of conservation treatments to improve prairie grouse population monitoring and conservation delivery across large landscapes.

Competing models of detection probability in Program MARK indicated that nest-detection probability differed by nest stage. We found no evidence to indicate that detection rates of nests were associated with survey timing during the nesting season. Raw nest counts in burned coniferous forests may underestimate nest numbers, especially for nests in early stages of development. Black-backed Woodpecker nests were slightly more detectable than those of Hairy Woodpeckers in burned forests, and observers may differ in their abilities to detect nests. Received 12 February 2008.

We considered that at each sampling occasion, individuals in a population could be detected at 1 of the survey sites or remain undetected and used either multinomial or binomial simultaneous-count models to estimate abundance, the latter being equivalent to an N-mixture model with one site. We tested model performance with simulations over a range of detection probabilities, population sizes, growth rates, number of years, sampling occasions, and sites. We then applied our method to 3 critically endangered vulture species in Cambodia to demonstrate the real-world applicability of the model and to provide the first abundance estimates for these species in Cambodia. Our new approach works best when existing methods are expected to perform poorly (i.e., few sites and large variation in abundance among sites) and if individuals may move among sites between sampling occasions. The approach performed better when there were ¿8 sampling occasions and net probability of detection was high (¿0.5). We believe our approach will be useful in particular for simultaneous surveys at aggregation sites, such as roosts. The method complements existing approaches for estimating abundance of unmarked individuals and is the first method designed specifically for simultaneous counts.},

We analyzed data from 77 forest stands that varied in size from 16 to 213 ha. Canonical correlation analysis (CANCOR) indicated that stand-level features accounted for more variance in the relative abundance of bird species than did landscape-level features (35 versus 14\%, respectively). The most important stand-level features were overstory canopy cover, density of large-diameter live trees, and understory structure (especially herbs and shrubs). Important landscape features for predicting the abundance of species within a forest stand included stand isolation and the percentage of surrounding landscape within a 4-km radius that was occupied by forest cover. Using the information-theoretic approach to model selection and inference, we built models of bird-habitat relationships to forecast abundance of 24 species. Consistent with CANCOR results, species-specific habitat models were dominated by stand-level variables. Overstory cover was a significant predictor of abundance for 17 of 24 species modeled (71\%). We conclude that in forests represented by our sample, management for most avian species can be usefully focused on within-stand dynamics of structure, but that efforts to forecast abundance of some species can be enhanced by integration of landscape metrics as well.},

  abstract = {We aimed to determine optimal methods of underwater visual census (UVC) for estimating the abundance of coral reef fishes exploited by fisheries in the tropical Pacific. Two main methods were tested using SCUBA: strip transect and stationary point counts. We assessed their relative accuracy, precision, power and efficiency (cost), and compared different census area dimensions, observer swimming speeds, and number of replicates. Twenty-five comparisons of the two UVC methods were conducted for 73 species from five families of coral reef fishes, on reefs in Australia and Fiji. Species were grouped within families based on their mobility. Few significant differences were found, either among or between strip transects and stationary point counts. The data were characterised by high variability, low precision and low power. A trend for greater accuracy in density estimates of small sedentary species with smaller census area was apparent, which probably reflects searching efficiency. Only one species group, the sedentary Acanthuridae showed differences between transects and point counts. Higher, hence presumably more accurate, density estimates were obtained with 50 m x 5 m transects. Notably, point counts could be deployed in similar to 70\% of the time of transects. A bootstrapping procedure demonstrated a consistent improvement in precision of density estimates with increasing number of replicates, but no appreciable change in precision was found beyond 10 to 15 replicates, in all species groups and for both transects and point counts. Consequently, and because of the high variability inherent in fish density estimates, we recommend that at least 10 replicates be used to quantify the species considered here. The power calculations showed that only large differences in density will be detected with the replication levels typical of UVC surveys. Power was greatest for the roving serranids, with a decrease in density of about 50\% detectable for this species group. We discuss the importance of carefully defining the behavioural attributes of species prior to selecting a UVC method. A method of temporal stratification in a count is described for censusing a range of species of varying mobilities. We suggest that fish mobility and search efficiency are key factors in optimising UVC methods.},

  abstract = {1. Many monitoring programmes are successful at monitoring common species, whereas rare species, which are often of highest conservation concern, may be detected infrequently. Study designs that increase the probability of detecting rare species at least once over the study period, while collecting adequate data on common species, strengthen programme ability to address community-wide hypotheses about how an ecosystem functions or responds to management actions. Study design guidelines exist for single-species occupancy models, but practical guidance for monitoring species communities is needed. Single-species population-level designs are necessarily optimal for targeted species, whereas community study designs may be optimal for the assemblage of species, but not for every species within the community. Our objective was to provide a general optimization tool for multi-species models and to illustrate this tool using data from two avian community studies. 2. We conducted a simulation study with a Bayesian hierarchical model to explore design and cost trade-offs for avian community monitoring programmes. We parameterized models using two long-term avian studies from Arizona, USA and evaluated bias and accuracy for different combinations of species in the regional species pool and sampling design combinations of number of sites and sampling occasions. We optimized for maximum accuracy of species richness, detection probability and occupancy probability of rare species, given a fixed budget. 3. Statistical properties for species richness and detection probability of species within the community were driven more by sampling occasions, whereas rare species occupancy probability was influenced more by percentage of area sampled. These results are consistent with results from single-species models, suggesting some similarities between community-level and single-species models with occupancy and detection. 4. Synthesis and applications. Study designs must be cost-efficient while providing reliable knowledge. Researchers and managers have limited funds for collecting data. Our template can be used by researchers and managers to evaluate trade-offs and efficiencies for allocating samples between the number of occasions and sites in multi-species studies, and allow them to identify the optimal study design in order to achieve specific study objectives.},

  abstract = {Tropical dry forests (TDF) are subject to intense human intervention leading to an increase of secondary forests and changes in habitat suitability for birds. Despite the increasing research on secondary forests, we have little understanding of how such changes in tropical dry forests have affected animal communities. The main goal of this research was to investigate the influence of successional age, vegetation structure, and landscape characteristics on tropical bird species or functional groups (i.e. feeding guilds, forest-dependent birds, and individual species of conservation interest) in a TDF. Specifically, we addressed the following questions for both the breeding season and for the non-breeding season: (1) do different successional stages (age) support different levels of total bird species richness and of species richness of different feeding guilds and the group of forest-dependent bird species; (2) does the relative abundance of individual bird species of conservation interest differ across successional stages, and, (3) what is the relative contribution of succession age, vegetation physical structure, and configuration of landscape elements on the species richness of various feeding guilds and the group of forest-dependent birds, and on the relative abundance of individual species of conservation interest? We used a stratified sampling design based on 274 sites that varied according to successional stages over an area of 352 km(2) in Yucatan, Mexico to assess bird numbers during 2008 and 2009 using the double-observer method. We used a SPOT5 imagery (2005) to produce a land cover map in which the vegetation classes represented different stages of forest succession as well as topographic position. From the land cover map several landscape metrics were calculated and used to relate bird species richness in the different feeding guilds, as well as the relative abundance of the individual species of conservation interest, with landscape structure. We detected 103 species of birds, which were assigned to one of nine feeding guilds and forest-dependent group. Bird species richness was often similar across the successional gradient with guilds changing across the gradient. Specifically, forest age was associated with an increase in species richness of guilds vulnerable to habitat modification and forest-dependent species. Our findings indicate that large, preferably interconnected, patches of older successional forest could aid bird conservation in TDF.},

  abstract = {Attalea palms provide primary habitat to Rhodnius spp., vectors of Trypanosoma cruzi. Flying from palms, these blood-sucking bugs often invade houses and can infect people directly or via food contamination. Chagas disease (CD) risk may therefore increase when Attalea palms thrive near houses. For example, Attalea dominate many deforested landscapes of eastern Amazonia, where acute-CD outbreaks are disturbingly frequent. Despite this possible link between deforestation and CD risk, the population-level responses of Amazonian Attalea and their resident Rhodnius to anthropogenic landscape disturbance remain largely uncharted. We studied adult Attalea palms in old-growth forest (OGF), young secondary forest (YSF), and cattle pasture (CP) in two localities of eastern Amazonia. We recorded 1856 Attalea along 10 transects (153.6 ha), and detected infestation by Rhodnius spp. in 18 of 280 systematically-sampled palms (33 bugs caught). Distance-sampling models suggest that, relative to OGF, adult Attalea density declined by 70–80\% in CP and then recovered in YSF. Site-occupancy models estimate a strong positive effect of deforestation on palm-infestation odds (βCP-infestation = 4.82±1.14 SE), with a moderate decline in recovering YSF (βYSF-infestation = 2.66±1.10 SE). Similarly, N-mixture models suggest that, relative to OGF, mean vector density sharply increased in CP palms (βCP-density = 3.20±0.62 SE) and then tapered in YSF (βYSF-density = 1.61±0.76 SE). Together, these results indicate that disturbed landscapes may support between \textasciitilde 2.5 (YSF) and \textasciitilde 5.1 (CP) times more Attalea-dwelling Rhodnius spp. per unit area than OGF. We provide evidence that deforestation may favor palm-dwelling CD vectors in eastern Amazonia. Importantly, our landscape-disturbance effect estimates explicitly take account of (i) imperfect palm and bug detection and (ii) the uncertainties about infestation and vector density arising from sparse bug data. These results suggest that incorporating landscape-disturbance metrics into the spatial stratification of transmission risk could help enhance CD surveillance and prevention in Amazonia.},

  abstract = {Although considerable effort has been made to identify the appropriate climatic conditions for bird surveys, considered as standard conditions, in many occasions these conditions are not fulfilled. These are for instance the case of environmental impact assessments (EIA), where the field work is, recurrently, carried out in variable and non-standard weather conditions or in the scope of general ecological monitoring (GEM) programs, where different taxa (birds and other animal groups) are sampled simultaneously with district methodological requirements. The present work examined the applicability of a stochastic dynamic methodology (StDM) for predicting the richness and diversity of passerine surveys in mountain habitats characterized by variable and, predominantly, non-standard weather conditions. The relative variations of these metrics are the underlying database of our StDM model, providing some basis to analyse the accuracy of bird surveys. This model focuses on the interactions between conceptually isolated key-components, such as the passerine richness and diversity, and the influence of the prevailing climatic conditions. The proposed model was preceded by a conventional multivariate statistical procedure performed to discriminate the significant relationships between the selected metrics versus climatic variables. Since this statistical analysis is static, the dataset recorded from the field included true gradients of weather conditions (ranging from standard to extreme conditions). The results of the StDM simulations revealed significant variations in the performance of passerine surveys in response to several combinations of non-standard weather conditions, which enable us to calculate the appropriated correction factors for discrete climatic scenarios. This could be used, in the future, to improve the quality of passerine diversity and richness estimates, namely in the scope of EIA studies when the climatic conditions are inevitably adverse for rigorous passerine surveys.

  abstract = {Analysis of North American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) data requires controls for factors that influence detectability of birds along survey routes. Identifying factors that influence the counting process and incorporating them into analyses is a primary means of limiting bias in estimates of population change. Twedt (2015) implemented an alternative counting protocol on operational and nonrandom BBS survey routes in the southeastern United States. Observers on selected routes employed a time-distance protocol in which they recorded birds in 1-min intervals and in 2 distance categories. We hypothesized that processing and recording observations using this time-distance protocol could cause observers to count fewer birds relative to observers using the standard protocol. We used a hierarchical log-linear model with a categorical covariate associated with protocol (standard vs. time-distance) to assess whether use of the time-distance protocol had a measurable effect on counting birds along BBS routes. We applied this model to BBS data from portions of 8 states in which the time-distance protocol was implemented and estimated a protocol effect for 167 bird species. We documented a significant overall effect of the time-distance protocol on observers'counts of birds. On average, the effect of the time-distance protocol was a 10\% decline in counted birds; 80\% of species had lower counts when the time-distance protocol was used on a survey route. However, because the time-distance protocol was only used on a small portion of the operational BBS routes and for a limited time, including the covariate for the time-distance protocol data had insignificant effects on analysis of population change. Although the covariate controlled for the effects of the time-distance protocol in BBS data, the results emphasize the importance of standardization as well as a need to track and, if necessary, control in analyses for changes in counting procedures along BBS routes.},

We evaluated the use of the North American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) to meet information needs for conservation planning in Bird Conservation Regions (BCRs). The BBS originally was developed to provide regional estimates for states, provinces, physiographic regions, and larger areas. Many analyses have used physiographic regions within states/provinces as strata. We evaluated potential consequences of using BCRs instead of the BBS physiographic regions, testing for spatial differences in sample intensity within states and provinces. We reclassified the BBS survey routes to BCRs and conducted route regression trend (interval-specific population change) analyses for a variety of regions and time intervals. Our results were similar to those based on traditional BBS regions and suggest minimal consequences of the reclassification for the BBS sample. We summarized population change within BCRs and assessed the efficiency of the BBS in estimating population change for 421 species surveyed. As would be expected from an omnibus survey, many species appeared to be poorly monitored by the BBS, with 42\% of species encountered at {$<$}1 bird per route from the survey, and 28\% of trend estimates too imprecise to detect a 3\% per year change over 35 years. Our results indicated that the quality of the survey for estimation of population change varied among BCRs. Population trends of species were heterogeneous over space and time, varying among BCRs for 76\% of species and over time for 39\% of species. Regional heterogeneity also existed in trends of species groups from the BBS. While 49\% of all species in the survey had increasing populations, grassland breeding birds showed consistent declines, with only 18\% of species having positive trend estimates. Bird Conservation Regions appear to provide reasonable strata for summary of BBS data.},

  abstract = {Abstract: Without robust and unbiased systems for monitoring, changes in natural systems will remain enigmatic for policy makers, leaving them without a clear idea of the consequences of any environmental policies they might adopt. Generally, biodiversity-monitoring activities are not integrated or evaluated across any large geographic region. The EuMon project conducted the first large-scale evaluation of monitoring practices in Europe through an on-line questionnaire and is reporting on the results of this survey. In September 2007 the EuMon project had documented 395 monitoring schemes for species, which represents a total annual cost of about €4 million, involving more than 46,000 persons devoting over 148,000 person-days/year to biodiversity-monitoring activities. Here we focused on the analysis of variations of monitoring practices across a set of taxonomic groups (birds, amphibians and reptiles, mammals, butterflies, plants, and other insects) and across 5 European countries (France, Germany, Hungary, Lithuania, and Poland). Our results suggest that the overall sampling effort of a scheme is linked with the proportion of volunteers involved in that scheme. Because precision is a function of the number of monitored sites and the number of sites is maximized by volunteer involvement, our results do not support the common belief that volunteer-based schemes are too noisy to be informative. Just the opposite, we believe volunteer-based schemes provide relatively reliable data, with state-of-the-art survey designs or data-analysis methods, and consequently can yield unbiased results. Quality of data collected by volunteers is more likely determined by survey design, analytical methodology, and communication skills within the schemes rather than by volunteer involvement per se.},

  abstract = {A primary objective of ecological monitoring programs typically includes the efficient detection of population trends. Passerines as a group are important ecological indicators and are often included in such programs to provide information on multiple species with a single survey technique. However, commonly used field and analytical approaches may not provide appropriate inference or sensitivity due to assumption violations and differences in the proportion of the population exposed to sampling. Recent methodological developments utilizing repeated point counts and an N-mixture modeling approach for analysis may produce more consistent and interpretable estimates applicable to the superpopulation of individuals using a site during the breeding season. These estimates should be more useful for monitoring because they are not conditioned on presence or availability as are most single-visit approaches. We used repeated count data collected in Denali National Park and Preserve, Alaska (Denali) between 1995 and 2009 from 12 common passerine species to assess variation in presence and availability throughout the season, estimate trends in superpopulation abundance, and provide recommendations for the design of future monitoring programs. We found that variation in detection due to presence and availability was large and differed among species. After accounting for these sources of variation, we estimated abundance of Wilson's warblers (Wilsonia pusilla) had declined by approximately 48\% and fox sparrow (Passerella iliaca) abundance had increased by approximately 250\% over 15 years. Combined, our results suggest that if trend estimation is a priority, passerine monitoring programs should formally address all components of the detection process, including the probabilities of presence and availability.

  abstract = {Wildlife population estimators often require formal adjustment for imperfect detection of individuals during surveys. Conventional distance sampling (CDS) and its extensions (mark-recapture distance sampling [MRDS], temporary emigration distance sampling [TEDS]) are popular approaches for producing unbiased estimators of wildlife abundance. However, despite extensive discussion and development of distance sampling theory in the literature, deciding which of these alternatives is most appropriate for a particular scenario can be confusing. Some of this confusion may stem from an incomplete understanding of how each approach addresses the components of the detection process. Here we describe the proper application of CDS, MRDS, and TEDS approaches and use applied examples to help clarify their differing assumptions with respect to the components of the detection process. To further aid the practitioner, we summarize the differences in a decision tree that can be used to identify cases where a more complex alternative (e.g., MRDS or TEDS) may be appropriate for a given survey application. Although the more complex approaches can account for additional sources of bias, in practical applications one also must consider estimator precision. Therefore, we also review the concept of total estimator error in the context of comparing competing methods for a given application to aid in the selection of the most appropriate distance sampling approach. Finally, we detail how the use of more advanced techniques (i.e., informed priors, open-population distance sampling models, and integrated modeling approaches) can further reduce total estimator error by leveraging information from existing and ongoing data collection. By synthesizing the existing literature on CDS, MRDS, TEDS and their extensions, in conjunction with the concepts of total estimator error and the components of the detection process, we provide a comprehensive guide that can be used by the practitioner to more efficiently, effectively, and appropriately apply distance sampling in a variety of settings.},

  abstract = {Obtaining useful estimates of wildlife abundance or density requires thoughtful attention to potential sources of bias and precision, and it is widely understood that addressing incomplete detection is critical to appropriate inference. When the underlying assumptions of sampling approaches are violated, both increased bias and reduced precision of the population estimator may result. Bear (Ursus spp.) populations can be difficult to sample and are often monitored using mark-recapture distance sampling (MRDS) methods, although obtaining adequate sample sizes can be cost prohibitive. With the goal of improving inference, we examined the underlying methodological assumptions and estimator efficiency of three datasets collected under an MRDS protocol designed specifically for bears. We analyzed these data using MRDS, conventional distance sampling (CDS), and open-distance sampling approaches to evaluate the apparent bias-precision tradeoff relative to the assumptions inherent under each approach. We also evaluated the incorporation of informative priors on detection parameters within a Bayesian context. We found that the CDS estimator had low apparent bias and was more efficient than the more complex MRDS estimator. When combined with informative priors on the detection process, precision was increased by {$>$} 50\% compared to the MRDS approach with little apparent bias. In addition, open-distance sampling models revealed a serious violation of the assumption that all bears were available to be sampled. Inference is directly related to the underlying assumptions of the survey design and the analytical tools employed. We show that for aerial surveys of bears, avoidance of unnecessary model complexity, use of prior information, and the application of open population models can be used to greatly improve estimator performance and simplify field protocols. Although we focused on distance sampling-based aerial surveys for bears, the general concepts we addressed apply to a variety of wildlife survey contexts.},

  abstract = {Managers rely on accurate estimators of wildlife abundance and trends for management decisions. Despite the focus of contemporary wildlife science on developing methods to improve inference from wildlife surveys, legacy datasets often rely on index counts that lack information about the detection process. Data integration can be a useful tool for combining index counts with data collected under more rigorous designs (i.e., designs that account for the detection process), but care is required when datasets represent different population processes or are mismatched in space and time. This can be particularly problematic in cases where animals aggregate in response to a spatially or temporally limited resource because individuals may temporarily immigrate from outside the study area and be included in the abundance index. Abundance indices based on brown bear (Ursus arctos) feeding aggregations within coastal meadows in early summer in Lake Clark National Park and Preserve, Alaska, USA, are one such example. These indices reflect the target population (brown bears residing within the park) and temporary immigrants (i.e., bears drawn from outside the park boundary). To properly account for the effects of temporary immigration, we integrated the index data with abundance data collected via park-wide distance sampling surveys, the latter of which properly addressed the detection process. By assuming that the distance data provide inference on abundance and the index counts represent some combination of abundance and temporary immigration processes, we were able to decompose the relative contribution of each to overall trend. We estimated that the density of brown bears within our study area was 38–54 adults/1,000 km2 during 2003–2019 and that abundance increased at a rate of approximately 1.4\%/year. The contribution of temporary immigrants to overall trend in the index was low, so we created 3 hypothetical scenarios to more fully demonstrate how the integrated approach could be useful in situations where the composite trend in meadow counts may obscure trends in abundance (e.g., opposing trends in abundance and temporary immigration). Our work represents a conceptual advance supporting the integration of legacy index data with more rigorous data streams and is broadly applicable in cases where trends in index values may represent a mixture of population processes.},

  abstract = {Minimum counts are commonly used to estimate population size and trend for wildlife conservation and management; however, the scope of inference based on such data is limited by untestable assumptions regarding the detection process. Alternative approaches, such as distance sampling, occupancy surveys, and repeated counts, can be employed to produce detection-corrected estimates of population parameters. Unfortunately, these approaches can be more complicated and costly to implement, potentially limiting their use. We explored a conceptual framework linking datasets collected at different spatial scales under different survey designs, with the goal of improving inference. Specifically, we link landscape-scale distance sampling surveys with local-scale minimum counts in an integrated modeling framework to estimate mountain goat (Oreamnos americanus) abundance at both the local and regional scale in south-central Alaska, USA, and provide an estimate of detection probability (i.e., sightability) for the minimum counts. Estimated sightability for the minimum count surveys was 0.67 (95\% credible interval [CrI] = 0.52-0.83) and abundance for the entire area was 5,600 goats (CV = 9\%), both in broad agreement with estimates from previous studies. Abundance estimates at the local scale (i.e., individual min. count unit) were reasonably precise (CV \& x305; = 18\%), suggesting the integrated approach can increase the amount of information produced at both spatial scales by linking minimum count approaches with more rigorous survey designs. We propose that our integrated approach may be implemented in the context of a modified split-panel monitoring design by altering survey protocols to include frequent minimum counts within local count units and intermittent but more rigorous survey designs with inference to the entire study area or population of interest. Doing so would provide estimates of abundance with appropriate measures of uncertainty at multiple spatial scales, thereby improving inference for population monitoring and management.

  abstract = {1. Effective wildlife management and conservation depends on a detailed understanding of population dynamics at large spatial scales. Distance sampling is an efficient tool for landscape-scale monitoring, and the recent development of the open-population distance sampling framework for analysis allows efficient estimation of population parameters for unmarked populations. 2. Applications of open-population distance approaches are relatively rare, and further development is required to generalize this powerful class of models for use in complex sampling scenarios. 3. Here, we extend this class of models to situations where individuals occur in groups and address: the incorporation of group composition information, fluctuations in aggregation among individuals into groups, and non-repeated survey designs. We also describe a new parameter, kappa, representing the change in the rate of aggregation of individuals into groups over time. Using simulations, we assess the performance of this extended framework, and demonstrate its utility through an applied example using a Dall's sheep (Ovis dalli dalli) dataset collected in Alaska from 2009 to 2016. 4. Our simulation study demonstrated that our extended model reliably recovered the data-generating parameter values without bias. In the applied example, we found that an abrupt decline in abundance observed in the Dall's sheep population was driven primarily by reductions in lambs and ewe-like sheep that coincided with the late onset of spring conditions in 2013. Rams were much less affected, suggesting declines in the ewe-like class drove overall population trajectory in this population. 5. This work demonstrates how ecological questions related to the dynamics of group-dwelling species may be assessed in complex sampling situations using an open-population distance sampling framework. The resulting framework is broadly applicable to a variety of species and will be especially useful for evaluating population dynamics in unmarked populations of group-dwelling species at large spatial scales.},

  abstract = {Management of large mammal populations has often been based on aerial minimum count surveys that are uncorrected for incomplete detection and lack estimates of precision. These limitations can be particularly problematic for Dall's sheep (Ovis dalli dalli) due to the high cost of surveys and variation in detection probability across time and space. The limitations of these methods have been recognized for some time, but previously proposed alternatives for sheep surveys proved to be too costly and logistically unfeasible in most circumstances (Udevitz et al. 2006). We assessed the potential for a combination of distance sampling surveys and a hierarchical modeling approach to provide a more efficient means for estimating Dall's sheep abundance by conducting aerial contour transect surveys over all sheep habitat in Gates of the Arctic National Park and Preserve (GAAR), Alaska in 2009 and 2010. We estimated the population of Dall's sheep was 8,412 (95\% CI: 6,51711,090) and 10,072 (95\% CI 8,08112,520) in 2009 and 2010, respectively. Abundance within the Itkillik Preserve area within GAAR was 1,898 (95\% CI: 1,4212,578) and 1,854 (95\% CI: 1,3422,488) in 2009 and 2010, respectively. Estimates of lamb abundance in 2010 were more than double those of 2009 after correcting for detection bias related to group size, suggesting that the apparent estimate of lambs in the population may be biased in some years depending on the degree of aggregation. Overall, the contour transect surveys were feasible logistically, cost 7080\% less than minimum count surveys, and produced precise estimates of abundance, indicating that the application of these methods could be used effectively to increase the statistical rigor and spatial extent of Dall's sheep abundance surveys throughout Alaska. These methods could be used to improve the assessment of long-term trends in populations and productivity and provide valuable information for harvest management at both local and landscape scales at reduced costs in comparison to traditional minimum count surveys.

However, randomized design recommendations are not always followed or may be impractical to implement for some survey types, particularly in cases where transects must be placed perpendicular to the habitat gradient. Full-likelihood spatial distance sampling models provide a potential solution to violations of the design assumption by jointly modelling the detection and occurrence processes using spatially indexed habitat covariates. Through simulation and an applied example based on a survey for Dall's sheep in Alaska, USA, we used a full-likelihood distance sampling approach to investigate the potential for bias in cases where transects placed perpendicular to the habitat gradient (e.g. elevational contours) are non-randomly sampled. We also assessed the utility of spatial approaches in cases where transects are placed along linear features, such as roads or ridgelines, where habitat may be unrepresentative of the overall study area. Our results showed that the full-likelihood approach was generally unbiased, even in extreme scenarios where habitat was inversely related to distance from the transect. For the Dall's sheep example, our results showed that more efficient designs with reduced sampling effort in low-quality habitats are a practical solution for reducing logistical costs when the data are analysed in a spatial modelling framework. Together, our findings confirm and extend existing work suggesting that spatial distance sampling can be a useful solution when non-random designs are employed. Given the high cost of survey implementation in many cases, the development of valid alternatives to design-based inference will aid in the amount of information available for a variety of species. The results of our work will be useful for practitioners in assessing alternative designs relative to particular survey applications.},

  abstract = {Understanding habitat requirements is vital for developing successful management strategies for threatened species. In this study we analyse the habitat selection of two globally threatened waterbirds (Marbled Teal Marmaronetta angustirostris and White-headed Duck Oxyura leucocephala) coexisting in an internationally important wetland (El Hondo Natural Park, south-eastern Spain) at three spatial scales. We surveyed adults and broods of these species fortnightly during two consecutive years and we related density and presence of birds to several habitat variables. At a pond-selection scale, the density of both species was related to the surface area of the ponds, with Marbled Teal showing avoidance of medium-sized ponds, andWhite-headed Ducks strong selection for the largest ponds. Within ponds, Marbled Teal avoided open waters, and was mainly associated with Phragmites reedbeds, but also selected areas with saltmarsh and Scirpus vegetation, especially for brood-rearing. White-headed Duck made more use of deeper areas with open water, especially in winter, and Phragmites was the only emergent vegetation with which it associated. When breeding success was very high in 2000, strong creching of broods was observed in White-headed Duck, but not in Marbled Teal. In order to provide suitable habitat for both species, there is a need to maintain spatial diversity with a combination of large wetlands suitable for both species and small, vegetated ones suitable for the Marbled Teal.},

Each oasis was visited at the beginning of the breeding season and two months later, which allowed us to conduct counts on five points per oasis per visit. For each oasis, we considered the observed species number as the total number of species recorded during each visit, and we used a capture-recapture approach to estimate species number from patterns of presence and absence of species over the five points. We found that birds were more detectable at the beginning of the breeding season than two months later, and the observed species number showed a significant decrease between the two periods. However, when a capture-recapture approach accounting for heterogeneity in species detectability was used, similar estimates were obtained from data collected during both periods. Nonetheless, the estimates obtained at the beginning of the breeding season were more precise than those obtained later. Overall, our results illustrate once more the need of taking into account time of season as an important source of bias when attempting to determine species richness from count data, and stress the need for using probabilistic approaches in such an investigation.},

  abstract = {Rigorous monitoring of Earth's terrestrial surface requires mapping estimates of land cover and of their errors in space and time. Estimation of error in land-cover change detection currently relies heavily on external, post hoc validation—i.e., comparison of estimated cover to independent values that are assumed to be true. However, reference data are themselves uncertain, and acquiring observations coincident with historical data is often impossible. Complementarily, modeling the transmission, or propagation, of error through the processes of classification and change detection provides an internal means to estimate classification and change-detection error at the scale of pixels. Modeling uncertainty around the estimate of fractional, “continuous-field” cover as a standard Normal distribution in each pixel at each of two times, we derive a method for propagating this uncertainty to categorical land cover-classification and change detection. We demonstrate the approach for mapping forest-cover change and its uncertainty based on bi-temporal estimates of percent-tree cover and their associated root-mean-square errors (RMSE). The method described here propagates only the imprecision component of error and not bias, so neither the resulting categorical estimates of cover nor the detection of change (e.g., forest loss) are affected by the transmission of uncertainty. However, propagating the RMSE of input estimates into probabilities of forest cover and change enables mapping and visualization of the spatial distribution of the imprecision resulting from model-based estimation of tree cover and from selection of the threshold of tree cover to define “forest”. When compared to reference data with a fixed definition of forest (e.g., ≥30\% tree cover) the threshold effect is an importance source of apparent error in forest-cover and -change estimates. The approach described here provides a useful description of classification and change-detection certainty and can accommodate any definition of forest based on tree cover—an especially important consideration given the variety of institutional definitions of forest cover based on remotely sensible structural characteristics.},

However, uncertainty remains about how the size and shape of habitat patches and the surrounding habitat matrix affect patch occupancy by shrubland passerines. Our objectives were to determine if shrubland birds avoid small or irregularly shaped habitat patches and to identify minimum area requirements for area-sensitive species. Additionally, we sought to determine if the proportion of mature forest cover in the landscape influences patch occupancy. We surveyed 35 individual habitat patches in 2007 and 43 in 2008 for the presence of eight shrubland birds. Then, we modeled the probability of five of these species occupying an individual patch relative to patch area, patch shape, and percent forest cover within 1 km of the patch. We documented evidence of area sensitivity for the Yellow-breasted Chat (Icteria virens) and Prairie Warbler (Setophaga discolor) and estimated their minimum area requirements at 2.3 and 1.1 ha, respectively. The Blue Grosbeak (Passerina caerulea) also was area-sensitive in irregularly shaped patches. Predicted patch-occupancy probability was ¿0.9 in patches ¿= 5.5 ha for all area-sensitive species. Patch shape alone and proportion of forest cover were not important predictors of occupancy for these shrubland birds. Restored shrubland and early-successional forest in agricultural landscapes can provide habitat for many shrubland birds, but patches should be ¿5 ha to maximize shrubland bird diversity.},

  abstract = {Few studies have explored annual reproductive effort of fish populations, yet factors such as skipped spawning could influence recruitment processes. We estimated the number of broods produced annually as an index of reproductive effort for Florida Bass Micropterus floridanus across four lakes in north-central Florida. Snorkel surveys were used to estimate reproductive effort in the lakes from 2010 to 2012. Mark-recapture methods were used to estimate the abundance of Florida Bass in each lake during each year. All four lakes contained high-density Florida Bass populations that showed evidence of relatively slow growth. Average relative weight in all populations was low, ranging from 65.4 to 68.8 for adults (25.0cm TL). Annual reproductive effort (estimated number of broods) varied among lakes and across years. We found evidence for multiple spawning events per adult and for skipped spawning. Devils Hole Lake produced the highest number of broods in all 3years, ranging from 1.62 broods/spawner in 2012 to 3.72 broods/spawner in 2011 (median = 3.24 broods/spawner in 2010). All other populations exhibited skipped spawning, with the proportion of nonreproductive adults varying across years. Picnic Lake fish had the lowest number of broods overall (only 0.02 broods/spawner in 2011 and 0.01 broods/spawner in 2012). The other two lakes showed variable levels of spawning effort. Spawner abundance in these populations was not related to the estimated annual number of broods, contrary to the general assumption made for many population models. Variability in annual reproductive effort may be more common than anticipated, potentially clouding the relationship between spawner abundance and recruitment. Estimation of annual reproductive effort may provide insight into density-dependent population regulation and recruitment processes. Received February 14, 2013; accepted July 22, 2013},

  abstract = {Fish populations that undergo heavy exploitation and those for which the act of fishing can influence individual brood success are at risk of recruitment effects due to angling. The angling of brood-guarding male black bass Micropterus spp. has been shown to decrease brood success, although there is no evidence that a loss of individual broods has population-level impacts. Therefore, some level of recruitment compensation may influence juvenile bass survival. We sought to measure recruitment compensation and the form of the stock-recruit relationship for a brood-guarding species, the Florida Largemouth Bass M. salmoides floridanus ( hereafter, Florida Bass). The study was conducted in four north-central Florida lakes during 4 years ( 2010-2013). We quantified adult stock density by using mark-recapture electrofishing surveys. The estimated broods produced in each spawning season, the number of those broods that were successful, and the age-1 recruit density were quantified via snorkel surveys. We evaluated three models for describing the effects of stock density or successful brood density on recruitment: a proportional ( linear; i.e., no compensation) model, a Ricker ( dome-shaped) model, and a Beverton-Holt ( asymptotic) model. Recruit density was better indicated by the number of successful broods produced than by spawning stock density. Model comparisons indicated that the density-dependent models had the most support, whereas there was no apparent support for the proportional or density-independent model. The Ricker model had the most empirical support overall ( estimated parameters: a = 2.2, b = 0.009). Our results indicate that the number of successful broods would have to fall below about 5 broods/ha to generate direct declines in observed average recruitment of Florida Bass.},

A population density index was used to estimate population densities for each species growing between 1 and 15 m deep. The exponential scale of the index permitted the scoring of population densities from 0.01 to 5,000 plant growing points m−2 based upon an average observation area of 1,000 m2. SCUBA observations as a means of estimating abundance were calibrated by collecting plant shoots with densities corresponding to each point on the scale and determining the number of shoots m−2 for each species present. Direct underwater observations of plant communities covering large areas yielded comprehensive data on species diversity, population density and biomass. The population density index was found to be statistically valid using 95\% confidence limits and prediction intervals. When this index is used in conjunction with the average dry weight of mature shoots for each species, a useful estimation of the mature biomass for each species is possible to within an order of magnitude over a range from 0.01 to 200 g dry weight m−2.},

  abstract = {Forests in the Southwestern United States are becoming increasingly susceptible to large wildfires. As a result, forest managers are conducting forest fuel reduction treatments for which spatial fuels and structure information are necessary. However, this information currently has coarse spatial resolution and variable accuracy. This study tested the feasibility of using unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) imagery to estimate forest canopy fuels and structure in a southwestern ponderosa pine stand. UAV-based multispectral images and Structure-from-Motion point clouds were used to estimate canopy cover, canopy height, tree density, canopy base height, and canopy bulk density. Estimates were validated with field data from 57 plots and aerial photography from the U.S. Department of Agriculture National Agriculture Imaging Program. Results indicate that UAV imagery can be used to accurately estimate forest canopy cover (correlation coefficient (R2) = 0.82, root mean square error (RMSE) = 8.9\%). Tree density estimates correctly detected 74\% of field-mapped trees with a 16\% commission error rate. Individual tree height estimates were strongly correlated with field measurements (R2 = 0.71, RMSE = 1.83 m), whereas canopy base height estimates had a weaker correlation (R2 = 0.34, RMSE = 2.52 m). Estimates of canopy bulk density were not correlated to field measurements. UAV-derived inputs resulted in drastically different estimates of potential crown fire behavior when compared with coarse resolution LANDFIRE data. Methods from this study provide additional data to supplement, or potentially substitute, traditional estimates of canopy fuel.},

We conducted surveys from July 2008-June 2009 in 15 areas of Lake Nasser that were representative of 3 main habitat categories. During these surveys, we sampled 1,086 km of lake shore wherein we detected 386 crocodiles. Analysis of the data revealed significant variability in both inter- and intra-observer detection probabilities. Our raw encounter rate was 0.355 crocodiles/km. When we accounted for observer effects and habitat, we estimated a surface population abundance of 2,581 (2,239-2,987, 95\% credible intervals) crocodiles in Lake Nasser.

  abstract = {Pale field-rats have long disappeared from Australia’s arid and semiarid zones, other than for some Pilbara islands and a single mainland population of indeterminate status and extent identified at Shark Bay in 1968. Hence, it was noteworthy when a field-rat was first caught at Heirisson Prong in 1994, 40 km north-east of the previous location at Shark Bay. Further individuals were caught regularly from late 1995. The population peaked in July–October 2000 (with captures of \textasciitilde 190 individuals per month) and had collapsed by July 2001 (with only the occasional animal caught thereafter). None were caught beyond 2006, despite regular trapping to 2013. This irruption and collapse was beyond the established range of the species and was in atypical habitat. Widespread trapping after the collapse suggested that the population inhabited few localised ‘source’ areas and a broad area of ‘sink’ habitat, with the latter occupied only after extraordinarily high rainfall events leading to higher grass cover. A return to dry years and the consequent loss of cover (aided by an abundant rabbit population) and strong growth in predator numbers (feral cats and small birds of prey) in response to the high number of field-rats appears to have facilitated the collapse.},

Donor and public understanding of the economic factors is becoming increasingly central to the longevity of funding for conservation efforts. Unlike typical economic evaluation, many costs and benefits related to conservation efforts are realised in nonmonetary terms. We identify the types of benefits and costs that arise from conservation projects and examine several well developed techniques that economists use to convert benefits and costs into monetary values so they may be compared in a common metric. Costs are typically more readily identifiable than benefits, with financial project costs reported most frequently, and opportunity and damage costs reported much less often. Most current evaluation methods rely primarily on cost-effectiveness analysis rather than cost-benefit analysis, a result of the difficultly in measuring benefits. We highlight improved methodology to measure secondary costs and benefits on a broader spatial scale, thereby promoting project efficacy and long-term success. Estimation of the secondary effects can provide a means to engage a wider audience in discussions of wildlife conservation by illuminating the relevant impacts to income and employment in local economies.},

We conducted point counts and monitored 537 active nests of 37 species on 10 study plots during three consecutive breeding seasons in the northern Sierra Nevada. All 10 study plots had experienced a similar long term management history that included fire suppression and single-tree selection logging, but five of the plots also underwent a protocol of combined commercial and biomass thinning 5-8 years prior to the beginning of the study. Pooling species by nest substrate, we found that detections of ground-nesting bird species were similar on thinned and unthinned plots, but we detected canopy-, cavity-, and especially shrub-nesting species much more frequently on the thinned plots. Nest success rates were not statistically different between thinned and unthinned plots for ground-, shrub-, canopy-, or cavity-nesting species. Thinned stands were characterized by significantly less canopy cover, significantly lower density of small and medium conifers, and significantly greater understory cover and deer brush (Ceanothus integerrimus) cover than the unthinned stands. We surmise that the thinning protocol stimulated vigorous shrub growth, and conclude that forest conditions associated with a relatively open canopy and a well-developed shrub understory are highly beneficial to numerous breeding bird species in the Sierran mixed conifer community, including many species that may not nest or forage in the understory. Forest thinning that promotes vigorous shrub growth may correlate with an increased abundance of nesting birds, at least within stands affected by historical fire suppression and single-tree selection logging.},

  abstract = {Population size and habitat-specific abundance estimates are essential for conservation management. A major impediment to obtaining such estimates is that few statistical models are able to simultaneously account for both spatial variation in abundance and heterogeneity in detection probability, and still be amenable to large-scale applications. The hierarchical distance-sampling model of J. A. Royle, D. K. Dawson, and S. Bates provides a practical solution* Here, we extend this model to estimate habitat-specific abundance and rangewide population size of a bird species of management concern, the Island Scrub-Jay ( Aphelocoma insularis ), which occurs solely on Santa Cruz Island, California, USA. We surveyed 307 randomly selected, 300 m diameter, point locations throughout the 250-km2 island during October 2008 and April 2009. Population size was estimated to be 2267 (95\% CI 1613-3007) and 1705 (1212-2369) during the fall and spring respectively, considerably lower than a previously published but statistically problematic estimate of 12 500. This large discrepancy emphasizes the importance of proper survey design and analysis for obtaining reliable information for management decisions. Jays were most abundant in low-elevation chaparral habitat; the detection function depended primarily on the percent cover of chaparral and forest within count circles. Vegetation change on the island has been dramatic in recent decades, due to release from herbivory following the eradication of feral sheep ( Ovis aries) from the majority of the island in the mid-1980s. We applied best-fit fall and spring models of habitat-specific jay abundance to a vegetation map from 1985, and estimated the population size of A. insularis was 1400-1500 at that time. The 20-30\% increase in the jay population suggests that the species has benefited from the recovery of native vegetation since sheep removal. Nevertheless, this jay's tiny range and small population size make it vulnerable to natural disasters and to habitat alteration related to climate change. Our results demonstrate that hierarchical distance-sampling models hold promise for estimating population size and spatial density variation at large scales. Our statistical methods have been incorporated into the R package unmarked to facilitate their use by animal ecologists, and we provide annotated code in the Supplement.

To compare the efficiency of three methods in detecting species richness and abundance, we tested them in the grasslands of Emas National Park, central Brazil. Track census was the most effective method for detecting richness, followed by camera-trapping and direct faunal counts. Track census reached an asymptote for number of species after only 12 days, but all methods converged on similar estimates of species richness after around 30 days. There was no significant spatial correlation for species richness or total abundance, between camera trap and tracks, across the 29 samples distributed in the park. However, for some species, abundance showed significant spatial correlation between methods. Also, these rates were significantly correlated across species and the spatial correlation between methods was significantly associated with log-transformed body mass across species. We conclude that, despite the high initial costs for camera-trapping, this method is the most appropriate for mammal inventory in all environmental conditions, allowing a rapid assessment of wildlife conservation status.},

We used bird counts in sites of varying floating pennywort Hydrocotyle ranunculoides cover to explore the relationship between the weed and the waterbird community dynamics at Ngamo dam, Antelope Park, Zimbabwe. Waterbird communities in low-to-medium weed cover sites were more diverse and abundant compared to sites of high weed cover. In addition to supporting birds such as African Jacana which are able to forage within dense aquatic plants, high weed cover sites were associated with birds whose diets include invertebrates and fish which are likely more abundant and diverse in these sites. In contrast, low-to-medium weed cover sites were associated with bird species such as Common Moorhen, Great Egret, Pied Kingfisher and African Fish Eagle which require accessible open water and forage for diving, swimming or wading. The increased bird abundance in low-to-medium weed cover sites also likely increases prey for predatory birds. Thus, the negative changes in the waterbird community composition, abundance and diversity in response to increasing floating pennywort cover reflects species-specific tolerances to floating pennywort and its influence on accessible open water, foraging sites and prey availability.},

  abstract = {We have developed a system for simulating the conditions of avian surveys in which birds are identified by sound. The system uses a laptop computer to control a set of amplified MP3 players placed at known locations around a survey point. The system can realistically simulate a known population of songbirds under a range of factors that affect detection probabilities. The goals of our research are to describe the sources and range of variability affecting point-count estimates and to find applications of sampling theory and methodologies that produce practical improvements in the quality of bird-census data. Initial experiments in an open field showed that, on average, observers tend to undercount birds on unlimited-radius counts, though the proportion of birds counted by individual observers ranged from 81\% to 132\% of the actual total. In contrast to the unlimited-radius counts, when data were truncated at a 50-m radius around the point, observers overestimated the total population by 17\% to 122\%. Results also illustrate how detection distances decline and identification errors increase with increasing levels of ambient noise. Overall, the proportion of birds heard by observers decreased by 28 ± 4.7\% under breezy conditions, 41 ± 5.2\% with the presence of additional background birds, and 42 ± 3.4\% with the addition of 10 dB of white noise. These findings illustrate some of the inherent difficulties in interpreting avian abundance estimates based on auditory detections, and why estimates that do not account for variations in detection probability will not withstand critical scrutiny.

However, despite the substantial time, effort, and money expended counting birds in ecological research and monitoring, the validity of common survey methods remains largely untested, and there is still considerable disagreement over the importance of estimating detection probabilities associated with individual counts. Most practitioners assume that current methods for estimating detection probability are accurate, and that observer training obviates the need to account for measurement and misclassification errors in point count data. Our approach combines empirical data from field studies with field experiments using a system for simulating avian census conditions when most birds are identified by sound. Our objectives are to: identify the factors that influence detection probability on auditory point counts, quantify the bias and precision of current sampling methods, and find new applications of sampling theory and methodologies that produce practical improvements in the quality of bird census data. We have found that factors affecting detection probabilities on auditory counts, such as ambient noise, can cause substantial biases in count data. Distance sampling data are subject to substantial measurement error due to the difficulty of estimating the distance to a sound source when visual cues are lacking. Misclassification errors are also inherent in time of detection methods due to the difficulty of accurately identifying and localizing sounds during a count. Factors affecting detection probability, measurement errors, and misclassification errors are important but often ignored components of the uncertainty associated with point-count-based abundance estimates.},

Little is known about the ecology of these species because of the region's remoteness and the lack of robust scientific studies. Hunting, habitat modification, increased livestock grazing, disease and development are the major threats to the species. There is an urgent need for better monitoring to identify the size, distribution and dynamics of the populations of these species, and the threats to them, for effective conservation. The feasibility of standard scientific monitoring is greatly influenced by the remoteness of the region, the pre-existing scientific ideology, lack of expertise in the latest monitoring methods and awareness of biases and errors, and low capacity and logistical and financial constraints. We review the existing methods used for monitoring ungulates, identify the practical and institutional challenges to effective monitoring in Central Asia and categorize the methods based on various criteria so that researchers can plan better monitoring studies suited to particular species. We illustrate these issues using examples from several contrasting ungulate species. We recommend that scientific surveys should be complemented by increases in participatory monitoring, involving local people. The future of ungulate monitoring in Central Asia lies in a better recognition of the existing errors and biases in monitoring programmes and methods, allocation of more monitoring effort in terms of manpower, finances and logistics, understanding of robust scientific methods and sampling theory, and changing the scientific culture, as well as a commitment to ensuring that we monitor the things that matter.},

  abstract = {The intensity of harvest of wild plants and animals often varies with the distance from human settlements, processing facilities, markets, and transportation routes such as roads and rivers, resulting in marked spatial gradients in the abundance of such resources. Spatial modeling of the harvest of wild species has therefore emerged as an important research approach. The literature on such modeling is, however, fragmented between different resource types, and empirical validation of the models is often weak or absent. This paper presents a model that is intended to have validity for a wide variety of wild plant and animal resources. It combines a logistic model of resource growth with an economic model assuming that costs associated with harvest consist of three components, namely transport, search, and handling, and a one-dimensional spatial structure where resource harvesters are based at a "central place" surrounded by infinite extensions of habitat for the harvested resource. Model outcomes show that the spatial distribution of harvest heavily depends on the carrying capacity and the catchability coefficient, i.e. the ease of finding and harvesting a resource unit. An empirical study of wildlife hunting and palm leaf harvest in indigenous villages in Ecuadorian Amazonia confirmed the validity of model outcomes. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {A successful wildlife management requires monitoring. Including non-scientific volunteers into monitoring actions is a common way for obtaining long-term and comprehensive data. Hunters present a valuable target group as they are spread out nationwide in Germany and additionally, they provide a know-how regarding game species. Since 1990s, various German hunting associations established monitoring programs and motivated hunters to join, in order to record population sizes of huntable game species under standardized census methods. The aim of this study was to compare instructed hunters performed spotlight counts of European brown hares with thermography in three federal states (Lower-Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, North Rhine-Westphalia) in 2015–2018 in Northern Germany. Therefore, we modelled the number of hares counted by both methods with the associated observed area. Moreover, we performed repeated thermographic counts in selected areas and performed distance sampling to test the deviations of estimated population densities within a short time period. Repeated infrared thermographic counts on three consecutive nights show a coefficient of variation from 6.6\% to 15.5\% with deviations of 2.2–2.7 hares per 100 ha, while the method of distance sampling reveals minor deviations of 0.9–1.7 hares per 100 ha and a coefficient of variation from 3.1–7.4\%. The coefficient of variation value between spotlight and infrared thermographic count lies between 0 to 21.4\%. Our model confirmed no significant differences between the European brown hare density estimations based on a spotlight count and an infrared thermographic count on the following night. The results provide insight into the dimension of the error margin of density estimations performed by spotlight counts. Therefore, we recommend to take possible counting errors into account and to ideally perform repeated counts to assess the error margin for each counting site. This would help for example to quantify the uncertainty in the calculation of mortality rates. Additionally, our results show that monitoring data generated by instructed hunters can provide reliable and valid data, if implemented and conducted in a standardized scientific way.},

We used nocturnal road surveys to study habitat associations and distribution of Eastern Whip-poor-wills to better understand and contextualize their population status and to provide a framework for subsequent research and management. We used occupancy models to associate presence of Eastern Whip-poor-wills with habitat characteristics. Global models with habitat associations at a radius of 1600 m (1.0-ha area) were the best supported by the data, suggesting that this was the scale at which the species responded to the habitat parameters we measured. At this scale, Eastern Whip-poor-wills most frequently occupied areas lower in elevation and characterized by forested, herbaceous, and wetland cover types. In contrast, high elevation conifer forest communities had substantially fewer Eastern Whip-poor-wills. Detection rates were positively correlated with moon visibility and negatively correlated with noise. We used the results of our surveys to generate a regional model to predict distributions of Eastern Whip-poor-wills and that can be used as a framework for future management. Our results suggest that succession of agricultural fields and other clearings into forested habitats with dense understory may be a contributing factor to ongoing declines of Eastern Whip-poor-wills.},

The focus on morning surveys is based on the reasonable assumption that detection is more likely when birds are most active. However, population surveys could become more time- and cost-efficient if both morning and evening sampling were equally effective, particularly for game birds, such as white-winged dove Zenaida asiatica. Texas Parks and Wildlife Department has recently implemented distance sampling to estimate population sizes and monitor an ongoing range expansion of this species. We compared morning vs. evening density estimates for white-winged doves sampled in Mason, Texas, on six separate occasions during summer 2006. Program DISTANCE (version 5.0) calculated similar detection probabilities and density estimates between paired morning and evening sampling periods. Probability of detection ranged from 0.27 to 0.46 for both morning and evening samples. Densities, in individuals/ha, ranged from 2.54 to 4.02 for morning sampling and 2.48 to 4.31 for evening sampling. In addition, variables (number of observations, cluster size, distance to cluster) used by DISTANCE did not vary substantially between morning and evening surveys. Our results suggest evening surveys are as effective as the conventional protocol of surveying white-winged doves only in the morning. Additional studies, using Program DISTANCE, should be conducted to similarly evaluate other species.},

Plots were established on a stratified random basis within 501 1km sample squares located as part of the Countryside Survey of GB. Results are primarily conveyed in terms of a classification of national land-cover into 22 mutually exclusive Broad Habitat types. Each of the fixed vegetation plots could be assigned to the Broad Habitat in which they were located in either year. Two types of analysis are reported, both based on changes in plant species composition within monitoring plots. The first examined turnover and net change between Broad Habitat types. The second quantified more subtle changes that had occurred within each Broad Habitat using a series of condition measures that summarized multivariate plant species data as a single scalar value for each plot at each time. There are major difficulties in using uncontrolled, large-scale surveillance data to unravel causal linkages and no attempt was made to quantitatively partition variation among competing causes. However, it was clear that results were broadly consistent with environmental drivers known to have operated prior to and during the survey interval. Large-scale vegetation changes could be summarized in terms of shifts along gradients of substrate fertility and disturbance. Changes implied increased nutrient availability across upland and lowland ecosystems while, in lowland landscapes, linear features and small biotope fragments saw a marked shift to species compositions associated with greater shade and less disturbance.},

Management and conservation of the species has been hidered by the lack of population monitoring data. Recent studies have demonstrated that line transect distance sampling (LTDS) is efficient for estimating population parameters for gopher tortoises, yet this method has not gained wide-spread acceptance. We attempted to use LTDS to survey gopher tortoise populations on 20 protected areas southern Georgia. USA in 2007 and 2008. We used a camera system to determine burrow occupancy at each site. The survey data were used to debsity ranged from 0.21 +/- 0.04 tortoises/ha at Ohoopee Dunes Natural Area to 1.65 +/- 0.37 tortoises/ha at General Coffee State Park. Hence, we reported only the tortoise encounter rate and burrow occupancy estimates for these sites. Population estimates obtained with area-constrained surveys and a 50\% burrow occupancy rate differed by as much as 114\% from those obtained with LTDS and occupancy estimates based on burrow scoping.

  abstract = {Surveys based on double sampling include a correction for the probability of detection by assuming complete enumeration of birds in an intensively surveyed subsample of plots. To evaluate this assumption, we calculated the probability of detecting active shorebird nests by using information from observers who searched the same plots independently. Our results demonstrate that this probability varies substantially by species and stage of the nesting cycle but less by site or density of nests. Among the species we studied, the estimated single-visit probability of nest detection during the incubation period varied from 0.21 for the White-rumped Sandpiper (Calidris fuscicollis), the most difficult species to detect, to 0.64 for the Western Sandpiper (Calidris mauri), the most easily detected species, with a mean across species of 0.46. We used these detection probabilities to predict the fraction of persistent nests found over repeated nest searches. For a species with the mean value for detectability, the detection rate exceeded 0.85 after four visits. This level of nest detection was exceeded in only three visits for the Western Sandpiper, but six to nine visits were required for the White-rumped Sandpiper, depending on the type of survey employed. Our results suggest that the double-sampling method's requirement of nearly complete counts of birds in the intensively surveyed plots is likely to be met for birds with nests that survive over several visits of nest searching. Individuals with nests that fail quickly or individuals that do not breed can be detected with high probability only if territorial behavior is used to identify likely nesting pairs.},

  abstract = {Distance sampling methods to estimate population densities are in wide use; however, this method may not be suitable for certain species or in certain habitats. Although validation of population estimates derived from distance sampling is necessary to determine the reliability of population estimates, validation is lacking in most studies. We measured densities of six lizard species, with particular emphasis on the endemic Dunes Sagebrush Lizard (Sceloporus arenicolus) at 14 sites throughout the range of this species in the Mescalero Sands ecosystem in southeastern New Mexico. We tested the accuracy of distance sampling by comparing results from 238 distance line transects to densities measured in 20 total removal plots. Density estimates from the distance sampling method (N = 238 transects) for S. arenicolus and all lizard species combined were 4.6 lizards/ha and 26.14 lizards/ha, respectively. Density estimates from the total removal plots (N = 20) were 30.0 lizards/ha for S. arenicolus and 85.0 lizards/ha for all lizard species combined. It is clear that, even in the relatively open shinnery oak sand dune habitat, distance sampling methods were not reliable and underestimated the densities of lizards. The disparity in density estimates from distance sampling versus total removal plots was caused by violation of the assumption of perfect detection of individuals on the transect line. Individuals that were unavailable for detection greatly influenced the density estimates. Because of the difficulty in correcting for biases, we suggest that distance sampling is not an appropriate sampling method for estimating densities of lizards.},

Distance sampling allows estimating population size while accounting for imperfect detection, but existing methods do not allow for estimation of demographic parameters. We develop a model that uses temporal correlation in abundance arising from underlying population dynamics to estimate demographic parameters from repeated distance sampling surveys. Using a simulation study motivated by designing a monitoring program for Island Scrub-Jays (Aphelocoma insularis), we investigated the power of this model to detect population trends. We generated temporally autocorrelated abundance and distance sampling data over six surveys, using population rates of change of 0.95 and 0.90. We fit the data generating Markovian model and a mis-specified model with a log-linear time effect on abundance, and derived post hoc trend estimates from a model estimating abundance for each survey separately. We performed these analyses for varying numbers of survey points. Power to detect population changes was consistently greater under the Markov model than under the alternatives, particularly for reduced numbers of survey points. The model can readily be extended to more complex demographic processes than considered in our simulations. This novel framework can be widely adopted for wildlife population monitoring.

For 26 of 106 detected species, we used program DISTANCE to estimate detection probabilities and densities from 660 3-min point counts in which detections were recorded within four distance annuli. For most species, estimates of detection probability, and thereby density estimates, were improved through incorporation of the proportion of forest cover at point count locations as a covariate. Our results suggest Breeding Bird Surveys would benefit from the use of distance sampling and a quantitative characterization of habitat at point count locations.

  abstract = {Payments for environmental services (PES) aim to improve the supply of environmental services by making payments to service providers, which are conditional on the provision of those services. Payments cannot be conditional unless the service can be effectively monitored, making monitoring of service provision a central feature of PES. We introduce a framework for designing monitoring programmes in PES schemes for biodiversity conservation. We suggest that decisions must be made concerning the indicators to be used (e.g. species, threats or positive actions), how they will be monitored (e.g. using ground-based or remote-sensed data) and how the monitoring information will be used to differentiate payments (e.g. trends over time, performance relative to neighbouring sites, performance against a target). We then use this framework to examine the feasibility of monitoring species and threat indicators in a community-based biodiversity payment scheme in Menabe, Madagascar. We find that detecting population changes, differences between sites, or whether a target has been met is only feasible for the most common indicators, suggesting that it may not be possible to base payments on the species conservationists are most interested in. If payments need to be based on relatively common indicators, threat indicators may be more appropriate than common species indicators due to a stronger relationship to the service of interest (presence of a rare species). It is, however, possible to incorporate information from rare indicators using accumulation curves to compare between sites. This study highlights the impact of indicator choice on the monitoring effort required in a biodiversity PES. We urge caution in the design of payment schemes and suggest it can be detrimental to structure a scheme around an indicator that cannot be effectively monitored. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Failing to account for detection probability in surveys may lead to an underestimate of population size and may compromise the ability to monitor trends if detection probability varies among surveys. Here, we use the double-observer method to estimate detection probability of cavity-nesting snow petrels (Pagodroma nivea) and Wilson's storm petrels (Oceanites oceanicus) in East Antarctica. Estimates of single-visit detection probability of nesting/roosting adult snow petrels during the incubation stage of the breeding cycle ranged from 0.86 (SE = 0.04) to 0.87 (SE = 0.04) depending upon observers. Both observers found snow petrel chicks were easier to detect than adults, with estimated detection probability for chicks ranging from 0.92 (SE = 0.03) to 1.00 (SE = 0.34 x 10(-5)). Detection probability of adult and chick snow petrels increased as cavity volume increased. Compared to snow petrels, estimated detection probability was considerably lower for nesting/roosting Wilson's storm petrels, ranging from 0.27 (SE = 0.09) to 0.50 (SE = 0.13) for each observer. These estimates of detection probability apply only to those individuals in the population that were potentially viewable or audible. Nevertheless, our results indicate that double-observer counts for ground surveys of cavity-nesting seabirds should improve estimates of population abundance in comparison with single-visit counts. Accounting for observer eVects, habitat characteristics and stage of the breeding season on detection probability should also improve estimation of population trends.},

Using an information theoretic argument we derive a measure P-D for the effective number of parameters in a model as the difference between the posterior mean of the deviance and the deviance at the posterior means of the parameters of interest. In general P-D approximately corresponds to the trace of the product of Fisher's information and the posterior covariance, which in normal models is the trace of the 'hat' matrix projecting observations onto fitted values. Its properties in exponential families are explored. The posterior mean deviance is suggested as a Bayesian measure of fit or adequacy, and the contributions of individual observations to the fit and complexity can give rise to a diagnostic plot of deviance residuals against leverages. Adding P-D to the posterior mean deviance gives a deviance information criterion for comparing models, which is related to other information criteria and has an approximate decision theoretic justification. The procedure is illustrated in some examples, and comparisons are drawn with alternative Bayesian and classical proposals. Throughout it is emphasized that the quantities required are trivial to compute in a Markov chain Monte Carlo analysis.},

Bobwhite populations in Ohio declined 9.3\% / year (95\% Cl = 7.3\% -11.2\%). Overall, populations declined 76\% (95\% CI=68-82\%) over the 21-year period. We also compared annual trends during the same period among 10 weather regions in the state. At least six weather regions showed declining population trends, but analyses for the remaining four regions were inconclusive. We mapped the distribution and abundance of bobwhites in Ohio using abundance indices from surveys conducted during 1985, 1992, and 2002. These maps revealed that the bobwhite range contracted as populations declined during 1984-2004. The current core area of bobwhite abundance is located in Southwestern Ohio, where 16 counties are open for hunting. However, bobwhite distribution shifted eastward within Southwestern Ohio during 1984-2004. Adjacent counties that are currently closed to hunting lie mostly outside the highest abundance zone. We recommend bobwhite population surveys of high resolution on counties open to hunting, as well as surrounding counties where hunting has recently been closed. However, lower resolution efforts, such as site occupancy surveys, should be conducted outside those areas to detect range expansion.},

We used this information to determine the minimum number of survey replicates necessary to infer the presence and absence of lynx in areas of similar lynx density (approximately 2.8 lynx/100 km2) with confidence. The probability of detecting lynx in mountainous habitats that support resident populations was 0.80-0.99 when surveys were conducted on an 8 3 8 km2 grid with 10 km of search effort per cell. Snow-track surveys were highly successful at detecting the presence of Canada lynx over large landscapes. Two survey replicates established absence of Canada lynx with 95\% certainty. The high probability of detection associated with snow-track surveys makes this method useful for documenting populations of Canada lynx in areas where their status is uncertain.},

Phase II trials are generally small-scale studies, and may include one or more experimental treatments with or without a control. A common feature is that the results primarily determine the course of further clinical evaluation of a treatment rather than providing de®nitive evidence of treatment ef®cacy. This means that there is more ¯exibility available in the design and analysis of such studies than in phase III trials. This has led to a range of different approaches being taken to the statistical design of stopping rules for such trials. This paper brie¯y describes and compares the different approaches. In most cases the stopping rules can be described and implemented easily without knowledge of the detailed statistical and computational methods used to obtain the rules.},

Common forest inventories are usually carried out at regular time intervals (e.g. every 10 years) and are the basis for management planning. This study investigated the potential of utilizing the data of common forest inventories for simulating the spatial distribution of forest tree locations. Fixed area plot sample data were taken from the University Forest of Pertouli, which is an uneven-aged Abies borisii regis Matf. forest. Using as criterion the index of dispersion, the tree spatial distribution was characterized as aggregated. The Neyman Type A distribution, a typical distribution of aggregated populations, was a good fit to the data, while tree locations simulation was based on the Poisson cluster process. The simulations resulting from the application of fixed area plot sampling do not incorporate information about the real distances between the trees, but they can describe adequately the spatial patterns of their locations in twodimensional space and seem to be useful tools for managers of forest ecosystems. For similar populations the detection of their aggregation seems not to be affected by a considerable decrease of the number (up to 36) and the size (up to 125 m2) of sample fixed-area plots. This method is cost effective and its use, potentially in combination with other methods, could be further investigated for its advantages.},

Both distance and multiple observer methods require the sometimes unrealistic assumption that all birds in the population sing during the count interval. We provide a general model of detection where the total probability of detection is made up of the probability of a bird singing, i.e., availability, and the probability of detecting a bird, conditional on its having sung. We show that the time-of-detection method provides an estimate of the total probability, whereas combining the time-of-detection method with a multiple observer method enables estimation of the two components of the detection process separately. Our approach is shown to be a special case of Pollock's robust capture-recapture design where the probability that a bird does not sing is equivalent to the probability that an animal is a temporary emigrant. We estimate Hooded Warbler and Ovenbird population size, through maximum likelihood estimation, using experimentally simulated field data for which the true population sizes were known. The method performs well when singing rates and detection probabilities are high, and when observers are able to accurately localize individual birds. Population sizes are underestimated when there is heterogeneity of singing rates among individual birds, especially when singing rates are close to zero. Despite the additional expense and the potential for counting and matching errors, we encourage field ornithologists to consider using this combined method in their field studies to better understand the detection process, and to obtain better abundance estimates.},

Long-billed curlews (Numenius americanus) are a species of special concern in North America due to apparent declines in their population. Because long-billed curlews are not adequately monitored by existing programs, we undertook a 2-year study with the goals of 1) determining present long-billed curlew distribution and breeding population size in the United States and 2) providing recommendations for a long-term long-billed curlew monitoring protocol. We selected a stratified random sample of survey routes in 16 western states for sampling in 2004 and 2005, and we analyzed count data from these routes to estimate detection probabilities and abundance. In addition, we evaluated habitat along roadsides to determine how well roadsides represented habitat throughout the sampling units. We estimated there were 164,515 (SE = 42,047) breeding long-billed curlews in 2004, and 109,533 (SE = 31,060) breeding individuals in 2005. These estimates far exceed currently accepted estimates based on expert opinion. We found that habitat along roadsides was representative of long-billed curlew habitat in general. We make recommendations for improving sampling methodology, and we present power curves to provide guidance on minimum sample sizes required to detect trends in abundance.},

This subspecies is listed as a Species of Special Concern by the California Department of Fish and Game and has been petitioned for federal listing under the Endangered Species Act. The combination of suspected low numbers and the possibility of federal listing, prompted us to undertake a study to rigorously estimate the number of remaining individuals on Santa Rosa and Santa Cruz Islands. During the 2009 and 2010 breeding seasons, we surveyed sample units on Santa Rosa and Santa Cruz Islands using a double-observer method with independent observers to estimate joint detection probabilities (p), where we selected units under a stratified random sampling design. We estimated shrike abundance to be 169 in 2009 (p = 0.476) and 240 in 2010 (p = 0.825) for Santa Rosa Island, and 35 in 2009 (p = 0.816) and 42 in 2010 (p = 0.710) for Santa Cruz Island. These numbers, especially for Santa Rosa Island, are higher than previously reported but nevertheless are still low. Rapid vegetation change on both islands due to recent removal of nonnative herbivores may threaten the habitat and status of this subspecies and, therefore, we suggest that intensive demographic and habitat use research be initiated immediately to obtain additional information vital for the management of this subspecies.

The increase in birds per point from 2005 (15.1) to 2006 (21.6) was due to resident species, 17 of which were recorded more frequently in 2006.

Subtropical moist and dry forest habitats differed strongly in vegetation characteristics and plant species, but no species of birds exhibited a strong affiliation with either habitat type on HA plots.

  abstract = {Occupancy-abundance (OA) relationships are a foundational ecological phenomenon and field of study, and occupancy models are increasingly used to track population trends and understand ecological interactions. However, these two fields of ecological inquiry remain largely isolated, despite growing appreciation of the importance of integration. For example, using occupancy models to infer trends in abundance is predicated on positive OA relationships. Many occupancy studies collect data that violate geographical closure assumptions due to the choice of sampling scales and application to mobile organisms, which may change how occupancy and abundance are related. Little research, however, has explored how different occupancy sampling designs affect OA relationships. We develop a conceptual framework for understanding how sampling scales affect the definition of occupancy for mobile organisms, which drives OA relationships. We explore how spatial and temporal sampling scales, and the choice of sampling unit (areal vs. point sampling), affect OA relationships. We develop predictions using simulations, and test them using empirical occupancy data from remote cameras on 11 medium-large mammals. Surprisingly, our simulations demonstrate that when using point sampling, OA relationships are unaffected by spatial sampling grain (i.e., cell size). In contrast, when using areal sampling (e.g., species atlas data), OA relationships are affected by spatial grain. Furthermore, OA relationships are also affected by temporal sampling scales, where the curvature of the OA relationship increases with temporal sampling duration. Our empirical results support these predictions, showing that at any given abundance, the spatial grain of point sampling does not affect occupancy estimates, but longer surveys do increase occupancy estimates. For rare species (low occupancy), estimates of occupancy will quickly increase with longer surveys, even while abundance remains constant. Our results also clearly demonstrate that occupancy for mobile species without geographical closure is not true occupancy. The independence of occupancy estimates from spatial sampling grain depends on the sampling unit. Point-sampling surveys can, however, provide unbiased estimates of occupancy for multiple species simultaneously, irrespective of home-range size. The use of occupancy for trend monitoring needs to explicitly articulate how the chosen sampling scales define occupancy and affect the occupancy-abundance relationship.},

  abstract = {In response to significant elephant population declines in the 1970s and 1980s because of poaching for ivory, the Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) banned the international trade in Asian and African elephant species by listing them on Appendix I in 1973 and 1989, respectively. Many southern African countries disagreed with the African elephant trade ban and have continued to argue against it since the mid-1980s. They maintain that their governments practise sound wildlife management policies and actions and, as a consequence, their national elephant populations have reached unsustainable size. They argue that they should not be penalized because other countries cannot manage their wildlife. Further, they say they need the proceeds from ivory and other by-product sales to finance conservation efforts. In 1997, the CITES Conference of Parties voted to allow Botswana, Namibia and Zimbabwe to auction off 50 tonnes of government ivory stockpiles to Japanese traders on a one-off experimental basis, which took place in 1999. Ivory trade opponents allege that this sale stimulated ivory demand, resulting in a surge of elephant poaching. Nevertheless, CITES voted again in 2002 to allow Botswana, Namibia and South Africa to auction off another 60 tonnes of ivory after May 2004. Trade opponents have launched an active campaign to prevent the sales, warning that they could provoke a renewed elephant holocaust. This paper reviews available quantitative evidence on ivory trade and elephant killing to evaluate the arguments of the ivory trade proponents and opponents. The evidence supports the view that the trade bans resulted generally in lower levels of ivory market scale and elephant poaching than prevailed prior to 1990. There is little evidence to support claims that the 1999 southern African ivory auctions stimulated ivory demand or elephant poaching. Levels of elephant poaching and illegal ivory trading in a country are more likely to be related to wildlife management practices, law enforcement and corruption than to choice of CITES appendix listings and consequent extent of trade restrictions. Elephant conservation and public welfare can be better served by legal ivory trade than by a trade ban, but until demand for ivory can be restrained and various monitoring and regulation measures are put into place it is premature for CITES to permit ivory sales.},

  abstract = {Gopher tortoises (Gopherus polyphemus) are candidates for range-wide listing as threatened under the U.S. Endangered Species Act. Reliable population estimates are important to inform policy and management for recovery of the species. Line transect distance sampling has been adopted as the preferred method to estimate population size. However, when tortoise density is low, it can be challenging to obtain enough tortoise observations to reliably estimate the probability of detection, a vital component of the method. We suggest a modification to the method based on counting usable tortoise burrows (more abundant than tortoises) and separately accounting for the proportion of burrows occupied by tortoises. The increased sample size of burrows can outweigh the additional uncertainty induced by the need to account for the proportion of burrows occupied. We demonstrate the method using surveys conducted within a 13,118-ha portion of the Gopher Tortoise Habitat Management Unit at Fort Gordon Army Installation, Georgia. We used a systematic random design to obtain more precise estimates, using a newly developed systematic variance estimator. Individual transects had a spatially efficient design (pseudocircuits), which greatly improved sampling efficiency on this large site. Estimated burrow density was 0.091 +/- 0.011 burrows/ha (CV = 12.6\%, 95\% CI = 0.071-0.116), with 25\% of burrows occupied by a tortoise (CV = 14.4\%), yielding a tortoise density of 0.023 +/- 0.004 tortoise/ha (CV = 19.0\%, 95\% CI = 0.016-0.033) and a population estimate of 297 tortoises (95\% CI = 210-433). These techniques are applicable to other studies and species. Surveying burrows or nests, rather than animals, can produce more reliable estimates when it leads to a significantly larger sample of detections and when the occupancy status can reliably be ascertained. Systematic line transect survey designs give better precision and are practical to implement and analyze.},

Many tortoise populations are small and isolated, which can present challenges for deriving population estimates. Our objective was to compare abundance and density estimates for a small tortoise population derived using a total burrow count versus estimates obtained with line transect distance sampling (LTDS) using repeated surveys. We also compared results of the 2 survey methods using standard burrow-to-tortoise correction factors versus assessing occupancy of all burrows with a camera scope. In addition, we compared LTDS data obtained using a compass and measuring tape to define transects to those obtained using a Global Positioning System (GPS) and Personal Data Assistant (PDA) field computer to navigate transects. Line transect distance sampling with repeated surveys (both with a measuring tape and compass and with a GPS-PDA) yielded sufficient observations of tortoises to calculate population estimates. From 18\% to 31\% of burrows were occupied by tortoises as determined with the burrow camera. We found 25 burrows during the LTDS survey that we did not find in the total count survey, which demonstrated that the assumption of 100\% detection for the total count was not met; hence, density or abundance measurements derived with this method were underestimates. We recommend using GPS-PDA technology, scoping all burrows detected, and using LTDS with repeated surveys to estimate abundance and density for small gopher tortoise populations.},

  abstract = {Wild tigers are in a critical state with an estimated population decline of more than 95\% over the past century. Improving the capacity and effectiveness of law enforcement in reducing poaching of tigers is an immediate priority to secure remaining wild populations in source sites. From 2008-2010, standardized patrol-based law enforcement monitoring (LEM) was established under the Tigers Forever Program across 8 key tiger sites in order to improve and evaluate law enforcement interventions. Patrol-based monitoring has the distinct advantage of providing regular and rapid information on illegal activities and ranger performance, although, until recently, it has received relatively little scrutiny from the conservation community. The present paper outlines a framework for implementation of LEM in tiger source sites using MIST, a computerized management information system for ranger-based data collection. The framework addresses many of the technical, practical and institutional challenges involved in the design, implementation, sustainability and evaluation of LEM. Adoption of such a framework for LEM is a cost-effective strategy to improve the efficiency of law enforcement efforts, to increase the motivation of enforcement staff and to promote the accountability of law enforcement agencies in addressing threats to tigers. When combined with independent, systematic and science-based monitoring of tigers and their prey, LEM has great potential for evaluating the effectiveness of protection-based conservation investments.},

  abstract = {Protected areas are fundamental to biodiversity conservation, but there is growing recognition of the need to extend beyond protected areas to meet the ecological requirements of species at larger scales. Landscape-scale conservation requires an evaluation of management impact on biodiversity under different land-use strategies; this is challenging and there exist few empirical studies. In a conservation landscape in northern Republic of Congo we demonstrate the application of a large-scale monitoring program designed to evaluate the impact of conservation interventions on three globally threatened species: western gorillas, chimpanzees and forest elephants, under three land-use types: integral protection, commercial logging, and community-based natural resource management. We applied distance-sampling methods to examine species abundance across different land-use types under varying degrees of management and human disturbance. We found no clear trends in abundance between land-use types. However, units with interventions designed to reduce poaching and protect habitats - irrespective of land-use type - harboured all three species at consistently higher abundance than a neighbouring logging concession undergoing no wildlife management. We applied Generalized-Additive Models to evaluate a priori predictions of species response to different landscape processes. Our results indicate that, given adequate protection from poaching, elephants and gorillas can profit from herbaceous vegetation in recently logged forests and maintain access to ecologically important resources located outside of protected areas. However, proximity to the single integrally protected area in the landscape maintained an overriding positive influence on elephant abundance, and logging roads – even subject to anti-poaching controls - were exploited by elephant poachers and had a major negative influence on elephant distribution. Chimpanzees show a clear preference for unlogged or more mature forests and human disturbance had a negative influence on chimpanzee abundance, in spite of anti-poaching interventions. We caution against the pitfalls of missing and confounded co-variables in model-based estimation approaches and highlight the importance of spatial scale in the response of different species to landscape processes. We stress the importance of a stratified design-based approach to monitoring species status in response to conservation interventions and advocate a holistic framework for landscape-scale monitoring that includes smaller-scale targeted research and punctual assessment of threats.},

  abstract = {This book begins with a review of basic results in optimal search for a stationary target. It then develops the theory of optimal search for a moving target, providing algorithms for computing optimal plans and examples of their use. Next it develops methods for computing optimal search plans involving multiple targets and multiple searchers with realistic operational constraints on search movement. These results assume that the target does not react to the search. In the final chapter there is a brief overview of mostly military problems where the target tries to avoid being found as well as rescue or rendezvous problems where the target and the searcher cooperate.~ Larry Stone wrote his definitive book Theory of Optimal Search~in 1975, dealing almost exclusively with the stationary target search problem. Since then the theory has advanced to encompass search for targets that move even as the search proceeds, and computers have developed sufficient capability to employ the improved theory. In this book, Stone joins Royset and Washburn to document and explain this expanded theory of search. The problem of how to search for moving targets arises every day in military, rescue, law enforcement, and border patrol operations.},

We validated retrievals with ground-truth data collected from two sites near Tumbarumba, New South Wales, Australia. In a ponderosa pine plantation, LAI values of 1.84 and 2.18 retrieved by two different methods using a single EVI scan bracketed a value of 1.98 estimated by allometric equations. In a natural, but managed, Eucalypus stand, eight scans provided mean LAI values of 2.28–2.47, depending on the method, which compare favorably with a value of 2.4 from hemispherical photography. The retrieved foliage profile clearly showed two canopy layers. A “find-trunks” algorithm processed the EVI scans at both sites to identify stems, determine their diameters, and measure their distances from the scan center. Distances were retrieved very accurately (r2 = 0.99). The accuracy of EVI diameter retrieval decreased somewhat with distance as a function of angular resolution of the instrument but remained unbiased. We estimated stand basal area, mean diameter, and stem count density using the Relaskop method of variable radius plot sampling and found agreement with manual Relaskop values within about 2\% after correcting for the obscuring of far trunks by near trunks (occlusion). These early trials prove the potential of under-canopy, upward-scanning lidar to retrieve forest structural parameters quickly and accurately.},

  abstract = {Bias introduced by detection errors is a well-documented issue for abundance and occupancy estimates of wildlife. Detection errors bias estimates of detection and abundance or occupancy in positive and negative directions, which can produce misleading results. There have been considerable design- and model-based methods to address false-negative errors, or missed detections. However, false-positive errors, or detections of individuals that are absent but counted as present because of misidentifications or double counts, are often assumed to not occur in ecological studies. The dependent double-observer survey method is a design-based approach speculated to reduce false positives because observations have the ability to be confirmed by two observers. However, whether this method reduces false positives compared to single-observer methods has not been empirically tested. We used prairie songbirds as a model system to test if a dependent double-observer method reduced false positives compared to a single-observer method. We used vocalizations of ten species to create auditory simulations and used naive and expert observers to survey these simulations using single-observer and dependent double-observer methods. False-positive rates were significantly lower using the dependent double-observer survey method in both observer groups. Expert observers reported a 3.2\% false-positive rate in dependent double-observer surveys and a 9.5\% false-positive rate in single-observer surveys, while naive observers reported a 39.1\% false-positive rate in dependent double-observer surveys and a 49.1\% false-positive rate in single-observer surveys. Misidentification errors arose in all survey scenarios and almost all species combinations. However, expert observers using the dependent double-observer method performed significantly better than other survey scenarios. Given the use of double-observer methods and the accumulating evidence that false positives occur in many survey methods across different taxa, this study is an important step forward in acknowledging and addressing false positives.},

  abstract = {Problems and correlates of success in the conservation of Africa's rain forests were evaluated for 16 protected areas in 11 countries, representing approximately half of all protected areas in this biome. Data were obtained from questionnaires, published and unpublished accounts, and direct observations. Despite numerous problems, all protected areas conserved indigenous rain forest biodiversity more effectively than did alternative land uses. More than half the protected areas suffered extensive ecological isolation. Effective management of protected areas was seriously compromised by inadequate funding and government support. Dense human populations, often resulting from immigration, constituted major threats to, protected areas. Perceived conservation success was greatest for large protected areas surrounded by similar habitat with strong public support, effective law enforcement, low human population densities, and substantial support from international donors. Contrary to expectations, protected area success was not directly correlated with employment benefits for the neighboring community, conservation education, conservation clubs, or with the presence and extent of integrated conservation and development programs. Studies are needed to better understand what shapes positive pubic attitude towards protected areas because none of the conventional public outreach programs were correlated with public attitude. We also identify apparent deficiencies in foreign assistance to these protected areas. The single most important short-term strategy was considered to be the improvement of law enforcement effectiveness through greater technical and financial support. Nine medium-term strategies are identified, including provision of adequate and secure long-term funding, establishing research and monitoring programs, and developing more appropriate conservation and development programs. Long-term strategies deal with two ultimate causal factors, mainly attitudes and value systems, and stabilizing human populations. Future success of Africa's protected areas is contingent upon long-term international assistance including contingencies mandating realistic performance standards. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {Human land cover can degrade estuaries directly through habitat loss and fragmentation or indirectly through nutrient inputs that reduce water quality. Strong precipitation events are occurring more frequently, causing greater hydrological connectivity between watersheds and estuaries. Nutrient enrichment and dissolved oxygen depletion that occur following these events are known to limit populations of benthic macroinvertebrates and commercially harvested species, but the consequences for top consumers such as birds remain largely unknown. We used non-metric multidimensional scaling (MDS) and structural equation modeling (SEM) to understand how land cover and annual variation in rainfall interact to shape waterbird community composition in Chesapeake Bay, USA. The MDS ordination indicated that urban subestuaries shifted from a mixed generalist-specialist community in 2002, a year of severe drought, to generalist-dominated community in 2003, of year of high rainfall. The SEM revealed that this change was concurrent with a sixfold increase in nitrate-N concentration in subestuaries. In the drought year of 2002, waterbird community composition depended only on the direct effect of urban development in watersheds. In the wet year of 2003, community composition depended both on this direct effect and on indirect effects associated with high nitrate-N inputs to northern parts of the Bay, particularly in urban subestuaries. Our findings suggest that increased runoff during periods of high rainfall can depress water quality enough to alter the composition of estuarine waterbird communities, and that this effect is compounded in subestuaries dominated by urban development. Estuarine restoration programs often chart progress by monitoring stressors and indicators, but rarely assess multivariate relationships among them. Estuarine management planning could be improved by tracking the structure of relationships among land cover, water quality, and waterbirds. Unraveling these complex relationships may help managers identify and mitigate ecological thresholds that occur with increasing human land cover.},

  abstract = {Although the American alligator has been well-studied in coastal marshes and large reservoirs, very few studies have taken place in the isolated. seasonal wetlands that occur within the inland portion of the alligator's range. Understanding alligator populations in these systems is important because. although they are subject to the same management strategies and regulations as their more well-studied counterparts, they may have markedly different population dynamics and densities. Additionally, understanding patterns of alligator presence in isolated, seasonal wetlands is important to Understanding how alligators may affect these critical habitats as ecosystem engineers. However, survey methods designed for large, open water systems may not work in these small, vegetated wetlands, and their efficacy in this habitat has yet to be documented. We conducted eyeshine Surveys for alligators along walking transects through isolated, seasonal wetlands in southwest Georgia. We used a double-observer method with a Huggins closed capture analysis to determine the detection probability of this method, to model the effects of observer and wetland type on that parameter and to estimate abundance. We found that detection probability for eyeshine surveys under the best-supported model was 57\%, between 2 and 5 times higher than documented in other habitats. We then compared eyeshine surveys with systematic trapping to ascertain which components of the population were more likely to be detected by each method. Both methods were effective in detecting a range of size classes in the wetlands: however, the two methods were most effective when used in concert. Wildlife biologists studying population trends and establishing harvest quotas can use this information to design surveys in the inland portion of the alligator's range.

Currently, only six strongholds remain in mainland South-east Asia. While there are estimates of the species’ presence and status in five of these, the sixth one, defined as an “expected stronghold” located in the suitable dry forest along the Salawin River between Thailand and Myanmar, is not well documented. This study assessed the status of the area as a stronghold for the Green Peafowl’s long-term survival by estimating 1) the population density, 2) the current extension of suitable habitats, and 3) the threats to its survival. The area had an estimated density of 0.27 calling males/km2 (CI = 0.07–1.01) inhabiting 9,154 km2 of a mosaic of forest types, including mixed dry pine, mixed deciduous, and dry dipterocarp forests. Higher estimates were reported in other strongholds, including 0.8 birds/km2 in Bago Yoma (Myanmar), 15.8 birds/km2 in north-east Thailand, 1.13–11.34 birds/km2 in HuaiKhaKhaeng Wildlife Sanctuary (Thailand), 0.15–1.7 birds/km2 in northern Cambodia, and 0.15–4.69 birds/km2 in eastern Cambodia / south-central Vietnam. Hunting, habitat disturbance, and the presence of humans posed the greatest danger to the species across the surveyed area. Our results confirm the potential of the area for the species’ long-term survival. However, this “expected stronghold,” which could sustain a population of over 10 calling males/km2 like other high-quality strongholds, is in dire need of a comprehensive management plan to help reduce anthropogenic pressure. Ultimately, transboundary management between Thailand and Myanmar is crucial for the long-term repopulation of this stronghold.},

  abstract = {Stream-riparian ecosystems are dynamic and complex entities that can support high levels of bird assemblage abundance and diversity. The myriad patches (e. g., aquatic, floodplain, riparian) found in the riverscape habitat mosaic attract a unique mixture of aquatic, semi-aquatic, riparian, and upland birds, each uniquely utilizing the river corridor. Whereas standard morning bird surveys are widely used across ecosystems, the variety of bird guilds and the temporal habitat partitioning that likely occur in stream-riparian ecosystems argue for the inclusion of evening surveys. At 41 stream reaches in Vermont and Idaho, USA, we surveyed bird assemblages using a combination of morning and evening fixed-width transect counts. Student's paired t-tests showed that while bird abundance was not significantly different between morning and evening surveys, bird assemblage diversity (as measured by species richness, Shannon-Weiner's index, and Simpson's index) was significantly higher in the morning than in the evening. NMS ordinations of bird species and time (i.e., morning, evening) indicated that the structure of morning bird assemblages was different from that of evening assemblages. NMS further showed that a set of species was only found in evening surveys. The inclusion of evening counts in surveying bird assemblages in stream-riparian ecosystems has important experimental and ecological implications. Experimentally, the sole use of morning bird surveys may significantly underestimate the diversity and misrepresent the community composition of bird assemblages in these ecosystems. Ecologically, many of the birds detected in evening surveys were water-associated species that occupy high trophic levels and aerial insectivores that represent unique aquatic-terrestrial energy transfers.},

Our models with the greatest support suggest that riverine bird communities respond to a suite of characteristics; representing a variety of riverscape habitats at the in-stream, floodplain, and riparian levels. Channel slope, drainage area, percent conifers, and in-stream habitat condition were among the most influential variables. We found that piscivores are potentially important indicators of riverscape condition, responding to a host of variables across the riverscape.

  abstract = {Stem diameter at breast height (DBH) and tree height (H) are commonly used measures of tree growth. We examined patterns of height growth and diameter growth along a stem using a 20-year record of an even-aged hinoki cypress (Chamaecyparis obtusa (Siebold \& Zucc.) Endl.) stand. In the region of the stem below the crown (except for the butt swell), diameter growth rates (ΔD) at different heights tended to increase slightly from breast height upwards. This increasing trend was pronounced in suppressed trees, but not as much as the variation in ΔD among individual trees. Hence, ΔD below the crown can be regarded as generally being represented by the DBH growth rate (ΔDBH) of a tree. Accordingly, the growth rate of the stem cross-sectional area increased along the stem upwards in suppressed trees, but decreased in dominant trees. The stem diameter just below the crown base (DCB), the square of which is an index of the amount of leaves on a tree, was an important factor affecting ΔDBH. DCB also had a strong positive relationship with crown length. Hence, long-term changes in the DCB of a tree were associated with long-term changes in crown length, determined by the balance between the height growth rate (ΔH) and the rising rate of the crown base (ΔHCB). Within the crown, ΔD's were generally greater than the rates below the crown. Even dying trees (ΔD\,≈\,0 below the crown) maintained ΔD\,{$>$}\,0 within the crown and ΔH\,{$>$}\,0 until about 5 years before death. This growth within the crown may be related to the need to produce new leaves to compensate for leaves lost owing to the longevity of the lower crown. These results explain the different time trajectories in DBH–H relationships among individual trees, and also the long-term changes in the DBH–H relationships. The view that a rise in the crown base is strongly related to leaf turnover helps to interpret DBH–H relationships.},

  abstract = {Wetlands in tropical agricultural landscapes are maintained largely by local institutions explicitly for human use, which is assumed to deter biodiversity. Conservation efforts have been biased towards protecting large wetlands that are assumed to be adequate to conserve the majority of species of focal taxa, usually birds. These assumptions remain untested, and landscape-scale conservation planning for wetlands is largely absent, as is a generalised understanding of wetland use by focal taxa. We designed a landscape-scale survey to understand patterns and processes determining beta diversity of birds using agricultural wetlands in south-western Uttar Pradesh, India where wetlands have experienced prolonged and intensive human use for several centuries. Observed bird species richness (99 species in 28 wetlands) is the highest known for any agricultural landscape in south Asia signifying that even intensive human use of wetlands does not necessarily deter their ability to retain biodiversity. Birds exhibited strong scale dependent wetland use underscoring the need to conserve wetlands of varying sizes and at varying densities on the landscape. Beta diversity was due largely to species turnover (0.877) with minimal effect due to nestedness (0.055) suggesting that conserving a few large wetlands will not adequately meet goals of conserving the majority of wetland bird species. Prevailing assumptions regarding biodiversity conservation in tropical agricultural wetlands require being revised, and a landscape-scale approach that incorporates ecological realities is needed. Incorporating local institutions alongside formal protectionist methods offer a potential win-win situation to maximise conservation of biodiversity in tropical agricultural wetlands.

  abstract = {This study evaluates information produced from 14 fisheries independent monitoring programs (FIM) in the Gulf of Mexico. We consider the uniqueness of information from each program and its usefulness in estimating fisheries management indices. Biomass values of 35 functional groups are extracted from an operating model (Ecospace) with a method that replicates the patterns of historic FIM samplings. Observation error is added to these data in order to create a set of pseudo data that replicate the type and quality of information obtained from FIM programs. The pseudo data were put into a separate fishery assessment model (Pella-Tomlinson) to determine management indices of each functional group (maximum sustainable yield (MSY), biomass at MSY, and fishing mortality at MSY). These indices are compared against values in Ecospace, and against previously published single-species stock assessments. We also evaluate the full suite of information derived from FIM within an ecosystem context, considering whether functional roles are over- or under-sampled, and whether sampling effort is proportional to the value of fish stocks. Results reveal that model derived fishery indices closely matched published indices for the majority of the functional groups, economic and ecological evaluation suggests that several piscivorous functional groups are under-sampled include forage base species that are likely to indirectly support fisheries for piscivores, and sampling efforts are not proportional to the value of some fish stocks. Following ecological modelling we performed statistical analyses on historic FIM catch data to identify optimal species-specific sampling months and gear-types that can be used to refine future FIM sampling efforts.}

  abstract = {The conservation of gray wolf (Canis lupus) and its coexistence with humans presents a challenge and requires continuous monitoring and management efforts. One of the noninvasive methods that produces high-quality wolf monitoring datasets is camera trapping. We present a novel monitoring approach where camera traps are positioned on wildlife crossing structures that channel the animals, thereby increasing trapping success and increasing the cost-efficiency of the method. In this way we have followed abundance trends of five wolf packs whose home ranges are intersected by a motorway which spans throughout the wolf distribution range in Croatia. During the five-year monitoring of six green bridges we have recorded 28 250 camera-events, 132 with wolves. Four viaducts were monitored for two years, recording 4914 camera-events, 185 with wolves. We have detected a negative abundance trend of the monitored Croatian wolf packs since 2011, especially severe in the northern part of the study area. Further, we have pinpointed the legal cull as probable major negative influence on the wolf pack abundance trends (linear regression, r(2) {$>$} 0.75, P {$<$} 0.05). Using the same approach we did not find evidence for a negative impact of wolves on the prey populations, both wild ungulates and livestock. We encourage strict protection of wolf in Croatia until there is more data proving population stability. In conclusion, quantitative methods, such as the one presented here, should be used as much as possible when assessing wolf abundance trends.},

During 2000, 34 I-km transects were each sampled twice in the 368.5-ha study area. We observed 46 tortoises with midline carapace lengths greater than or equal to 150 mm (subadults and adults) plus 7 juveniles on transects. For subadults and adults, the encounter rate was 0.63 tortoises/km, and the mean proportion of tortoises observable during radiotelemetry, conducted concurrently with transect sampling, was 82\%. Corrected mean density based on line transects and radiotelemetry was 0.523 tortoises/ha (CV = 22.99, 95\% CI = 0.29-0.79), and absolute abundance in the study area was estimated to be 193 (CV = 23.0\%, CI = 107-291). Using the 2 independent coverages of transects as separate samples, the Lincoln-Petersen mark-recapture estimator produced an abundance estimate of 224 subadult and adult tortoises (CV = 53.9\%, CI = 72-440). Transects measured on the ground over uneven topography resulted in 3\% smaller estimates of density when compared to analysis with transect lengths determined from coordinates plotted on a map. Distance sampling appears to be a feasible method of estimating density of Sonoran Desert populations of the desert tortoise, but transect lengths should be based on mapped rather than measured distances to prevent biases caused by uneven topography.},

Camera trap placement design is likely to influence these parameter estimates. Herein we simultaneously generate and compare estimates obtained from camera traps (a) placed to optimize large carnivore captures and (b) random placement, to infer accuracy and biases for parameter estimates. Both setups recorded 25 species when same number of trail and random cameras (n = 31) were compared. However, species accumulation rate was faster with trail cameras. Relative abundance indices (RAI) from random cameras surrogated abundance estimated from capture-mark-recapture and distance sampling, while RAI were biased higher for carnivores from trail cameras. Group size of wild-ungulates obtained from both camera setups were comparable. Random cameras detected nocturnal activities of wild ungulates in contrast to mostly diurnal activities observed from trail cameras. Our results show that trail and random camera setup give similar estimates of species richness and group size, but differ for estimates of relative abundance and activity patterns. Therefore, inferences made from each of these camera trap designs on the above parameters need to be viewed within this context.},

  abstract = {Patterns that resemble strongly skewed size distributions are frequently observed in ecology. A typical example represents tree size distributions of stem diameters. Empirical tests of ecological theories predicting their parameters have been conducted, but the results are difficult to interpret because the statistical methods that are applied to fit such decaying size distributions vary. In addition, binning of field data as well as measurement errors might potentially bias parameter estimates. Here, we compare three different methods for parameter estimation – the common maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) and two modified types of MLE correcting for binning of observations or random measurement errors. We test whether three typical frequency distributions, namely the power-law, negative exponential and Weibull distribution can be precisely identified, and how parameter estimates are biased when observations are additionally either binned or contain measurement error. We show that uncorrected MLE already loses the ability to discern functional form and parameters at relatively small levels of uncertainties. The modified MLE methods that consider such uncertainties (either binning or measurement error) are comparatively much more robust. We conclude that it is important to reduce binning of observations, if possible, and to quantify observation accuracy in empirical studies for fitting strongly skewed size distributions. In general, modified MLE methods that correct binning or measurement errors can be applied to ensure reliable results.},

  abstract = {Background Effective management depends upon accurately estimating trends in abundance of bird populations over time, and in some cases estimating abundance. Two population estimation methods, double observer (DO) and double sampling (DS), have been advocated for avian population studies and the relative merits and short-comings of these methods remain an area of debate. Methodology/Principal Findings We used simulations to evaluate the performances of these two population estimation methods under a range of realistic scenarios. For three hypothetical populations with different levels of clustering, we generated DO and DS population size estimates for a range of detection probabilities and survey proportions. Population estimates for both methods were centered on the true population size for all levels of population clustering and survey proportions when detection probabilities were greater than 20\%. The DO method underestimated the population at detection probabilities less than 30\% whereas the DS method remained essentially unbiased. The coverage probability of 95\% confidence intervals for population estimates was slightly less than the nominal level for the DS method but was substantially below the nominal level for the DO method at high detection probabilities. Differences in observer detection probabilities did not affect the accuracy and precision of population estimates of the DO method. Population estimates for the DS method remained unbiased as the proportion of units intensively surveyed changed, but the variance of the estimates decreased with increasing proportion intensively surveyed. Conclusions/Significance The DO and DS methods can be applied in many different settings and our evaluations provide important information on the performance of these two methods that can assist researchers in selecting the method most appropriate for their particular needs.},

We investigated the likely effects of these strategies on bird assemblages in tree mallee vegetation, characterized by multistemmed Eucalyptus species, where both strategies are currently employed.},

  abstract = {Unsustainable hunting threatens both biodiversity and local livelihoods. Despite high levels of research effort focused on understanding the dynamics of bushmeat trade and consumption, current research is largely site specific. Without synthesis and quantitative analysis of available case studies, the national and regional characteristics of bushmeat trade and consumption remain largely speculative, impeding efforts to inform national and regional policy on bushmeat trade. Here we describe the structure and content of the West and Central African bushmeat database which holds quantitative data on bushmeat sales, consumption and offtake for 177 species from 275 sites across 11 countries in two regions, spanning three decades of research. Despite this wealth of available data, we found important biases in research effort. The majority of studies in West and Central Africa have collected market data, which although providing a useful record of bushmeat sales, are limited in their ability to track changes in hunting offtake. In addition, few data exist for West Africa, and few studies have tracked changes over time, using repeat sampling. With new initiatives in the regions to track bushmeat hunting, this database represents an opportunity to synthesise current and future data on bushmeat hunting, consumption and trade in West and Central Africa, identify gaps in current understanding, and systematically target future monitoring efforts.},

The first device is an expensive procedure which classifies units correctly; the second device is a cheaper procedure which tends to misclassify units. To estimate p, the proportion of units which belong to one of the categories, a double sampling scheme is presented. At the first stage, a sample of N units is taken and the fallible classifications are obtained; at the second stage a subsample of n units is drawn from the main sample and the true classifications are obtained. The maximum likelihood estimate of p is derived along with its asymptotic variance. Optimum values of n and N which minimize the measurement costs for a fixed variance of estimation and which minimize the precision for fixed cost are derived. This double sampling scheme is compared to the binomial sampling scheme in which only true measurements are obtained.}

  abstract = {Artificial coastal reefs were initially installed off Reunion Island (SW Indian Ocean) in order to attract and catch small pelagic fish of economic importance for the local fishery. These artificial reefs also attract a high density of juvenile coral reef fish, especially after recruitment. Because of high species richness and density, a suitable method of evaluating diversity and abundance in such assemblages is needed. An experiment was conducted in situ for 1 year in order to test which of the two visual techniques, slate or video recording, would be the most suitable for sampling artificial reefs. For the quantitative study, a rope framework (four belt transects each measuring 24×3 m) was used to ease the movement of the divers. To avoid bias due to time variations, the study was conducted under limited time in situ. The advantages and disadvantages of the two techniques regarding the accuracy of qualitative and quantitative results are discussed. The qualitative study results show that the slate technique is the most accurate one for determining species richness. In the quantitative study, factors such as species characteristics (ecological type), attractiveness (relationship between fish and diver) and abundance of fish communities around the artificial reefs appear to influence our results on the comparison of the two techniques. Of 13 ‘permanent’ (observed in more than 75\% of dives) species, 6 returned a similar frequency of detection by slate and video (Lutjanus kasmira, Lutjanus bengalensis, Priacanthus hamrur, Chaetodon kleinii, Heniochus diphreutes, Mulloides vanicolensis); these were then selected for comparison of the techniques using quantitative data. The correlation between video and slate census results is high, but, in comparison with the slate census, the video census underestimates abundance, especially for low values. A corrected index is proposed to remedy this underestimation; it could be used for video surveys conducted on species responding well to video detection (as below).},

During 2007 and 2008, 557 discrete wetlands were surveyed and nine additional large wetland complexes sampled in Mexico and the USA. From these surveys, a population of 23,555 (95\% CI = 17,299 - 29,859) breeding Snowy Plovers was estimated. Combining the estimate with information from areas not surveyed, the total North American population was assessed at 25,869 (95\% CI = 18,917 - 32,173). Approximately 42\% of all breeding Snowy Plovers in North America resided at two sites (Great Salt Lake, Utah, and Salt Plains National Wildlife Refuge, Oklahoma), and 33\% of all these were on wetlands in the Great Basin (including Great Salt Lake). Also, coastal habitats in central and southern Texas supported large numbers of breeding plovers. New breeding sites were discovered in interior deserts and highlands and along the Pacific coast of Mexico; approximately 9\% of the North American breeding population occurred in Mexico. Because of uncertainties about effects of climate change and current stresses to breeding habitats, the species should be a management and conservation priority. Periodic monitoring should be undertaken at important sites to ensure high quality habitat is available to support the Snowy Plover population. Received 22 July 2011, accepted 18 October 2011.},

The biological system is described by a state-space model, where the true but unknown state of the population is modelled by a state process, and this is linked to survey data by an observation process. All sources of uncertainty in the inputs, including uncertainty about model specification, are readily incorporated. The paper shows how the state process can be represented as a generalization of the standard Leslie or Lefkovitch matrix. By dividing the state process into subprocesses, complex models can be constructed from manageable building blocks. The paper illustrates the approach with a model of the British grey seal metapopulation, using sequential importance sampling with kernel smoothing to fit the model.},

  abstract = {Avian point-count surveys are typically designed to occur during periods when birds are consistently active and singing, but seasonal and diurnal patterns of detection probability are often not well understood and may vary regionally or between years. We deployed autonomous acoustic recorders to assess how avian availability for detection (i.e., the probability that a bird signals its presence during a recording) varied during the breeding season with time of day, date, and weather-related variables at multiple subarctic tundra sites in Alaska, USA, 2013-2014. A single observer processed 2,692 10-minute recordings across 11 site-years. We used time-removal methods to assess availability and used generalized additive models to examine patterns of detectability (joint probability of presence, availability, and detection) for 16 common species. Despite lack of distinct dawn or dusk, most species displayed circadian vocalization patterns, with detection rates generally peaking between 0800 hours and 1200 hours but remaining high as late as 2000 hours for some species. Between 2200 hours and 0500 hours, most species' detection rates dropped to near 0, signaling a distinctive rest period. Detectability dropped sharply for most species in early July. For all species considered, time-removal analysis indicated nearly 100\% likelihood of detection during a 10-minute recording conducted in June, between 0500 hours and 2000 hours. This indicates that non-detections during appropriate survey times and dates were attributable to the species' absence or that silent birds were unlikely to initiate singing during a 10-minute interval, whereas vocally active birds were singing very frequently. Systematic recordings revealed a gradient of species' presence at each site, from ubiquitous to incidental. Although the total number of species detected at a site ranged from 16 to 27, we detected only 4 to 15 species on 5\% of the site's recordings. Recordings provided an unusually detailed and consistent dataset that allowed us to identify, among other things, appropriate survey dates and times for species breeding at northern latitudes. Our results also indicated that more recordings of shorter duration (1-4min) may be most efficient for detecting passerines. (c) 2017 The Wildlife Society. Our paper describes in detail the vocalization patterns of subarctic birds based on analysis of ¿2,600 acoustic recordings. We found that most species were highly detectable immediately upon arrival on breeding areas and that detectability remained high for most hours of the day. Additionally, when processing audio recordings, we found that in any single 10-minute recording, the majority of species detected were noted within the first minute; thus, individuals that are present and available to be detected by song or call tend to be highly detectable during a discrete time interval and more frequent, shorter duration recordings might be a more efficient way to detect the species using a given sampling area.},

We describe an iterative, three-phased process for developing sampling designs based on our efforts to establish a vegetation monitoring program in southwest Alaska. In the first phase, we defined a sampling frame based on land ownership and specific vegetated habitats within the park boundaries and used Path Distance analysis tools to create a GIS layer that delineated portions of each park that could be feasibly accessed for ground sampling. In the second phase, we used simulations based on landcover maps to identify size and configuration of the ground sampling units (single plots or grids of plots) and to refine areas to be potentially sampled. In the third phase, we used a second set of simulations to estimate sample size and sampling frequency required to have a reasonable chance of detecting a minimum trend in vegetation cover for a specified time period and level of statistical confidence. Results of the first set of simulations indicated that a spatially balanced random sample of single plots from the most common landcover types yielded the most efficient sampling scheme. Results of the second set of simulations were compared with field data and indicated that we should be able to detect at least a 25\% change in vegetation attributes over 31 years by sampling 8 or more plots per year every five years in focal landcover types. This approach would be especially useful in situations where ground sampling is restricted by access. Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Mean abundance estimates increased with longer count duration (6-, 8-, and 10-min) for only two of 13 species, and CVs did not necessarily decrease. The power to detect a 5\% annual Population trend increased with more survey points, more visits per point, and more years of surveys. Managers can use observer time most efficiently by employing counts of short duration. Counts using a larger radius will reduce CVs and therefore provide potentially better annual estimates of abundance and power to detect changes over a period of years. The design of the study and nature of the variability in bird abundance will determine whether increasing the number of points, or the number of visits per point, will have greater effect on power to detect a population trend.},

  abstract = {The use of bird counts as indices has come under increasing scrutiny because assumptions concerning detection probabilities may not be met, but there also seems to be some resistance to use of model-based approaches to estimating abundance. We used data from the United States Forest Service, Southern Region bird monitoring program to compare several common approaches for estimating annual abundance or indices and population trends from point-count data. We compared indices of abundance estimated as annual means of counts and from a mixed-Poisson model to abundance estimates from a count-removal model with 3 time intervals and a distance model with 3 distance bands. We compared trend estimates calculated from an autoregressive, exponential model fit to annual abundance estimates from the above methods and also by estimating trend directly by treating year as a continuous covariate in the mixed-Poisson model. We produced estimates for 6 forest songbirds based on an average of 621 and 459 points in 2 physiographic areas from 1997 to 2004. There was strong evidence that detection probabilities varied among species and years. Nevertheless, there was good overall agreement across trend estimates from the 5 methods for 9 of 12 comparisons. In 3 of 12 comparisons, however, patterns in detection probabilities potentially confounded interpretation of uncorrected counts. Estimates of detection probabilities differed greatly between removal and distance models, likely because the methods estimated different components of detection probability and the data collection was not optimally designed for either method. Given that detection probabilities often vary among species, years, and observers investigators should address detection probability in their surveys, whether it be by estimation of probability of detection and abundance, estimation of effects of key covariates when modeling count as an index of abundance, or through design-based methods to standardize these effects.

Protection becomes increasingly effective with increasing size of forest fragments. For forest fragments ¿50 ha our results show that strict protection (International Union for Conservation of Nature [IUCN] categories I-IV) is strongly associated with higher bird occurrence, whereas fragments had to be at least 175 ha for moderate protection (IUCN categories V and VI) to have a positive effect.

Spatial and temporal variation in resource availability may provide insight into how ecological factors, such as resource abundance, and evolutionary factors, such as phylogenetically conserved morphological traits, influence specialization within mutualistic networks. We used independent measures of hummingbird abundance and resources (nectar), information on hummingbird traits and plant-hummingbird interactions to examine how resource availability and species' morphology influence the specialization of hummingbirds in three habitat types (forest, shrubs, cattle ranch) sampled over 10 sessions across two years in the southern Andes of Ecuador. Specialization of hummingbird species in the networks was measured by three indices: d' (related to niche partitioning), generality (related to niche width) and PSI (related to pollination services). Specialization indices d', generality and PSI of hummingbird species were influenced by resource availability. All indices indicated that specialization of hummingbirds increased when the availability of resources decreased. Variation in d' was also explained by an interaction between resource availability and bill length; hummingbirds with a long bill switched from being more specialized than other species when resource availability was low to being similarly specialized when availability was high. Overall, our results highlight the importance of ecological and evolutionary factors determining the specialization of species in interaction networks. We demonstrate in particular that ecological gradients in resource availability cause substantial changes in consumers' foraging behavior contingent on their morphology. Changes in pollinator specialization along resource gradients can have impacts on ecosystem functions, such as pollination by animals.},

However, most of the research on the effects of land use change has focused on taxonomic diversity, while functional diversity, an important predictor of ecosystem services, is often neglected. We explored how local and landscape scale characteristics influence functional and taxonomic diversity of hummingbirds in the Andes Mountains in southern Ecuador. Data was collected in six landscapes along a land use gradient, from an almost intact landscape to one dominated by cattle pastures. We used point counts to sample hummingbirds from 2011 to 2012 to assessed how local factors (i.e., vegetation structure, flowering plants richness, nectar availability) and landscape factors (i.e., landscape heterogeneity, native vegetation cover) influenced taxonomic and functional diversity. Then, we analyzed environment - trait relationships (RLQ test) to explore how different hummingbird functional traits influenced species responses to these factors. Taxonomic and functional diversity of hummingbirds were positively associated with landscape heterogeneity but only functional diversity was positively related to native vegetation coverage. We found a weak response of taxonomic and functional diversity to land use change at the local scale. Environment-trait associations showed that body mass of hummingbirds likely influenced species sensitivity to land use change. In conclusion, landscape heterogeneity created by land use change can positively influence hummingbird taxonomic and functional diversity; however, a reduction of native vegetation cover could decrease functional diversity. Given that functional diversity can mediate ecosystem services, the conservation of native vegetation cover could play a key role in the maintenance of hummingbird pollination services in the tropical Andes. Moreover, there are particular functional traits, such as body mass, that increase a species sensitivity to land use change.},

  abstract = {There is an urgent need for information on western gorilla population sizes and distribution to improve present and plan future conservation actions. Researchers traditionally have estimated gorilla densities on the basis of nest counts despite demonstrated variation in nest production and decay rates. The variation may lead to large biases in estimates of gorilla abundance. We investigated the use of an alternate index of gorilla abundance, via defecation data collected from habituated gorillas at Bai Hokou, Central African Republic. Our sample of 274/370 defecation events/dung piles produced a production rate of ca. 5 dung piles/d: comparable to previous estimates based on much smaller sample sizes. Heuristic models that failed to account for imperfect dung pile detection produced a lower defecation rate estimate than that of a maximum likelihood model that explicitly modeled detection probability. Generalized linear modeling (GLM) showed that dung pile production rate was strongly linked to rainfall, suggesting that failure to correct for seasonal variation in dung pile production rates could lead to substantial biases in gorilla abundance estimates. In our study, failing to distinguish between the number of defecation events and the number of dung piles produced would lead to a ca. 31\% overestimate of true gorilla numbers. The use of dung as an index of gorilla abundance shows potential, but more fieldwork and modeling on seasonal variation in dung production rates is required.},

  abstract = {Anthropogenic factors have significantly influenced the frequency, duration, and intensity of meteorological drought in many regions of the globe, and the increased frequency of wildfires is among the most visible consequences of human-induced climate change. Despite the fire role in determining biodiversity outcomes in different ecosystems, wildfires can cause negative impacts on wildlife. We conducted ground surveys along line transects to estimate the first-order impact of the 2020 wildfires on vertebrates in the Pantanal wetland, Brazil. We adopted the distance sampling technique to estimate the densities and the number of dead vertebrates in the 39,030 square kilometers affected by fire. Our estimates indicate that at least 16.952 million vertebrates were killed immediately by the fires in the Pantanal, demonstrating the impact of such an event in wet savanna ecosystems. The Pantanal case also reminds us that the cumulative impact of widespread burning would be catastrophic, as fire recurrence may lead to the impoverishment of ecosystems and the disruption of their functioning. To overcome this unsustainable scenario, it is necessary to establish proper biomass fuel management to avoid cumulative impacts caused by fire over biodiversity and ecosystem services.},

  abstract = {Starting in the 1970s, many populations of large-bodied mammalian carnivores began to recover from centuries of human-caused eradication and habitat destruction. The recovery of several such populations has since slowed or reversed due to mortality caused by humans. Illegal killing (poaching) is a primary cause of death in many carnivore populations. Law enforcement agencies face difficulties in preventing poaching and scientists face challenges in measuring it. Both challenges are exacerbated when evidence is concealed or ignored. We present data on deaths of 937 Wisconsin gray wolves (Canis lupus) from October 1979 to April 2012 during a period in which wolves were recolonizing historic range mainly under federal government protection. We found and partially remedied sampling and measurement biases in the source data by reexamining necropsy reports and reconstructing the numbers and causes of some wolf deaths that were never reported. From 431 deaths and disappearances of radiocollared wolves aged {$>$} 7.5 months, we estimated human causes accounted for two-thirds of reported and reconstructed deaths, including poaching in 39-45\%, vehicle collisions in 13\%, legal killing by state agents in 6\%, and nonhuman causes in 36-42\%. Our estimate of poaching remained an underestimate because of persistent sources of uncertainty and systematic underreporting. Unreported deaths accounted for over two-thirds of all mortality annually among wolves {$>$} 7.5 months old. One-half of all poached wolves went unreported, or {$>$} 80\% of poached wolves not being monitored by radiotelemetry went unreported. The annual mortality rate averaged 18\% +/- 10\% for monitored wolves but 47\% +/- 19\% for unmonitored wolves. That difference appeared to be due largely to radiocollaring being concentrated in the core areas of wolf range, as well as higher rates of human-caused mortality in the periphery of wolf range. We detected an average 4\% decline in wolf population growth in the last 5 years of the study. Because our estimates of poaching risk and overall mortality rate exceeded official estimates after 2012, we present all data for transparency and replication. More recent additions of public hunting quotas after 2012 appear unsustainable without effective curtailment of poaching. Effective antipoaching enforcement will require more accurate estimates of poaching rate, location, and timing than currently available. Independent scientific review of methods and data will improve antipoaching policies for large carnivore conservation, especially for controversial species facing high levels of human-induced mortality.},

The majority of survey observations occurred in the central and northern part of Saipan Lagoon, which correlated with capture locations documented in the commercial fishery landings. Analysis of contemporary and historical commercial fishery data showed that HHW could not be considered primary fishery target species. Distance sampling results indicated that coral/hard bottom and Enhalus acroroides seagrass were the habitats most important to HHW, as reflected by higher density estimates. The use of distance sampling was useful in estimating the spatial distribution and density of HHW, and should be considered when assessing other rare marine finfish species.},

I updated estimated regional bird populations for the East Gulf Coastal Plain of Mississippi using data from 275 North American Breeding Bird Surveys from 2009 to 2013. However, regional bird populations estimated from count surveys of breeding birds may be biased due to lack of empirical knowledge of the distance at which a species is effectively detected and the probability of detecting a species if it is present. I used data recorded within two distance classes (0-50 m and ¿50-400 m) and three 1-min time intervals on 130 Breeding Bird Surveys to estimate detection probability and effective detection distance for 77 species. Incorporating these empirical estimates of detection probability and detection distance resulted in estimated regional populations for these species that were markedly greater than regional populations estimated without species-specific estimates of detection parameters. Using the same Breeding Bird Survey data, I also estimated probability of site occupancy for 66 species and extrapolated this to the proportion of area occupied in the East Gulf Coastal Plain of Mississippi. I combined the area occupied with the reported range of breeding territory size for 54 species to obtain independent estimates of regional bird populations. Although the true population of these species is unknown, estimated populations that incorporated empirical estimates of detection probability and detection distance were more likely to be within the range of independently estimated, occupancy-based, regional population estimates than were population estimates that lacked empirical detection and distance information.},

  abstract = {With increasing human pressures on wildlife comes a responsibility to monitor them effectively, particularly in an environment of declining research funds. Scarce funding resources compromise the level and efficacy of monitoring possible to detect trends in abundance, highlighting the priority for developing cost-effective programs. A systematic and rigorous sampling regime was developed to estimate abundance of a small, genetically isolated spinner dolphin (Stenella longirostris) population exposed to high levels of human activities. Five monitoring scenarios to detect trends in abundance were evaluated by varying sampling effort, precision, power, and sampling interval. Scenario 1 consisted of monthly surveys, each of 12days, used to obtain the initial two consecutive annual abundance estimates. Scenarios 2, 3, and 4 consisted of a reduced effort, while Scenario 5 doubled the effort of Scenario 1. Scenarios with the greatest effort (1 and 5) produced the most precise abundance estimates (CV=0.09). Using a CV=0.09 and power of 80\%, it would take 9years to detect a 5\% annual change in abundance compared with 12years at a power of 95\%. Under this best-case monitoring scenario, if the trend was a decline, the population would have decreased by 37\% and 46\%, respectively, prior to detection of a significant decline. With the potential of a large decline in a small population prior to detection, the lower power level should be used to trigger a management intervention. The approach presented here is applicable across taxa for which individuals can be identified, including terrestrial and aquatic mammals, birds, and reptiles.},

We show that false-negative errors (failure to record a species when in fact it is present) can have a significant impact on statistical estimation of habitat models using simulated data. Then we introduce an extension of logistic modeling, the zero-inflated binomial (ZIB) model that permits the estimation of the rate of false-negative errors and the correction of estimates of the probability of occurrence for false-negative errors by using repeated visits to the same site. Our simulations show that even relatively low rates of false negatives bias statistical estimates of habitat effects. The method with three repeated visits eliminates the bias, but estimates are relatively imprecise. Six repeated visits improve precision of estimates to levels comparable to that achieved with conventional statistics in the absence of false-negative errors. In general, when error rates are ≤50\% greater efficiency is gained by adding more sites, whereas when error rates are {$>$}50\% it is better to increase the number of repeated visits. We highlight the flexibility of the method with three case studies, clearly demonstrating the effect of false-negative errors for a range of commonly used survey methods.},

Live-trapping at 42 different sites allowed modeling of occupancy and relative abundance using environmental covariates while incorporating imperfect detection. Species richness was higher in smaller openings on southwest-facing aspects. Similarity between species richness of different age classes decreased with increasing site age. Eastern chipmunk (Tamias striatus) relative abundance was greater in early seral stages, i.e., at young sites with low basal areas. Relative abundance of white-footed mice (Peromyscus leucopus) exhibited different responses to coarse woody debris on sites versus microsites. Pine voles (Microtus pinetorum) and short-tailed shrews (Blarina brevicauda) were more likely to occupy older sites. We observed a greater relative abundance of short-tailed shrews at sites with steep and northeast-facing slopes. Northeast-facing slopes also resulted in higher short-tailed shrew occupancy rates. Incorporating detection probability enabled us to derive more accurate estimates of relative abundance and, when coupled with a Bayesian framework, permitted the estimation of occupancy for uncommon species. Our estimated responses can be used by forest managers to determine the potential impacts of even-aged and uneven-aged oak management on small mammals, and the statistical methodology we used can be applied even more broadly to improve understanding of wildlife responses to forest management.

Human landscape modifications, such as habitat destruction and fragmentation, can alter the abundance of fruiting plants and animal dispersers, foraging rates, vector movement, and the composition of the disperser community, all of which can singly or in concert affect seed dispersal. Here, we quantify and tease apart the effects of landscape configuration, namely, fragmentation of primary forest and the composition of the surrounding forest matrix, on individual components of seed dispersal of Heliconia acuminata, an Amazonian understory herb. First we identified the effects of landscape configuration on the abundance of fruiting plants and six bird disperser species. Although highly variable in space and time, densities of fruiting plants were similar in continuous forest and fragments. However, the two largest-bodied avian dispersers were less common or absent in small fragments. Second, we determined whether fragmentation affected foraging rates. Fruit removal rates were similar and very high across the landscape, suggesting that Heliconia fruits are a key resource for small frugivores in this landscape. Third, we used radiotelemetry and statistical models to quantify how landscape configuration influences vector movement patterns. Bird dispersers flew farther and faster, and perched longer in primary relative to secondary forests. One species also altered its movement direction in response to habitat boundaries between primary and secondary forests. Finally, we parameterized a simulation model linking data on fruit density and disperser abundance and behavior with empirical estimates of seed retention times to generate seed dispersal patterns in two hypothetical landscapes. Despite clear changes in bird movement in response to landscape configuration, our simulations demonstrate that these differences had negligible effects on dispersal distances. However, small fragments had reduced densities of Turdus albicollis, the largest-bodied disperser and the only one to both regurgitate and defecate seeds. This change in Turdus abundance acted together with lower numbers of fruiting plants in small fragments to decrease the probability of long-distance dispersal events from small patches. These findings emphasize the importance of foraging style for seed dispersal and highlight the primacy of habitat size relative to spatial configuration in preserving biotic interactions.},

  abstract = {In the context of wildlife population declines, increasing computer power over the last 20 years allowed wildlife managers to apply advanced statistical techniques that has improved population size estimates. However, respecting the assumptions of the models that consider the probability of detection, such as N-mixture models, requires the implementation of a rigorous monitoring protocol with several replicate survey occasions and no double counting that are hardly adaptable to field conditions. When the logistical, economic and ecological constraints are too strong to meet model assumptions, it may be possible to combine data from independent surveys into the modelling framework in order to understand population dynamics more reliably. Here, we present a state-space model with an error process modelled on the log scale to evaluate wintering waterfowl numbers in the Camargue, southern France, while taking a conditional probability of detection into consideration. Conditional probability of detection corresponds to estimation of a detection probability index, which is not a true probability of detection, but rather conditional on the difference to a particular baseline. The large number of sites (wetlands within the Camargue delta) and years monitored (44) provide significant information to combine both terrestrial and aerial surveys (which constituted spatially and temporally replicated counts) to estimate a conditional probability of detection, while accounting for false-positive counting errors and changes in observers over the study period. The model estimates abundance indices of wintering Common Teal, Mallard and Common Coot, all species abundant in the area. We found that raw counts were underestimated compared to the predicted population size. The model-based data integration approach as described here seems like a promising solution that takes advantage of as much as possible of the data collected from several methods when the logistic constraints do not allow the implementation of a permanent monitoring and analysis protocol that takes into account the detectability of individuals.},

  abstract = {Theobroma cacao plantings, when managed under the shade of rainforest trees, provide habitat for many resident and migratory bird species. We compared the bird diversity and community structure in organic cacao farms and nearby forest fragments throughout mainland Bocas del Toro, Panama. We used this dataset to ask the following questions: (1) How do bird communities using cacao habitat compare to communities of nearby forest fragments? (2) To what extent do Northern migratory birds use shaded cacao farms, and do communities of resident birds shift their abundances in cacao farms seasonally? (3) Do small scale changes in shade management of cacao farms affect bird diversity? Using fixed radius point counts and additional observations, we recorded 234 landbird species, with 102 species that were observed in both cacao and forest fragments, 86 species that were only observed in cacao farms, and 46 species that were restricted to forest fragments. Cacao farms were rich in canopy and edge species such as tanagers, flycatchers and migratory warblers, but understory insectivores were nearly absent from cacao farms. We observed 27 migratory species, with 18 species in cacao farms only, two species in forest only, and seven species that occurred in both habitats. In cacao farms, the diversity of birds was significantly greater where there was less intensive management of the canopy shade trees. Shade tree species richness was most important for explaining variance in bird diversity. Our study shows that shaded cacao farms in western Panama provide habitat for a wide variety of resident and migratory bird species. Considering current land use trends in the region, we suggest that action must be taken to prevent conversion away from shaded cacao farms to land uses with lower biodiversity conservation value.},

Comparisons were made at each site over three time periods (1985-1987 [Phase I] and 1998-2000 [Phase II] [pre-construction], 2007-2009 [Phase III] [post-construction]) and at three distances (0, 100, 300 m) from the bridge or proposed bridge location. Overall, 70 songbirds and 10 small mammals were detected during the study. Cliff swallows (Petrochelidon pyrrhonota) and rock pigeons (Columba livia) showed high affinity for bridges (P ¡ 0.05). Combined small mammal abundances increased between Phases I and II (P ¡ 0.05), but did not differ between Phases II and III (P ¿ 0.05). Species richness and diversity for songbirds and small mammals did not differ before and after bridge construction (P ¿ 0.05). We found that most species sampled did not respond to the bridge crossing, and believe that the bridge is not causing any measurable negative density impacts to the species we investigated. The new bridge does provide habitat for exotic rock pigeons that are adjusted to man-made structures for nesting.},

  abstract = {The Landsat Burned Area Essential Climate Variable (BAECV), developed by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), capitalizes on the long temporal availability of Landsat imagery to identify burned areas across the conterminous United States (CONUS) (1984-2015). Adequate validation of such products is critical for their proper usage and interpretation. Validation of coarse-resolution products often relies on independent data derived from moderate resolution sensors (e.g., Landsat). Validation of Landsat products, in turn, is challenging because there is no corresponding source of high-resolution, multispectral imagery that has been systematically collected in space and time over the entire temporal extent of the Landsat archive. Because of this, comparison between high-resolution images and Landsat science products can help increase user's confidence in the Landsat science products, but may not, alone, be adequate. In this paper, we demonstrate an approach to systematically validate the Landsat-derived BAECV product. Burned area extent was mapped for Landsat image pairs using a manually trained semi-automated algorithm that was manually edited across 28 path/rows and five different years (1988,1993, 1998, 2003, 2008). Three datasets were independently developed by three analysts and the datasets were integrated on a pixel by pixel basis in which at least one to all three analysts were required to agree a pixel was burned. We found that errors within our Landsat reference dataset could be minimized by using the rendition of the dataset in which pixels were mapped as burned if at least two of the three analysts agreed. BAECV errors of omission and commission for the detection of burned pixels averaged 42\% and 33\%, respectively for CONUS across all five validation years. Errors of omission and commission were lowest across the western CONUS, for example in the shrub and scrublands of the Arid West (31\% and 24\%, respectively), and highest in the grasslands and agricultural lands of the Great Plains in central CONUS (62\% and 57\%, respectively). The BAECV product detected most (¿65\%) fire events ¿10 ha across the western CONUS (Arid and Mountain West ecoregions). Our approach and results demonstrate that a thorough validation of Landsat science products can be completed with independent Landsat-derived reference data, but could be strengthened by the use of complementary sources of high-resolution data.

The commercially available SICK Laser-Measurement-System-200 (LMS200, Sick, A.G.) was used in this study to obtain 3D structural datasets with high point densities. An artificial tree was constructed in an experimental set-up, thereby creating the possibility to arrange the structural key elements (leaves and branches) according to predetermined patterns. The multidirectional accuracy and quality of the laser measurement set-ups (lateral sideway, lateral bottom-up, hemispherical bottom-up) subsequently were compared based on the development of a mathematical description of each case. Vertical plant profiles were computed for the different experimental set-ups showing the direct influence of the vertical distribution pattern of the laser beams on the estimation of plant material in a certain height bin. The main measurement direction proved to have the biggest impact on the quality of the dataset, since the derived vertical profile followed the main trend of this laser beam distribution pattern. The use of probabilitybased statistics was necessary to correct the vertical profiles in order to obtain an acceptable estimation of the amount of plant material per height bin of 0.05 m.},

  abstract = {Objectives: Clinical trials in neurodegenerative disorders are facing high futility rates and rising development costs. We aim to review and exemplify the value of group sequential trial designs (i.e., designs with one or more prospectively planned interim analyses) within the field of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Study Design and Setting: We reviewed the literature to identify sequentially conducted trials. Subsequently, we reanalyzed the dexpramipexole trial (EMPOWER), a classically designed and conducted trial involving 942 participants, by sequentially monitoring the functional questionnaire and survival endpoint. Finally, we simulated the performance of the sequential methodology under different treatment effects. Results: Only six (12\%) randomized, placebo-controlled trials incorporated stopping rules for both futility and superiority. Despite its high enrollment rate, sequential reanalysis of the EMPOWER study reduced the total trial duration with 140 days (23.4\%, 95\% confidence interval [CI] 13.2e34.4\%), the number of follow-ups with 2,688 visits (23.6\%, 95\% CI 11.3e38.6\%), and the total drug exposure time with 73,377 days (20.6\%, 95\% CI 9.8e35.9\%). The functional questionnaire considerably increased the heterogeneity in the test statistics, which may negatively affect sequential monitoring. Conclusion: Group sequential trials can result in important reductions in the trial duration, which could make clinical trials more ethical by reducing the patients’ exposure to noneffective treatments or by limiting their time on placebo.

  abstract = {Numerous indicator approaches are found in the scientific literature to describe changes in biodiversity. It is however far from clear which indicators are most appropriate and which are less suitable to summarize trends in biodiversity. One reason for this lack of clarity is that so far the mathematical properties of indicator approaches have had little attention. In this paper, we derive a number of desirable mathematical properties of indicators from economic price-index theory and apply these in the form of tests to W metrics to summarize changes in biodiversity. The metrics species richness, Simpson index, Shannon index, Buckland's modified Shannon index and Sorensen's similarity coefficient violate the monotonicity and proportionality test. The percentage of increasing minus declining species also fails the proportionality test, and in the case where trends are assessed relative to the preceding year, this metric also violates the identity test. Most of these indicators are sensitive to spatial scale. The arithmetic and geometric mean of population indices and the mean abundance have better mathematical performance, but the first two are sensitive to appearing and disappearing species in the system surveyed. The metric mean abundance however can only be applied under particular conditions and has some undesirable properties. Unlike the arithmetic mean, the geometric mean is not sensitive to the base year chosen and has the most favourable mathematical properties of the indicators evaluated. The geometric mean can be straightforwardly extended to take into account unequal values of species if desired. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Temperate deciduous forests in South America are rapidly being replaced by pine plantations, causing changes in habitats for both breeding and migrant birds. We examined differences in avian species richness and abundance in three areas: a reserve with continuous tracts of native forest, forest fragments and pine plantations. Four species were negatively affected by fragmentation, with their abundance declining from continuous forest to pine plantations. Fourteen species were not affected by fragmentation and eight had significantly increased abundance in pine plantations compared to continuous forest. Overall abundance in pooled and ground/understorey birds was higher in forest fragments and pine plantations compared to continuous forest. The abundance of granivorous species was higher in the pine plantations than in the forest reserve, but the abundance of insectivorous species was higher in the forest reserve and in forest fragments than in pine plantations. Thus, forest fragmentation affects birds differentially according to their feeding ecology.},

These networks enable the capture of data perceived as necessary to evidence conservation strategies and foster public support. We collected interview and archival data from UK-based conservation organisations with regard to their use of digital technologies for wildlife monitoring. As a conceptual device to examine these efforts, we used Benedict Anderson's (1991) work on censuses, maps and museums as social instruments that enabled the imagining of communities. Through a critical application of this framework, the technologically-aided acquisition of wildlife data was shown to inform the new ways in which conservation organisations identify and quantify wildlife, conceptualise animal spaces, and curate conservation narratives. In so defining, delineating and displaying the non-human animal world with the backing of organisational authority, new technologies aid in the representational construction of animal censuses, maps and museums. In terms of practice, large amounts of new data can now be gathered and processed more cost-effectively. However, the use of technologies may also be the result of pressures on organisations to legitimise conservation by being seen as innovative and popular. Either way, human participants are relegated to supporting rather than participatory roles. At a more abstract level, the scale of surveillance associated with instrumentation can be read as an exercise of human dominance. Nonetheless, new technologies present conservation organisations with the means necessary for defending wildlife against exploitation. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

The Gatewing x 100 (TM) equipped with a Ricoh GR III camera was used to test animal reaction as the UAS passed, and visibility on the images. No reaction was recorded as the UAS passed at a height of 100 m. Observations, made on a set of more than 7000 images, revealed that only elephants (Loxodonta africana) were easily visible while medium and small sized mammals were not. The easy observation of elephants allows experts to enumerate them on images acquired at a height of 100 m. We, therefore, implemented an aerial strip sample count along transects used for the annual wildlife foot count. A total of 34 elephants were recorded on 4 transects, each overflown twice. The elephant density was estimated at 2.47 elephants/km(2) with a coefficient of variation (CV\%) of 36.10\%. The main drawback of our UAS was its low autonomy (45 min). Increased endurance of small UAS is required to replace manned aircraft survey of large areas (about 1000 km of transect per day vs 40 km for our UAS). The monitoring strategy should be adapted according to the sampling plan. Also, the UAS is as expensive as a second-hand light aircraft. However the logistic and flight implementation are easier, the running costs are lower and its use is safer. Technological evolution will make civil UAS more efficient, allowing them to compete with light aircraft for aerial wildlife surveys.},

Remote sensing tools that directly characterize three-dimensional (3-D) habitat structure and that provide data relevant to organism–habitat interactions across a hierarchy of scales promise to improve our understanding of animal–habitat relationships. Laser altimetry, commonly called light detection and ranging (lidar), is a source of geospatial data that can provide fine-grained information about the 3-D structure of ecosystems across broad spatial extents.

Regional population sizes were obtained by extrapolating transects' estimates to the Sandhills. Detection probabilities were high (¿0.75) for all species, but highest for Northern Shoveler (Anas clypeata) and Gadwall (A. strepera). Detection probabilities generally followed increases or decreases with duck densities. Uncorrected population estimates, on average, were ¡7\% the population estimates obtained by correcting for detectability. Double-observer methodology should be considered for adjusting duck counts that cannot be corrected using additional aerial or ground surveys, particularly where water and ducks are well dispersed.

  abstract = {Because rapidly expanding human populations have devastated gorilla (Gorilla gorilla) and common chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) habitats in East and West Africa, the relatively intact forests of western equatorial Africa have been viewed as the last stronghold of African apes(1). Gabon and the Republic of Congo alone are thought to hold roughly 80\% of the world's gorillas(2) and most of the common chimpanzees(1). Here we present survey results conservatively indicating that ape populations in Gabon declined by more than half between 1983 and 2000. The primary cause of the decline in ape numbers during this period was commercial hunting, facilitated by the rapid expansion of mechanized logging. Furthermore, Ebola haemorrhagic fever is currently spreading through ape populations in Gabon and Congo and now rivals hunting as a threat to apes. Gorillas and common chimpanzees should be elevated immediately to `critically endangered' status. Without aggressive investments in law enforcement, protected area management and Ebola prevention, the next decade will see our closest relatives pushed to the brink of extinction.}

  abstract = {1. A key element of African elephant conservation is monitoring how different forms of human activity influence elephant distribution and abundance. Information on human-elephant interaction is critical for guiding conservation action at all levels, from very local management interventions, through national protected area planning, to international policy initiatives such as the ban on ivory trade. However, methods for monitoring elephant numbers often produce rather poor estimate precision. Therefore, a major challenge for elephant monitoring programmes at all levels is to allocate survey effort efficiently: the greatest possible statistical power to detect the effects of particular forms of human activity must be obtained from limited survey effort. 2. This study examined an approach to survey design based on the assumption that the precision of an abundance estimate is directly proportional to sampling effort. Field data from three sites in Central Africa were used to evaluate the potential of this approach for projecting how much effort will be necessary to survey and monitor forest elephants. 3. Variance in elephant dung pile encounter rate was proportional to sampling effort, but variance was also influenced by mean encounter rate. The relationship between variance and mean encounter rate followed a power law more closely than the linear model suggested by many previous authors. The linear model tended to substantially underestimate the effort level required for areas with high encounter rates. A bootstrapping exercise suggested that modelling the precision-effort relationship across strata should produce more accurate projections than estimating a distinct precision-effort relationship for each stratum. 4. Our results suggest that the survey design framework examined could substantially improve the statistical power of forest elephant monitoring programmes, although the use of a power law (rather than linear) model seems preferable. A similar approach should be appropriate for designing savanna elephant monitoring programmes and for addressing other issues, including rates of hunting and human elephant conflict. Furthermore, the parameter estimates reported in this study should be useful in designing elephant survey and monitoring programmes at other forested sites in Central Africa.},

  abstract = {The decision by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) to condition a limited sale of ivory on the status of elephant poaching has brought into sharp focus the technical, organizational, and financial challenges inherent in setting up a continent-wide monitoring program. The task will be particularly arduous in central Africa, where forest elephant populations are difficult to monitor and the infrastructure necessary for population monitoring is lacking. The magnitude of effort that will be necessary is illustrated by an elephant survey done in the Gamba Complex, a network of protected areas on the southwest coast of Gabon. Implementing the survey required a large-scale program for training Gabonese nationals in field survey and analysis methods necessary for elephant monitoring. Field work carried out during the training program suggests that a combination of reconnaissance and line transects can product statistically valid population estimates for a substantially lower effort than line transects alone. We illustrate statistical frameworks for comparing the efficiency of alternative sampling methods, and we analyze the sensitivity of current survey methods, which can detect abundance changes on the order of 15\% given fairly high effort levels. Although these training and methodological results are encouraging, they are just small steps in a complex and ongoing process. We argue that this process has many parallels with what needs to be done if the international conservation community is to respond to the challenge set for it by the 1997 CITES meeting. There must be a concerted effort focused both on improving survey methods and on developing the human resources and on-the-ground infrastructure necessary to implement these methods.},

  abstract = {Game reserves (GR) in Tanzania have been found to support similar or lower densities of large mammals compared with National parks (NP). But as these areas usually differ considerably not only in regard to management but also to environmental factors, we assessed the relative importance of vegetation cover, species-specific habitat preferences and legal (trophy hunting) and illegal off-take for observed differences in species-specific densities. In the Katavi ecosystem, open habitats were characteristic elements of Katavi NP, while Rukwa GR was dominated by miombo forest. In an inter-specific comparison, density differences were moderately correlated with preferences for open habitats, and with estimates of combined legal and illegal off-take but not with one of these separately. In a multiple linear regression, open habitat preference was found to explain 39.6\% of the density differences between the two protected areas. This analysis suggests that the broad-scale pattern of most species' distributions is governed by differing vegetation cover but that several species are overexploited by illegal (elephant, giraffe, buffalo, bush pig, warthog) or combined off-take (hippopotamus, eland, waterbuck), thus emphasizing the need for quota readjustments and a more efficient anti-poaching control.},

  abstract = {Background:\hspace{0.6em} Plant height is an important morphological and developmental phenotype that directly indicates overall plant growth and is widely predictive of final grain yield and biomass. Currently, manually measuring plant height is laborious and has become a bottleneck for genetics and breeding programs. The goal of this research was to evaluate the performance of five different sensing technologies for field-based high throughput plant phenotyping (HTPP) of sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench] height. With this purpose, (1) an ultrasonic sensor, (2) a LIDAR-Lite v2 sensor, (3) a Kinect v2 camera, (4) an imaging array of four high-resolution cameras were evaluated on a ground vehicle platform, and (5) a digital camera was evaluated on an unmanned aerial vehicle platform to obtain the performance baselines to measure the plant height in the field. Plot-level height was extracted by averaging different percentiles of elevation observations within each plot. Measurements were taken on 80 single-row plots of a US\,×\,Chinese sorghum recombinant inbred line population. The performance of each sensing technology was also qualitatively evaluated through comparison of device cost, measurement resolution, and ease and efficiency of data analysis. Results:\hspace{0.6em} We found the heights measured by the ultrasonic sensor, the LIDAR-Lite v2 sensor, the Kinect v2 camera, and the imaging array had high correlation with the manual measurements (r\,≥\,0.90), while the heights measured by remote imaging had good, but relatively lower correlation to the manual measurements (r\,=\,0.73). Conclusion:\hspace{0.6em} These results confirmed the ability of the proposed methodologies for accurate and efficient HTPP of plant height and can be extended to a range of crops. The evaluation approach discussed here can guide the fieldbased HTPP research in general.},

  abstract = {Global changes are driving ecosystem alterations, and the effects are becoming more and more obvious. Ecosystem management clarifies the fundamental supporting functions of ecosystems for human survival and sustainable development. Integrated ecosystem monitoring and assessment has become a popular topic of ecology study. However, many scientific questions need to be addressed, including what assessment contents and methods are optimal for temporal and spatial measurements. Therefore, the development of a scientific evaluation framework that includes certain core contents and indicators is very important. This paper proposes a regional integrated ecosystem assessment framework involving comprehensive monitoring. Satellite images are the main data source for different ecosystem and ecological parameters, and these need to be supplemented with the help of surveys or field observation data. A healthy ecosystem is the basis of human survival and sustainable development, and ecological service should be taken as the core of integrated ecosystem assessment. This is decided by the spatial distribution, classification, and patterns of regional ecosystems. That is to say, ecological service, together with ecosystems distribution and pattern, ecological problem indicators, and ecological stress, needs to be integrated analyzed and evaluated.}

  abstract = {Background Increasingly, underwater visual censuses (UVC) are used to assess fish populations. Several studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of protected areas for increasing fish abundance or provided insight into the natural abundance and structure of reef fish communities in remote areas. Recently, high apex predator densities ({$>$}100,000 individuals·km−2) and biomasses ({$>$}4 tonnes·ha−1) have been reported for some remote islands suggesting the occurrence of inverted trophic biomass pyramids. However, few studies have critically evaluated the methods used for sampling conspicuous and highly mobile fish such as sharks. Ideally, UVC are done instantaneously, however, researchers often count animals that enter the survey area after the survey has started, thus performing non-instantaneous UVC. Methodology/Principal Findings We developed a simulation model to evaluate counts obtained by divers deploying non-instantaneous belt-transect and stationary-point-count techniques. We assessed how fish speed and survey procedure (visibility, diver speed, survey time and dimensions) affect observed fish counts. Results indicate that the bias caused by fish speed alone is huge, while survey procedures had varying effects. Because the fastest fishes tend to be the largest, the bias would have significant implications on their biomass contribution. Therefore, caution is needed when describing abundance, biomass, and community structure based on non-instantaneous UVC, especially for highly mobile species such as sharks. Conclusions/Significance Based on our results, we urge that published literature state explicitly whether instantaneous counts were made and that survey procedures be accounted for when non-instantaneous counts are used. Using published density and biomass values of communities that include sharks we explore the effect of this bias and suggest that further investigation may be needed to determine pristine shark abundances and the existence of inverted biomass pyramids. Because such studies are used to make important management and conservation decisions, incorrect estimates of animal abundance and biomass have serious and significant implications.},

  abstract = {Fire is both a widespread natural disturbance that affects the distribution of species and a tool that can be used to manage habitats for species. Knowledge of temporal changes in the occurrence of species after fire is essential for conservation management in fireprone environments. Two key issues are: whether postfire responses of species are idiosyncratic or if multiple species show a limited number of similar responses; and whether such responses to time since fire can predict the occurrence of species across broad spatial scales. We examined the response of bird species to time since fire in semiarid shrubland in southeastern Australia using data from surveys at 499 sites representing a 100-year chronosequence. We used nonlinear regression to model the probability of occurrence of 30 species with time since fire in two vegetation types, and compared species’ responses with generalized response shapes from the literature. The occurrence of 16 species was significantly influenced by time since fire: they displayed six main responses consistent with generalized response shapes. Of these 16 species, 15 occurred more frequently in mid- or later-successional vegetation (.20 years since fire), and only one species occurred more often in early succession (,5 years since fire). The models had reasonable predictive ability for eight species, some predictive ability for seven species, and were little better than random for one species. Bird species displayed a limited range of responses to time since fire; thus a small set of fire ages should allow the provision of habitat for most species. Postfire successional changes extend for decades and management of the age class distribution of vegetation will need to reflect this timescale. Response curves revealed important seral stages for species and highlighted the importance of mid- to late-successional vegetation (.20 years). Although time since fire clearly influences the distribution of numerous bird species, predictive models of the spatial distribution of species in fire-prone landscapes need to incorporate other factors in addition to time since fire.},

  abstract = {Predicting the response of faunal communities to fire presents a challenge for land managers worldwide because the post-fire responses of species may vary between locations and fire events. Post-fire recovery can occur via nucleated recovery from in situ surviving populations or by colonization from ex situ populations. Finescale spatial patterns in the patchiness of fires and the proximity of burnt sites to source populations may contribute to both the variability in post-fire responses and the processes by which populations recover. We examined the avifauna at recently burnt sites within extensive semi-arid shrublands of south-eastern Australia, including 72 sites {$<$} 5 years since fire and 26 sites 10 years since fire. Study sites represented a gradient of increasing distance from ‘unburnt’ vegetation (i.e. {$>$} 27 years since fire) and varied in the presence or absence of small (25–900 m2) unburnt patches of vegetation. For sites {$<$} 5 years since fire, species richness was higher at sites closer to unburnt vegetation and at sites containing unburnt patches. These patterns were no longer evident at sites of 10 years since fire. The probability of occurrence of three of seven bird species modelled decreased with increasing distance to unburnt vegetation, but this pattern was evident only at sites burnt uniformly. One species was found almost exclusively at patchily burnt sites. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that proximity to unburnt vegetation enhances post-fire occupancy, and that colonization from ex situ populations is an important process for post-fire recovery of avifauna. Additionally, small unburnt patches enhance the rapid recovery of assemblages post-fire. These patterns are important for understanding the dynamics of post-fire population recovery. We recommend that management of fire for ecological purposes should explicitly consider the role that the spatial attributes of fires play in determining the post-fire community.},

  abstract = {Bird surveys are among the most widely used biodiversity inventories and serve as the basis for an increasing proportion of pure and applied ecological research. It is rarely possible to conduct exhaustive censuses of all individuals present at a particular site, so stopping rules are routinely used to determine when sampling should finish. Most bird survey methods use (implicit) effort-based stopping rules, either fixed times, fixed sampling areas (quadrats) or both, to standardize samples of different sites. If between-site variation is high, however, a fixed sampling effort will generate samples of variable completeness with samples from smaller, less complex sites being more representative and complete than samples from larger, more complex sites. More importantly, quadrat-based methods shift the scope of the overall study from bird occurrence in sites to bird occurrence in quadrats within sites, diminishing the impact of the research given that results cannot be extrapolated to relevant biological and management scales. Here I advocate an alternative means of conducting bird surveys, whereby the entire site is sampled and a results-based stopping rule is used to ensure sample completeness is uniform across all sites. For example, a researcher may decide to continue sampling each site until two or fewer previously unencountered species are recorded in a 40-min period. Samples of different sites will vary in both area and duration but will all be equivalently accurate estimates of species richness. This approach allows the avifauna of entire sites (whether territories, woodland remnants or catchments) to be sampled and compared directly, generating results and implications at the appropriate scale. In addition to yielding reliable measures of species richness, data collected this way can be used to calculate estimates of sample completeness and species incidence, two valuable metrics for ecological studies. This paper includes detailed worked examples of how to conduct a `standardized search' and calculate sample completeness and species incidence estimates. I encourage further research on bird survey methods, and suggest that most current methods are insufficient, inconsistent and unreliable.},

  abstract = {Aim Most approaches to conservation prioritization are focused on biodiversity features that are already threatened. While this is necessary in the face of accelerating anthropogenic threats, there have been calls to conserve large intact landscapes, often termed 'wilderness', to ensure the long-term persistence of biodiversity. In this study, we examine the consequences of directing conservation expenditure using a threat-based framework for wilderness conservation. Location The Australian continent. Methods We measured the degree of congruence between the extent of wilderness and the Australian protected area network in 2000 and 2006, which was established using a threat-based systematic planning framework. We also assessed priority areas for future reserve acquisitions identified by the Australian government under the current framework. Results In 2000, 14\% of Australia's wilderness was under formal protection, while the protected area network covered only 8.5\% of the continent, suggesting a historical bias towards wilderness protection. However, the expansion of the reserve system from 2000 to 2006 was biased towards non-wilderness areas. Moreover, 90\% of the wilderness that was protected over this period comprised areas not primarily designated for biodiversity conservation. We found a significant (P {$<$} 0.05) negative relationship between bioregions considered to be a priority for future reserve prioritization and the amount of wilderness they contain. Main conclusions While there is an urgent need to overcome past biases in reserve network design so as to better protect poorly represented species and habitats, prioritization approaches should not become so reactive as to ignore the role that large, intact landscapes play in conserving biodiversity, especially in a time of human-induced climate change. This can be achieved by using current or future threats rather than past threats to prioritize areas, and by incorporating key ecological processes and costs of acquisition and management within the planning framework.},

If the transformed expectation f (μ) is to be estimated by f X¯ n then the delta method is a widely used tool to describe the asymptotic behaviour of f X¯ n . Regarding bias and variance, however, conventional theorems require independent observations as well as boundedness conditions of f being violated even by “simple” functions such as roots or logarithms. It is shown that asymptotic expansions for bias and variance still hold if restrictive boundedness conditions are replaced by considerably weaker requirements upon the global growth of f . Moreover, observations are allowed to be dependent.},

  abstract = {Maryland's Green Infrastructure (GI) is a network of large, intact natural areas (hubs), interconnected by linear swaths of riparian or upland vegetation (corridors). The GI serves significant ecological functions and provides the bulk of the state's natural support system. This study examined whether the GI as mapped does, in fact, identify Maryland's most ecologically valuable forested lands, using forest interior dwelling birds (hereafter called “forest birds”) as bio-indicators. We conducted bird point counts within forest both inside and outside of hubs on Maryland's Eastern Shore. We also collected a wide variety of habitat data. We found that both the condition of a forest and its surrounding landscape influenced the bird communities. On average, forest bird richness was significantly higher within hubs; furthermore, almost all sites with at least five forest bird species present were in hubs. Forest bird richness and abundance were highest in undisturbed, mature broadleaf forest with wetlands and streams nearby. We detected a significant relationship between forest bird richness and the ecological score of a finer-scale landscape assessment, focused on “cells” of about 0.1 ha in size. This field study also validated the Rapid Field Assessment (RFA) protocol developed in 2001 to assess, on the ground, the relative condition of individual sites or properties within the GI. Forest bird richness and abundance were positively correlated with the RFA community scores. Our results underscore the importance of maintaining regional biological diversity by retaining large blocks of forest, especially mature forest containing streams and wetlands.},

The typical neotropical rainforest tour package offered by ecolodges aimed at bird tour groups is a three-day, three-night package. Assuming birders and bird tour groups seek to maximise the number of new bird species observed each day a Monte Carlo simulation of diminishing returns using birder's lists available at www.Birding.com suggests diminishing returns occur only on the fifth day.

  abstract = {Researchers have indexed abundance of the northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus, hereafter, bobwhite) during autumn by counting the number of coveys heard during early morning call surveys. However, critical assumptions about call rates, survey timing, and seasonality have not been tested, and the effects of weather and bobwhite density on call rates are unknown. Therefore, we quantified covey-calling activity of 219 radiomarked coveys at 5 sites during September-December 1997-1999 to assess the effects of these variables. Across all sites, the average proportion of coveys that called prior to leaving the roost site was 58\% (range = 48-87\%). Coveys began calling 23.4 +/- 0.5 ((x) over bar +/- SE) min before sunrise, and they produced 31.4 +/- 1.9 calls/call event; most calls (87\%) occurred 35-15 min before sunrise. Using data collected in 1998, we fit 15 logistic regression models to predict the probability of a covey calling. The selected best model (Akaike weight [w] = 0.48) included variables for the number of adjacent calling coveys, wind speed, cloud cover, and barometric pressure change with number of adjacent calling coveys having the greatest effect on covey calling (odds ratio of 1.4). A less parsimonious model, which also included biweekly periods and interaction terms, was potentially as likely (w = 0.41) as the selected model, with the 16-31 October biweekly period having most effect (odds ratio of 1.8) over other biweekly periods. We tested selected best models using observations collected in 1999 from 2 of the sites monitored in 1998. During peak calling periods, predicted call rates were ¡0.06 from observed covey-call rates. Given the accuracy of predicted call rates, we recommend adjusting covey-call counts by an estimated calling rate to better measure fall bobwhite abundance.},

  abstract = {When designing large-scale bird monitoring schemes, financial constraints often require researchers to make trade-offs in the spatial resolution and precision of the density estimates by varying the number of sites monitored and the intensity of sampling effort per site. Here, I compare density estimates of four common farmland bird species (skylark, blackbird, song thrush, Australasian magpie) on South Island sheep \& beef farms collected using a large-scale monitoring scheme with equivalent estimates from a more intensive survey, and discuss possible sources of imprecision and bias in each. Density estimates from the intensive survey were generally lower and more precise than the monitoring-scheme ones, and the surveys were susceptible to different types of bias. These effects were linked to combined differences in modelling methods and sampling effort distribution, and to observer-related issues. In long-term designs, estimates from data pooled over several annual surveys are likely to become accurate quickly, but an increase in monitoring effort per site may be required to increase the precision of individual-survey estimates. Species that pose challenges to observers may be hard to estimate accurately with the monitoring-scheme design explored here, and the use of pilot surveys is recommended. Raw count data from the same species were tested for their usefulness in the creation of reliable relative population indices. A sufficiently constant ratio of plot-count indices to absolute density estimates was found in skylarks and thrushes, while inclusion of a correction parameter to account for woody vegetation effects on detectability was necessary in blackbirds, and magpie estimates proved unreliable. Similar analyses are recommended for all monitored species when trend estimation using relative indices is intended.},

Advanced remote sensing technologies provide data to assist in addressing these escalating information needs and to support the subsequent development and parameterization of models for an even broader range of information needs. This special issue contains papers that use a variety of remote sensing technologies to derive forest inventory or inventory-related information. Herein, we review the potential of 4 advanced remote sensing technologies, which we posit as having the greatest potential to influence forest inventories designed to characterize forest resource information for strategic, tactical, and operational planning: airborne laser scanning (ALS), terrestrial laser scanning (TLS), digital aerial photogrammetry (DAP), and high spatial resolution (HSR)/very high spatial resolution (VHSR) satellite optical imagery. ALS, in particular, has proven to be a transformative technology, offering forest inventories the required spatial detail and accuracy across large areas and a diverse range of forest types. The coupling of DAP with ALS technologies will likely have the greatest impact on forest inventory practices in the next decade, providing capacity for a broader suite of attributes, as well as for monitoring growth over time.},

The mercury vapor trap is often powered by a heavy automotive battery making it difficult to conduct extensive surveys in remote regions. The mercury vapor trap also carries a considerable financial cost per trap unit, making trapping challenging with low research budgets. Here, we describe the development and trapping properties of a lighter, simply constructed, and less expensive trap. The LED funnel trap consists of a funnel, soda bottles with plastic vanes, and is powered by rechargeable 9-V batteries. Two strips of low-wavelength LEDs are used as attractants. We tested the trapping parameters of this trap design compared to a standard mercury vapor trap over 10 trap nights in a suburban woodlot in the summer of 2015. The mercury vapor trap caught significantly more moth individuals than the LED trap (average of 78 vs 40 moths per trap night; P¡0.05), and significantly more species than the LED trap (23 vs 15 per trap night; P¡0.05); the mercury vapor trap caught a total of 104 macromoth species over the duration of the study, compared to a total of 87 by the LED trap. Despite the lower yields, the low cost of the LED trap (¡\$30 ea.) makes it superior to the mercury vapor trap in cost-acquisition per moth species and per moth individual trapped. The LED trap may be a viable alternative to the standard mercury vapor trap, facilitating insect trapping in more diverse settings.},

Our objectives were to build a model to describe the status of waterbirds in Glacier Bay National Park, Alaska, USA, and assess effects of area closures on these species. We used a Bayesian multistate occupancy model to describe the status of multiple species and make the best possible use of existing survey data. We modeled up to 5 states per species and evaluated predictors of occupancy, nesting, and abundance, as well as survey-related predictors of state-dependent detection probability. We found that occupancy probability varied across species and habitats (islands vs. glacial outwashes). For most species, occupancy probability was substantially greater at sites occupied in the year previous (site persistence). We found weak evidence that area closures affected the occurrence of species in the study, but this was largely because most sites were closed for the entirety of the study period. The probability of detecting occurrence, nesting, and abundance varied across species and survey methods (ground vs. vessel). Detection parameters provided valuable information for enhancing the efficiency of future surveys, by identifying preferred survey methods and sampling periods for specific waterbird species.

We conducted a line transect distance sampling aerial survey of KB polar bears during 28 April-12 May 2014. A total of 4160 linear kilometers were flown in a helicopter over fast ice in the fjords and over offshore pack ice between 76 degrees 50 ' and 80 degrees N '. Using a mark-recapture distance sampling protocol, the estimated abundance was 190 bears (95\% lognormal CI: 87-411; CV 39\%). This estimate is likely negatively biased to an unknown degree because the offshore sectors of the NOW with much open water were not surveyed because of logistical and safety reasons. Our study demonstrated that aerial surveys may be a feasible method for obtaining abundance estimates for small subpopulations of polar bears.},

The key random component in the conditional mean function from this distribution is then a spatio-temporal dynamic process. Given the computational burden of estimating the expected utility of various designs in this setting, we utilize an extended Kalman filter approximation to facilitate implementation.

Government and donor investments currently meet less than 30 per cent of the estimated recurring costs required to manage the protected-area network within central African countries effectively, and cover none of the growing opportunity costs incurred to maintain protected areas. Unfortunately, few additional sources of funding are available. Tourism is only economically viable where charismatic species exist in `safe' areas that are not more than a few hours drive in a 4x4 vehicle from an international airport-ostensibly excluding tourism from most of central Africa. In contrast, a review of available information suggests that safari hunting could offer a significant and sustainable source of financing to offset some of the costs of maintaining protected areas in central Africa. However, better quantitative data are needed to assess whether trophy hunting is both ecologically sustainable and economically competitive over the long term relative to other land uses.},

  abstract = {Unsustainable hunting of wildlife for food is often a more immediate and significant threat to the conservation of biological diversity in tropical forests than deforestation. Why people eat wildlife is debated. Some may eat bushmeat because they can afford it; others may eat it because it is familiar, traditional, confers prestige, tastes good, or adds variety. We completed a survey of 1208 rural and urban households in Gabon, Africa, in 2002-2003 to estimate the effect of wealth and prices on the consumption of wildlife and other sources of animal protein. Consumption of bushmeat, fish, chicken, and livestock increased with increasing household wealth, and as the price of these commodities rose, consumption declined. Although the prices of substitutes for bushmeat did not significantly, in statistical terms, influence bushmeat consumption, as the price of wildlife increased and its consumption fell, the consumption of fish rose, indicating that fish and bushmeat were dietary substitutes. Our results suggest that policy makers can use economic levers such as taxation or supply reduction through better law enforcement to change demand for wildlife. These measures will help to regulate unsustainable exploitation and reduce the risk of irreversible loss of large-bodied and slow-reproducing wildlife species. If policy makers focus solely on reducing the unsustainable consumption of wildlife, they may see adverse impacts on the exploitation of fish. Furthermore, policy makers must ensure that raising household wealth through development assistance does not result in undesirable impacts on the conservation status of wildlife and fish.},

  abstract = {Coarse woody debris (CWD) plays an important role in many terrestrial and aquatic ecosystem processes. In recent years, a number of new methods have been proposed to sample CWD. Of these methods, perpendicular distance sampling (PDS) is one of the most efficient methods for estimating CWD volume in terms of both estimator variance and field effort. This study extends the results for PDS to the estimation of the surface area of CWD. The PDS estimator is also compared to two line intersect sampling (LIS) estimators, where one of the LIS estimators requires the measurement of surface area on each log and the other estimates surface area using a single measurement of log circumference at the point of intersection between the log and the line. The first estimator approximates the true surface area by assuming either a conic or parabolic stem form and requires measurements of the end diameters of each log, which is more time consuming than a single measurement. The performance of the three estimators was compared using a computer simulation. The results of the simulation indicate that, given the same number of pieces of CWD sampled at each point, equal variances can be achieved with PDS using sample sizes that range from about 10\% to in excess of 100\% the size of a comparable LIS estimator. When the LIS estimators were compared, the estimator that required the measurement of surface area was only about 3\%-6\% more efficient than the alternative estimator, but the bias associated with assuming a conic or parabolic stem form ranged from roughly 5\% to 15\%. We conclude that PDS will generally outperform either of the LIS estimators. Another important conclusion is that the LIS estimator based on a measured surface area is likely to have a higher mean squared error than an LIS estimator that employs a single measurement of circumference. Thus, LIS sampling strategies that require the least amount of field work will often have the smallest mean square error.},

  abstract = {Estimating detection error, as well as the magnitude of other potential survey biases, is essential when sampling efforts play a role in the estimation of population size and management of wildlife populations. We quantified visual biases in aerial surveys of nesting wading birds (Ciconiiformes) in colonies in the Florida Everglades using a negative binomial count regression model to compare numbers of nests in quadrats counted on the ground with numbers estimated from aerial photographs of the same quadrats. The model also allowed the determination of degree of difference between monitoring results based upon such factors as nest density, vegetative cover, and nest turnover rates. Aerial surveys of White Ibis (Eudocimus albus) colonies underestimated the true number of nests found during ground counts by 11.1\%, and underestimates were significantly greater (P = 0.047) in a colony with high nest turnover. Error rates did not differ for quadrats that varied in the density of White Ibis nests did not differ, and visual bias did not increase with vegetative complexity (P = 0.73). Estimates of nest density in colonies of Great Egrets (Ardea alba) based on aerial surveys were higher than ground counts for 38\% of the quadrats sampled, and mean visual bias was 23.1\%. Species misidentification likely contributed to visibility bias for Great Egrets in our study, with some Snowy Egrets almost certainly mistaken for Great Egrets in aerial photos. Biases of the magnitude we observed fro Great Egrets and White Ibises can mask true population trends in long-term monitoring and, therefore, we recommend that detection probability be explicitly evaluated when conducting aerial surveys of nesting birds.},

  abstract = {Information on animal abundance and distribution is at the cornerstone of many wildlife and conservation strategies. However, these data can be difficult and costly to obtain for cetacean species. The expense of sufficient ship time to conduct design-unbiased line transect surveys may be simply out of reach for researchers in many countries, which nonetheless grapple with problems of conservation of endangered species, by-catch of small cetaceans in commercial fisheries, and progression toward ecosystem-based fisheries management. Recently developed spatial modeling techniques show promise for estimating wildlife abundance using non-randomized surveys, but have yet to receive much field-testing in areas where designed surveys have also been conducted. Effort and sightings data were collected along 9 650 km of transects aboard ships of opportunity in the Southern Ocean during the austral summers of 2000 - 2001 and 2001 - 2002. Generalized additive models with generalized cross-validation were used to express heterogeneity of cetacean sightings as functions of spatial covariates. Models were used to map predicted densities and to estimate abundance of humpback, minke, and fin whales in the Drake Passage and along the Antarctic Peninsula. All species' distribution maps showed strong density gradients, which were robust to jackknife resampling when each of 14 trips was removed sequentially with replacement. Looped animations of model predictions of whale density illustrate uncertainty in distribution estimates in a way that is informative to non-scientists. The best abundance estimate for humpback whales was 1 829 (95\% CI: 978- 3 422). Abundance of fin whales was 4 487 ( 95\% CI: 1 326 - 15 179) and minke whales was 1,544 ( 95\% CI: 1,221 - 1,953). These estimates agreed roughly with those reported from a designed survey conducted in the region during the previous austral summer. These estimates assumed that all animals on the trackline were detected, but preliminary results suggest that any negative bias due to violation of this assumption was likely small. Similarly, current methodological limitations prohibit inclusion of all known sources of uncertainty in the favored variance estimator. Meanwhile, our approach can be seen generally as an inexpensive pilot study to identify areas of predicted high density that could be targeted to: inform stratified designs for future line transect surveys, making them less expensive and more precise; increase efficiency of future photo-identification or biopsy studies; identify candidate time-area fisheries closures to minimize by-catch; or direct ecotourism activities. The techniques are likely to apply to areas where funding is limiting, where cetacean studies or wilderness-based tourism are just beginning, or in regions where even a very rough estimate of animal abundance is needed for conservation or management purposes.},

  abstract = {Indices of abundance, such as point counts, commonly are used to monitor trends in bird populations. In some circumstances, however, an index of abundance provides insufficient information for making management decisions and accurate density estimates are necessary. Wild ring-necked pheasants (Phasianus colchicus) were translocated to 10 study areas in Pennsylvania from 2007 to 2014 with the goal of establishing female densities of 3.86 pheasants/km(2). We developed a population density estimator that used 3-minute crowing counts adjusted for probability of detection to estimate male pheasant density and flushing surveys to estimate the female:male ratio. To account for detection probability, we estimated the probability a pheasant was available to be detected by monitoring crowing frequency of male pheasants fitted with radio-transmitters and the probability an observer was able to detect a crowing pheasant at distances from 0 to 0.93km. We found the probability a pheasant crowed during 3 minutes decreased linearly over our survey period from 0.66 in mid-April to 0.46 by the end of May. At the farthest distance we were able to accurately detect a crowing pheasant. We estimated the probability of detecting a pheasant at 0.80km to be 0.0190 +/- 005 (SE), which means that we could not assume any fixed distance beyond which crowing birds could not be detected. Therefore, we replaced the probability of detection in the standard distance sampling estimator with the effective area of detection. The estimation of the effective area of detection is robust to choice of radius of the point and did not require observers to estimate the distance to crowing pheasants. We estimated the female:male ratio to be 1.02:1, despite the ratio of released pheasants being 4.46:1. Only 1 study area achieved the female density goal ((D) over cap =4.16); the maximum density at all other study areas was ¡2 females/km(2). The estimator we developed incorporated multiple detection probabilities to provide density estimates and simplified the crowing count protocol by eliminating the need for observers to estimate their distance from a detected bird, which makes the estimator useful for estimation of population abundance when explicit population density objectives must be evaluated.

We propose that combining bioacoustic monitoring with unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) technology could reduce some of these biases and allow bird surveys to be conducted in less accessible areas. We tested the feasibility of the UAV approach to songbird surveys using a low-cost quadcopter with a simple, lightweight recorder suspended 8 m below the vehicle. In a field experiment using playback of bird recordings, we found that small variations in UAV altitude (it hovered at 28, 48, and 68 m) didn't have a significant effect on detections by the recorder attached to the UAV, and we found that the detection radius of our equipment was comparable with detection radii of standard point counts. We then field tested our equipment, comparing songbird detections from our UAV-mounted recorder with standard point-count data from 51 count stations. We found that the number of birds per point on UAV counts was comparable with standard counts for most species, but there were significant underestimates for some-specifically, issues of song masking for a species with a low-frequency song, the Mourning Dove (Zenaida macroura); and underestimation of the abundance of a species that was found in very high densities, the Gray Catbird (Dumetella carolinensis). Species richness was lower on UAV counts (mean = 5.6 species point(-1)) than on standard counts (8.3 species point (-1)), but only slightly lower than on standard counts if nonaudible detections are omitted (6.5 species point (-1)). Excessive UAV noise is a major hurdle to using UAVs for bioacoustic monitoring, but we are optimistic that technological innovations to reduce motor and rotor noise will significantly reduce this issue. We conclude that UAV-based bioacoustic monitoring holds great promise, and we urge other researchers to consider further experimentation to refine techniques.},

Our objective was to determine patterns of habitat use by bitterns (Ardeidae) and rails (Rallidae), “secretive marsh birds,” in relation to habitat structure within and among moist-soil wetlands during spring and fall migration in Kansas. We used call-playback (spring) and flush counts (fall) to survey birds. Of our target species, only American Bittern (Botaurus lentiginosus), Least Bittern (Ixobrychus exilis), Virginia Rail (Rallus limicola), and Sora (Porzana carolina) were detected. Abundances varied markedly between years of our study (2014 and 2015), perhaps because of annual variation in precipitation or drawdown timings. In spring, Sora were found in wetland units with relatively tall Polygonum. No other significant habitat-use patterns were found for other species among wetland units in spring or for any species during fall migration. At the microhabitat scale (within wetlands) during fall, American Bittern and Sora were detected at points of less bare ground, lower grass cover, and greater water cover and depth than systematic sampling points along survey transects. American Bitterns were detected in microhabitats with higher cattail (Typha spp.) cover and height than Sora locations or systematic sampling points along survey transects. Sora were detected in microhabitats with greater Polygonum spp. cover and height and deeper water than American Bittern locations or habitat sampling points along transects. Among years and within wetlands, marsh birds in moist-soil managed wetlands were associated with thick standing vegetation and water, which are likely affected by drawdown timing.},

  abstract = {The abundance of nesting eagles is often identified as the parameter of primary interest for monitoring their populations. We compared the standard dual-frame estimator, which is recommended in the bald eagle post-delisting monitoring plan, with a Bayesian multistate capture-recapture approach to estimate the total number and number of active nests (nests with incubating adults) along the remote Kenai Fjords National Park coastline from 2009 to 2012. Two independent observers conducted aerial surveys of random transects during peak nest initiation in May. Both methods produced similar estimates of nest abundance, but the Bayesian multistate model allowed more flexibility to accommodate shifting management priorities. Estimates of the total number of nests and the number of active nests increased by approximately 49\% between 2009 and 2012. This increase was much greater than expected based on feasible rates of nest loss and creation for our study area, indicating apparent estimator bias. Survey-specific conditions (e.g., aircraft height) that made some nests unavailable to both observers were the most likely cause of the bias. We recommend that bald eagle nest monitoring include 2 surveys during the early breeding season to reduce bias of annual capture-recapture estimators. Our results demonstrate that incomplete availability may be an important source of bias for many double-observer aerial wildlife surveys. Published 2014.

  abstract = {Wildlife surveys often seek to determine the presence or absence of species at sites. Such data may be used in population monitoring, impact assessment, and species– habitat analyses. An implicit assumption of presence/absence surveys is that if a species is not detected in one or more visits to a site, it is absent from that site. However, it is rarely if ever possible to be completely sure that a species is absent, and false negative observation errors may arise when detection probabilities are less than 1. The detectability of species in wildlife surveys is one of the most important sources of uncertainty in determining the proportion of a landscape that is occupied by a species. Recent studies emphasize the need to acknowledge and incorporate false negative observation error rates in the analysis of site occupancy data, although a comparative study of the range of available methods for estimating detectability and occupancy is notably absent. The motivation for this study stems from the lack of guidance in the literature about the relative merits of alternative methods for estimating detection probabilities and site occupancy proportions from presence/absence survey data. Six approaches to estimating underlying detection probabilities and the proportion of sites occupied from binary observation data are reviewed. These include three parametric methods based on binomial mixtures, one nonparametric approach based on mark–recapture theory, and two approaches based on simplistic assumptions about occupancy rates. We compare the performance of each method using simulated data for which the “true” underlying detection rate is known. Simulated data were realized from a beta-binomial distribution, incorporating a realistic level of variation in detection rates. Estimation methods varied in their precision and bias. The “binomial-with-added-zeros” mixture model, estimated by maximum likelihood, was the least biased estimator of detection probability and, therefore, occupancy rate. We provide an Excel spreadsheet to execute all of the methods reviewed. Stand-alone programs such as PRESENCE may be used to estimate all models including the “binomial with added zeros” model. Our findings lend support to the use of maximum likelihood methods in estimating site occupancy and detectability rates.},

However, no ungulate monitoring methods is entirely satisfying in terms of cost-effectiveness and accuracy. A new method combining unmanned aerial vehicles (drones) and thermal infrared (TIR) imaging may have great potential as a tool for ungulate surveys. Drones enable safe operations at low flying altitudes, and at night - a time that often offers the optimal conditions for wildlife monitoring. To assess the feasibility of the proposed method we used fixed-wing drones with TIR cameras to conduct test surveys in Drawieski National Park, Poland. We demonstrated that ungulate thermal signatures are visible both in leafless deciduous and in pine-dominated coniferous forests. Survey timing highly influenced the results - the best quality thermal images were obtained at sunrise, late evening, and at night. Our preliminary results indicated that thermal surveys from drones are a promising method for ungulate enumeration. We demonstrated that with ground resolution of similar to 10cm it is possible to visibly distinguish large species (i.e. red deer) and achieve a good level of area coverage. The main challenges of the method are difficulties in species identification due to relatively low resolution of TIR cameras, regulations limiting drone operations to visual line of sight, and high dependence on weather.},

I examined daily temporal variation in detectability of a bird community during the dry season in a lowland Bolivian forestry concession. Whether analyzed by family, foraging guild or by sensitivity to habitat disturbance, the detectabibty of birds varied considerably across five one-hour census periods. The greatest number of birds (similar to 70\%) was detected in surveys during the first two hours following sunrise. Pre-sunrise and pre- and post-dusk surveys were important for detecting several families, including Tinamidae, Cracidae, Odontophoridae, Falconidae, Strigidae, Caprimulgidae, Momotidae, Furnariidae, and Dendrocolaptidae. Among ecological guilds identified by diet and forest stratum, most diet groups contained at least one guild that was proportionately more detectable during times not typically surveyed in other studies. Birds considered highly sensitive to habitat fragmentation were detected proportionately more frequently in pre-sunrise surveys than birds with medium or low sensitivity. Nocturnal and pre-dusk surveys can contribute considerably to estimates of bird density and relative abundance, and should at least be explored in all tropical forest bird community studies.},

  abstract = {Conventional surveys designed to monitor common and widespread species may fail to adequately track population changes of rare or patchily distributed species that are often of high conservation concern. We evaluated the performance of a new monitoring approach that employs both a spatially balanced sampling design and a targeted survey protocol designed to estimate population trends of one such patchily distributed species, the Golden-winged Warbler (Vermivora chrysoptera), in the Appalachian Mountains Bird Conservation Region (BCR 28), USA. Our spatially balanced survey consisted of 105 sample quads (one-quarter Delorme Atlas pages) across the current range of Golden-winged Warblers within BCR 28, each with five sample points located in early successional habitat. From 2009 to 2013, collaborators visited each sample point once per year during the peak breeding season and conducted a 17-min survey consisting of passive observation and playback of conspecific songs and mobbing vocalizations. We used multi-season, single-species occupancy models to estimate probability of quad occupancy, detection probability, and occupancy dynamics for Golden-winged Warblers and closely related Blue-winged Warblers (Vermivora cyanoptera). Our survey protocol resulted in high estimates of detection probability for Golden-winged (92\%) and Blue-winged (79\%) warblers, with 47\% and 56\% of quads estimated to be initially occupied, respectively. Derived population trend estimates () indicated an average decline in population of 6\% for Golden-winged Warblers and 7\% for Blue-winged Warblers, resulting in estimated 21\% and 22\% declines, respectively, in quad occupancy after 5yr. Our results demonstrate that coupling a spatially balanced survey design in appropriate habitat with a playback protocol to increase detection rates is a viable strategy for tracking populations of Golden-winged Warblers in the Appalachian Mountains BCR. Similar survey methods should be considered for other rare, declining, or patchily distributed bird species that require targeted monitoring.},

  abstract = {The Countryside Survey (CS) of Great Britain provides a globally unique series of datasets, consisting of an extensive set of repeated ecological measurements at a national scale, covering a time span of 29 years. CS was first undertaken in 1978 to monitor ecological and land use change in Britain using standardised procedures for recording ecological data from representative 1 km squares throughout the country. The same sites, with some additional squares, were used for subsequent surveys of vegetation undertaken in 1990, 1998 and 2007, with the intention of future surveys. Other data records include soils, freshwater habitats and invertebrates, and land cover and landscape feature diversity and extents. These data have been recorded in the same locations on analogous dates. However, the present paper describes only the details of the vegetation surveys.},

  abstract = {Over the last decades, large-scale ecological projects have emerged that require collecting ecological data over broad spatial and temporal coverage. Yet, obtaining relevant information about large-scale population dynamics from a single monitoring programme is challenging, and often several sources of data, possibly heterogeneous, need to be integrated. In this context, integrated models combine multiple data types into a single analysis to quantify the population dynamics of a targeted population. When working at large geographical scales, integrated spatial models have the potential to produce spatialized ecological estimates that would be difficult to obtain if data were analysed separately. In this study, we illustrate how spatial integrated modelling offers a relevant framework for conducting ecological inference at large scales. Focusing on the Mediterranean bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus), we combined 21,464 km of photo-identification boat surveys collecting spatial capture-recapture data with 24,624 km of aerial line transect following a distance sampling protocol. We analysed spatial capture-recapture data together with distance sampling data to estimate the abundance and density of bottlenose dolphins. We compared the performances of the distance sampling model and the spatial capture-recapture model fitted independently to our integrated spatial model. The outputs of our spatial integrated models inform bottlenose dolphin ecological status in the French Mediterranean Sea and provide ecological indicators that are required for regional-scale ecological assessments like the EU Marine Strategy Framework Directive. We argue that integrated spatial models are widely applicable and relevant to conservation research and biodiversity assessment at large spatial scales.},

  abstract = {Aerial vehicles equipped with infrared thermal sensors facilitate quick density estimates of wildlife, but detection error can arise from the thermal sensor and viewer of the infrared video. We reviewed published research to determine how commonly these sources of error have been assessed in studies using infrared video from aerial platforms to sample wildlife. The number of annual articles pertaining to aerial sampling using infrared thermography has increased drastically since 2018, but past studies inconsistently assessed sources of imperfect detection. We illustrate the importance of accounting for some of these types of error in a case study on white-tailed deer Odocoileus virginianus in Indiana, USA, using a simple double-observer approach. In our case study, we found evidence of false negatives associated with the viewer of infrared video. Additionally, we found that concordance between the detections of two viewers increased when using a red-green-blue camera paired with the infrared thermal sensor, when altitude decreased and when more stringent criteria were used to classify thermal signatures as deer. We encourage future managers and ecologists recording infrared video from aerial platforms to use double-observer methods to account for viewer-induced false negatives when video is manually viewed by humans. We also recommend combining infrared video with red-green-blue video to reduce false positives, applying stringent verification standards to detections in infrared and red-green-blue video and collecting data at lower altitudes over snow when needed.},

In habitats where direct observation is difficult (rain forests, oceans), or for cryptic species (shy, nocturnal), passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) provides cost-effective, unbiased data collection. PAM has broad applicability in terrestrial environments, particularly tropical rain forests. Using examples from studies of forest elephants in Central African rain forest, we show how PAM can be used to investigate cryptic behaviour, mechanisms of communication, estimate population size, quantify threats, and assess the efficacy of conservation strategies. We discuss the methodologies, requirements, and challenges of obtaining these data using acoustics. Where applicable, we compare these methods to more traditional approaches. While PAM methods and associated analysis are maturing rapidly, mechanisms are needed for processing the dense raw data efficiently with standard computer hardware, speeding development of detection algorithms, and harnessing communication networks to move data from the field to research facilities. Passive acoustic monitoring is a viable and cost-effective tool for conservation and should be incorporated in monitoring schemes much more broadly. The capability to quickly assess changes in behaviour, population size, and landscape use, simultaneously over large geographical areas, makes this approach attractive for detecting human-induced impacts and for assessing the success of conservation strategies.},

  abstract = {1. Effective wildlife habitat management and conservation requires understanding the factors influencing distribution and abundance of plant species. Field studies, however, have documented observation errors in visually estimated plant cover including measurements which differ from the true value (measurement error) and not observing a species that is present within a plot (detection error). Unlike the rapid expansion of occupancy and N-mixture models for analysing wildlife surveys, development of statistical models accounting for observation error in plants has not progressed quickly. Our work informs development of a monitoring protocol for managed wetlands within the National Wildlife Refuge System. 2. Zero-augmented beta (ZAB) regression is the most suitable method for analysing areal plant cover recorded as a continuous proportion but assumes no observation errors. We present a model extension that explicitly includes the observation process thereby accounting for both measurement and detection errors. Using simulations, we compare our approach to a ZAB regression that ignores observation errors (naive model) and an ad hoc approach using a composite of multiple observations per plot within the naive model. We explore how sample size and within-season revisit design affect the ability to detect a change in mean plant cover between 2years using our model. 3. Explicitly modelling the observation process within our framework produced unbiased estimates and nominal coverage of model parameters. The naive and ad hoc approaches resulted in underestimation of occurrence and overestimation of mean cover. The degree of bias was primarily driven by imperfect detection and its relationship with cover within a plot. Conversely, measurement error had minimal impacts on inferences. We found {$>$}30 plots with at least three within-season revisits achieved reasonable posterior probabilities for assessing change in mean plant cover. 4. For rapid adoption and application, code for Bayesian estimation of our single-species ZAB with errors model is included. Practitioners utilizing our R-based simulation code can explore trade-offs among different survey efforts and parameter values, as we did, but tuned to their own investigation. Less abundant plant species of high ecological interest may warrant the additional cost of gathering multiple independent observations in order to guard against erroneous conclusions.},

  abstract = {Forests are an important global resource, playing key roles in both the environment and the economy. The implementation of quality national monitoring programs is required for the generation of robust national statistics, which in turn support global reporting. Conventional monitoring initiatives based on samples of field plots have proven robust but are difficult and costly to implement and maintain, especially for large jurisdictions or where access is difficult. To address this problem, air photo- and satellite-based large area mapping and monitoring programs have been developed; however, these programs also require ground measurements for calibration and validation. To mitigate this need for ground plot data we propose the collection and integration of light detection and ranging (lidar) based plot data. Lidar enables accurate measures of vertical forest structure, including canopy height, volume, and biomass. Rather than acquiring wall-to-wall lidar coverage, we propose the acquisition of a sample of scanned lidar transects to estimate conditions over large areas. Given an appropriate sampling framework, statistics can be generated from the lidar plots extracted from the transects. In other instances, the lidar plots may be treated similar to ground plots, providing locally relevant information that can be used independently or integrated with other data sources, including optical remotely sensed data. In this study we introduce the concept of ‘‘lidar plots’’ to support forest inventory and scientific applications, particularly for large areas. Many elements must be considered when planning a transect-based lidar survey, including survey design, flight and sensor parameters, acquisition considerations, mass data processing, and database development. We present a case study describing the acquisition of over 25 000 km of lidar data in Canada’s boreal forests in the summer of 2010. The survey, which included areas of managed and unmanaged forests, resulted in the production of more than 17 million 25 ) 25 m lidar plots with first returns greater than 2 m in height. We conclude with insights gained from the case study and recommendations for future surveys.},

Lidar (light detection and ranging) has emerged as a robust means to collect and subsequently characterize vertically distributed attributes.

Comparing forest structural parameters retrieved using EVI data with extensive ground measurements, we found excellent agreement at the site level using five EVI scans (plots) per site (R2 = 0.94–0.99); very good agreement at the plot level for stem count density and biomass (R2 = 0.90–0.85); and good agreement at the plot level for mean DBH and basal area (R2 = 0.48–0.66). The observed variance at site and plot levels suggest that a sample area of at least 1 ha (104 m2) is required to estimate these parameters accurately at the stand level using either lidar-based or conventional methods. The algorithms and procedures used to retrieve these structural parameters are dependent on the unique ability of the Echidna® lidar to digitize the full waveform of the scattered lidar pulse as it returns to the instrument, which allows consistent separation of scattering by trunks and large branches from scattering by leaves. This successful application of ground-based lidar technology opens the door to rapid and accurate measurement of biomass and timber volume in areal sampling scenarios and as a calibration and validation tool for mapping biomass using airborne or spaceborne remotely sensed data.},

  abstract = {Recovery of grassland birds in agricultural landscapes is a global imperative. Agricultural landscapes are complex, and the value of resource patches may vary substantially among species. The spatial extent at which landscape features affect populations (i.e., scale of effect) may also differ among species. There is a need for regional-scale conservation planning that considers landscape-scale and species-specific responses of grassland birds to environmental change. We developed a spatially explicit approach to optimizing grassland conservation in the context of species-specific landscapes and prioritization of species recovery and applied it to a conservation program in Kentucky (USA). We used a hierarchical distance-sampling model with an embedded scale of effect predictor to estimate the relationship between landscape structure and abundance of eastern meadowlarks (Sturnella magna), field sparrows (Spizella pusilla), and northern bobwhites (Colinus virginianus). We used a novel spatially explicit optimization procedure rooted in multi-attribute utility theory to design alternative conservation strategies (e.g., prioritize only northern bobwhite recovery or assign equal weight to each species’ recovery). Eastern meadowlarks and field sparrows were more likely to respond to landscape-scale resource patch adjacencies than landscape-scale patch densities. Northern bobwhite responded to both landscape-scale resource patch adjacencies and densities and responded strongly to increased grassland density. Effects of landscape features on local abundance decreased as distance increased and had negligible influence at 0.8 km for eastern meadowlarks (0.7–1.2 km 95\% Bayesian credibility intervals [BCI]), 2.5 km for field sparrows (1.5–5.8 km 95\% BCI), and 8.4 km for bobwhite (6.4–26 km 95\% BCI). Northern bobwhites were predicted to benefit greatly from future grassland conservation regardless of conservation priorities, but eastern meadowlark and field sparrow were not. Our results suggest similar species can respond differently to broad-scale conservation practices because of species-specific, distance-dependent relationships with landscape structure. Our framework is quantitative, conceptually simple, customizable, and predictive and can be used to optimize conservation in heterogeneous ecosystems while considering landscape-scale processes and explicit prioritization of species recovery.},

Many jurisdictions are letting private interests and/or users of the resource base help fund conservation projects. Thus funding for conservation is becoming more dependent on donations to environmental causes either through direct giving of funds or through memberships in organizations. This study explores some determinants of private contributions to environmental conservation activities through an econometric analysis of donations and memberships relating to wildlife habitat protection and enhancement. We use data from a 1991 survey conducted in the three prairie provinces that provides information on donation behavior, income, wildlife-related activity, household compositions, and a variety of other factors. A double-hurdle econometric model is used to allow independent variables to have different effects on the probability of donations and the level of donations. Our empirical results suggest that changes in the economy will be important to donation behavior. Declines in participation and recruitment in hunting will also have impacts on donations to conservation causes, but these impacts, although significant, may not be as large. However, consumptive and nonconsumptive activities may be influenced by management agencies and used to bolster environmental donations.},

Although numerous techniques are available, there have been few comparisons of the precision and cost-effectiveness of different approaches. We assess the precision and cost of three methods for estimating densities of the Endangered Grevy's zebra Equus grevyi. We compare distance sampling and photographic capture-recapture, and a new technique, the random encounter model (REM) that uses camera-trap encounter rates to estimate density. All three methods provide comparable density estimates for Grevy's zebra and are preferable to the common practice of raw counts. Photographic capture-recapture is the most precise and line-transect distance sampling the least precise. Line transects and photographic capture-recapture surveys are cost-effective in the first year and REM is most cost-effective in the long-term. The methods used here for Grevy's zebra may be applied to other rangeland ungulates. We suggest that for single species monitoring programmes in which individuals can be identified, photographic capture-recapture surveys may be the preferred method for estimating wildlife abundances. When encounter rates are low, distance sampling lacks the precision of the other methods but its cost advantage may make it appropriate for long-term or multi-species monitoring programmes. The REM is an efficient and precise method of estimating densities but has high initial equipment costs. We believe REM has the potential to work well for many species but it requires independent estimates of animal movements and group size.},

  abstract = {Spectral mixture analysis has been an important research topic in remote sensing applications, particularly for hyperspectral remote sensing data processing. On the basis of linear spectral mixture models, this paper applied directed and weighted graphs to describe the relationship between pixels. In particular, we transformed the endmember extraction problem in the decomposition of mixed pixels into an issue of optimization and built feasible solution space to evaluate the practical significance of the objective function, thereby establishing two ant colony optimization algorithms for endmember extraction. In addition to the detailed process of calculation, we also addressed the effects of different operating parameters on algorithm performance. Finally we designed two sets of simulation data experiments and one set of actual data experiments, and the results of those experiments prove that endmember extraction based on ant colony algorithms can avoid some defects of N-FINDR, VCA and other algorithms, improve the representation of endmembers for all image pixels, decrease the average value of root-mean-square error, and therefore achieve better endmember extraction results than the N-FINDR and VCA algorithms.},

We conducted trials at 28 plots within six stands of hardwoods and conifers of varying height and stocking densities at Harvard Forest, Massachusetts, Bartlett Experimental Forest, New Hampshire, and Howland Experimental Forest, Maine, in July 2007. Effective LAI values retrieved by four methods, which ranged from 3.42 to 5.25 depending on the site and method, were not significantly different (β b 0.1 among four methods). The LAI values also matched published values well. Foliage profiles (leaf area with height) retrieved from the lidar scans, although not independently validated, were consistent with stand structure as observed and as measured by conventional methods. Canopy mean top height, as determined from the foliage profiles, deviated from mean RH100 values obtained from the Lidar Vegetation Imaging Sensor (LVIS) airborne largefootprint lidar system at 27 plots by − 0.91 m with RMSE = 2.04 m, documenting the ability of the EVI to retrieve stand height. The Echidna Validation Instrument is the first realization of the Echidna® lidar concept, devised by Australia's Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO), for measuring forest structure using full-waveform, ground-based, scanning lidar.},

  abstract = {1. It is important to understand metapopulation dynamics and underlying demographic processes in heterogeneous landscapes. Traditionally, demographic parameters are estimated using capture-recapture data that can be difficult to collect. Spatially explicit dynamicN-mixture models allow inference for demographic parameters, including dispersal, using count data of unmarked animals, but these models have only been shown effective under constant demographic parameters and dispersal between adjacent local populations. 2. In this study, I aimed to compensate the weakness of spatially explicit dynamicN-mixtures and multistate capture-recapture models by jointly analysing count and capture-recapture data. This spatially explicit integrated population model allows for spatiotemporal variation of demographic parameters in relation to environmental and density covariates and dispersal between any local populations. I conducted simulations to evaluate this model (a) for species with distinct life histories under different detection and capture probabilities, (b) when spatial sampling intensity varied, (c) when the length of survey period varied, (d) when the robust sampling design was adopted or not and (e) when auxiliary information is partially available. I also provided an empirical example of GadwallMareca streperametapopulation dynamics in North American prairies. 3. The results showed that the model provided unbiased parameter estimates under a variety of ecological and sampling conditions, even when the spatial sampling intensity of capture-recapture survey was low (20\% of the patches) with the complement of count data (¿= 60\% of the patches). Also, the model only required a relatively short survey period (6 similar to 8 years) to provide unbiased inferences. The robust sampling design was not necessary for the model to provide unbiased inferences when spatial counts were intense, but became critical when spatial counts were sparse. Parameter estimates remain unbiased when auxiliary information is partially available. The model showed that Gadwall had low emigration probability (11.8\%) but could disperse more than 200 km. 4. Based on the results, I provide recommendations about the trade-off between spatial sampling intensity, length of survey period and the use of the robust sampling design when applying this model in real-world studies. The model could have wide applications in the interface of metapopulation ecology and landscape ecology.},

  abstract = {Groundwater plays a vital role in the arid inland river basins, in which the groundwater management is critical to the sustainable development of area economy and ecology. Traditional sustainable management approaches are to analyze different scenarios subject to assumptions or to construct simulation-optimization models to obtain optimal strategy. However, groundwater system is time-varying due to exogenous inputs. In this sense, the groundwater management based on static data is relatively outdated. As part of the Heihe River Basin (HRB), which is a typical arid river basin in Northwestern China, the Daman irrigation district was selected as the study area in this paper. First, a simulation-optimization model was constructed to optimize the pumping rates of the study area according to the groundwater level constraints. Three different groundwater level constraints were assigned to explore sustainable strategies for groundwater resources. The results indicated that the simulation-optimization model was capable of identifying the optimal pumping yields and satisfy the given constraints. Second, the simulation-optimization model was integrated with wireless sensors network (WSN) technology to provide real-time features for the management. The results showed time-varying feature for the groundwater management, which was capable of updating observations, constraints, and decision variables in real time. Furthermore, a web-based platform was developed to facilitate the decision-making process. This study combined simulation and optimization model with WSN techniques and meanwhile attempted to real-time monitor and manage the scarce groundwater resource, which could be used to support the decision-making related to sustainable management.},

  abstract = {Effectively managing take of wildlife resulting from human activities poses a major challenge for applied conservation. Demographic data essential to decisions regarding take are often expensive to collect and are either not available or based on limited studies for many species. Therefore, modeling approaches that efficiently integrate available information are important to improving the scientific basis for sustainable take thresholds. We used the prescribed take level (PTL) framework to estimate allowable take for bald eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) in the conterminous United States. We developed an integrated population model (IPM) that incorporates multiple sources of information and then use the model output as the scientific basis for components of the PTL framework. Our IPM is structured to identify key parameters needed for the PTL and to quantify uncertainties in those parameters at the scale at which the United States Fish and Wildlife Service manages take. Our IPM indicated that mean survival of birds ¿1 year old was high and precise (0.91, 95\% CI = 0.90-0.92), whereas mean survival of first-year eagles was lower and more variable (0.69, 95\% CI = 0.62-0.78). We assumed that density dependence influenced recruitment by affecting the probability of breeding, which was highly imprecise and estimated to have declined from approximately 0.988 (95\% CI = 0.985-0.993) to 0.66 (95\% CI = 0.34-0.99) between 1994 and 2018. We sampled values from the posterior distributions of the IPM for use in the PTL and estimated that allowable take (e.g., permitted take for energy development, incidental collisions with human made structures, or removal of nests for development) ranged from approximately 12,000 to 20,000 individual eagles depending on risk tolerance and form of density dependence at the scale of the conterminous United States excluding the Southwest. Model-based thresholds for allowable take can be inaccurate if the assumptions of the underlying framework are not met, if the influence of permitted take is under-estimated, or if undetected population declines occur from other sources. Continued monitoring and use of the IPM and PTL frameworks to identify key uncertainties in bald eagle population dynamics and management of allowable take can mitigate this potential bias, especially where improved information could reduce the risk of permitting non-sustainable take.},

  abstract = {Understanding how habitat, landscape context, and human disturbance influence local species-specific deer density provides evidence informing strategic management of increasing deer populations. Across an extensive (187 km2) heterogeneous forest-mosaic landscape in eastern England, spatially explicit density surface models of roe deer Capreolus capreolus and introduced muntjac Muntiacus reevesi were calibrated by thermal imaging distance sampling (recording 1590 and 400 muntjac and roe deer groups, respectively, on 567~km of driven transects). Models related deer density to local habitat composition, recreational intensity, and deer density (roe deer models controlled for muntjac density and vice versa) at a local grain across 1162 composite transect segments, incorporating geographical coordinates accounting for spatial autocorrelation. Abundance of both species was lower in localities with more grasslands (inter-quartile, IQ, effect size: roe\,−2.9 deer/km2; muntjac\,−2.9 deer/km2). Roe abundance (mean\,=\,7~deer/km2, SD\,=\,6) was greater in localities with more young stands (IQ effect size,\,+\,1.3 deer/km2) and lower at localities with more recreationists (−1.1 deer/km2). Muntjac density (mean\,=\,21 deer/km2, SD\,=\,10) was greater in localities with more recreationists (+\,2.4 deer/km2), with more mature (≥\,46~years) stands (+\,1.5 deer/km2), or calcareous soil (+\,7.1 deer/km2). Comparison of models incorporating candidate variables and models comprising geographical coordinates only shows candidate variables to be weak predictors of deer densities. Adapting forest management to manipulate habitat and recreational access may influence local deer densities, but only subtly: effect sizes are not sufficient to mitigate deer impacts through planting vulnerable tree crops in areas avoided by deer. Effective culling remains the most viable management option.},

  abstract = {The ability to accurately predict patterns of species' occurrences is fundamental to the successful management of animal communities. To determine optimal management strategies, it is essential to understand species-habitat relationships and how species habitat use is related to natural or human-induced environmental changes. Using five years of monitoring data in the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal National Historical Park, Maryland, USA, we developed four multispecies hierarchical models for estimating amphibian wetland use that account for imperfect detection during sampling. The models were designed to determine which factors (wetland habitat characteristics, annual trend effects, spring/summer precipitation, and previous wetland occupancy) were most important for predicting future habitat use. We used the models to make predictions about species occurrences in sampled and unsampled wetlands and evaluated model projections using additional data. Using a Bayesian approach, we calculated a posterior distribution of receiver operating characteristic area under the curve (ROC AUC) values, which allowed us to explicitly quantify the uncertainty in the quality of our predictions and to account for false negatives in the evaluation data set. We found that wetland hydroperiod (the length of time that a wetland holds water), as well as the occurrence state in the prior year, were generally the most important factors in determining occupancy. The model with habitat-only covariates predicted species occurrences well; however, knowledge of wetland use in the previous year significantly improved predictive ability at the community level and for two of 12 species/species complexes. Our results demonstrate the utility of multispecies models for understanding which factors affect species habitat use of an entire community (of species) and provide an improved methodology using AUC that is helpful for quantifying the uncertainty in model predictions while explicitly accounting for detection biases.},

It requires the estimation of camera-animal observation distances, which previously was done by comparing animal positions to reference labels at predefined intervals. Here, we test a photogrammetry approach to derive camera-animal observation distances. We applied both, the reference label and photogrammetry approaches to five ungulate species varying widely in body size (Giraffa camelopardalis, Equus grevyi, Oryx dammah, Kobus megaceros and Eudorcas thomsonii) and one ground-dwelling bird species (Numida meleagris) inhabiting a large enclosure and estimated their density with CTDS. Both procedures provided highly correlated observation distances (rho = 0.99, p {$<$} 0.001). A paired t test revealed a minor but significantly higher mean of the photogrammetry approach (MD = 0.28 m, p {$<$} 0.001). This, however, seems negligible as for analyses, distances were grouped in intervals of 2 to 5 metres. In general, estimated animal abundance was close to the true number of individuals in the enclosure for both approaches, with the exception of zebra, whose density was underestimated. The photogrammetry approach offers an alternative approach for deriving camera-animal observation distances and is particularly useful for application in open habitats, with little occlusion of animals.},

  abstract = {Tourism has been widely used as a conservation strategy that directly compensates local people or management authorities, thereby contributing to development and creating incentives to preserve the landscape. Reserves or parks that are inhabited by flagship species may be able to generate more revenue through tourism than those without such species because flagship species have great potential for raising funds and creating publicity for conservation goals. In this paper, we examine flagship species tourism focused on observing the golden snub-nosed monkey (Rhinopithecus roxellana) in Shennongjia National Nature Reserve (SNNR). After the program was launched in 2006, both the number of tourists and amount of revenue received by SNNR increased as the general trends of tourism revenue in the country also increased. As a result, SNNR significantly increased reinvestment in tourism and conservation infrastructure. Furthermore, after senior politicians visited the golden snub-nosed monkey, they abruptly changed their attitudes toward biological conservation, as indicated by an increase in both regular and additional funding for the species conservation. We conclude that flagship species tourism may not only generate revenue for conservation and management but also can improve officials' attitudes toward preserving biodiversity. However, it is important to ensure the continued safety and sustainability of such programs, from both the human and animal perspective, and we suggest stricter measures are introduced to reduce the risk of aerosol disease transmission from tourists to the monkeys.},

  abstract = {Effective conservation requires strategies to monitor populations efficiently, which can be especially difficult for rare or elusive species where field surveys require high effort and considerable cost. Populations of many reptiles, including Sonoran desert tortoises (Gopherus agassizii), are challenging to monitor effectively because they are cryptic, they occur at low densities, and their activity is limited both seasonally and daily. We compared efficiency and statistical power of 2 survey methods appropriate for tortoises and other rare vertebrates, line-transect distance sampling and site occupancy. In 2005 and 2006 combined, we surveyed 120 1-km transects to estimate density and 40 3-ha plots 5 times each to estimate occupancy of Sonoran desert tortoises in 2 mountain ranges in southern Arizona, USA. For both mountain ranges combined, we estimated density to be 0.30 adult tortoises/ha (95\% CI = 0.17-0.43) and occupancy to be 0.72 (95\% CI = 0.56-0.89). For the sampling designs we evaluated, monitoring efforts based on occupancy were 8-36\% more efficient than those based on density, when contrasting only survey effort, and 17-30\% more efficient when contrasting total effort (surveying, hiking to and from survey locations, and radiotracking). Occupancy had greater statistical power to detect annual declines in the proportion of area occupied than did distance sampling to detect annual declines in density. For example, we estimated that power to detect a 5\% annual decline with 10 years of annual sampling was 0.92 (95\% CI = 0.75-0.98) for occupancy and 0.43 (95\% CI = 0.35-0.52) for distance sampling. Although all sampling methods have limitations, occupancy estimation offers a promising alternative for monitoring populations of rare vertebrates, including tortoises in the Sonoran Desert.},
